   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act reform included in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. Our provision updates the law, which hadn't been adjusted for inflation since it was enacted in 1976, and makes several improvements to the merger review process undertaken by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. It is a bipartisan measure, authored by Senators HATCH, LEAHY, DEWINE, and myself and Representatives HYDE and CONYERS, and it deserves our support. 
   The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is crucial to the enforcement of competition policy in today's economy--it ensures that the antitrust agencies have sufficient time to review mergers and acquisitions prior to their completion. The statute requires that, prior to consummating a merger or acquisition of a certain minimum size, the companies involved must formally notify the antitrust agencies and must provide certain information regarding the proposed transaction. For those transactions covered by the Act, the parties to a merger or acquisition may not close their transaction until the expiration of a waiting period after making their Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. It also authorizes the government to subpoena additional information from merging parties so that the government has sufficient information to complete its merger analysis. 
   While this statute has a very laudable purpose, especially with the tremendous numbers of mergers and acquisitions taking place in recent years, some of its provisions are in need of revision. Most importantly, while inflation has caused the value of a dollar to drop by more than a half in the past 25 years, the monetary test that subjects a transaction to the provisions of the statute has not been revised since the law's enactment in 1976. As a result, many transactions that are of a relatively small size and pose little antitrust concerns are nevertheless swept into the ambit of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process. This legislation updates this statute to better fit into today's economy by raising the minimum size of transaction covered by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from $15 million to $50 million. This will both lessen the agencies' burden of reviewing small transactions unlikely to seriously affect competition and enable the agencies to allocate their resources to properly focus on those transactions most worthy of scrutiny. 
   Further, exempting small transactions from the Hart-Scott-Rodino process will significantly lessen regulatory burdens and expenses imposed on small businesses. The parties to these smaller transactions will no longer need to pay the $45,000 filing fee--or face the often even more onerous legal fees and other expenses typically incurred in preparing a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing--for mergers and acquisitions that usually don't pose any competitive concerns. 
   In exempting this class of transactions from Hart-Scott-Rodino review, however, it is important that we not cause the antitrust agencies to lose the funding they need to carry out their increasingly demanding mission of enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. This bill will reduce the number of Hart-Scott-Rodino filings and therefore reduce the revenues generated by these filings if the filing fees were kept at their present level. Of course, in a perfect world, we wouldn't finance the Antitrust Division and the FTC on the backs of these filing fees. But because they are a fact of life, the antitrust agencies should not be penalized by these reforms by suffering such a reduction in revenues. As a result, in order to assure that this reform is revenue neutral, we have worked with the Appropriations Committee to ensure that this bill raises the filing fees for the largest transactions. Consequently, filing fees are to be increased for transactions valued at over $100,000,000, which makes sense because these transactions require more scrutiny. 
   This legislation makes other changes designed to enhance the efficiency of the pre-merger review process. The waiting period has been extended from twenty to thirty days after the parties' compliance with the government's request for additional information, a more realistic waiting period in this era of increasingly complex mergers generating enormous amounts of relevant information and documents. And, as in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a deadline for governmental action occurs on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is extended to the next business day. This simple provision will eliminate gamesmanship by parties who currently may time their compliance so that the waiting period ends on a weekend or holiday, effectively shortening the waiting period to the previous business day. 
   Finally, in recent years may have expressed concerns regarding the difficulties and expense imposed on business in complying with allegedly overly burdensome or duplicative government request for additional information. So our legislation also contains carefully crafted provisions to ensure that business is not faced with unduly burdensome or overbroad requests for information, while assuring that the antitrust agencies' ability to obtain the information necessary to carry out a merger investigation is not hampered. Specifically, our legislation mandates that the FTC and Antitrust Division designate a senior official who does not have direct authority for the review of any enforcement recommendation to be designated to hear appeals to the appropriateness of the government's information request (the so called ``Second Requests''). The bill also sets forth the specific standards that this senior official is to utilize when considering such an appeal and mandates that these appeals be heard in an expedited manner. 
   In sum, I believe this legislation to be a reasonable and well balanced reform of our government's vital merger review procedures. It will make long overdue adjustments in the filing thresholds--ensuring review of those mergers in most need of governmental scrutiny while reducing the burden and expense on government and private parties by exempting smaller transactions from often expensive and time consuming pre-merger filings. It will also significantly reform the merger review process to ensure that the government has sufficient time to analyze increasing complex merger transactions, while also adding protections so that private parties do not face unduly burdensome or duplicative information request. I urge swift passage of this measure.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to voice my support today for Glenn Fine, who would truly be an outstanding Inspector General at the Department of Justice. As you know, the Inspector General is charged with investigating waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. As such, it is a position of critical importance that we should have filled before adjourning for the year to ensure accountable and effective oversight of the DOJ. 
   Mr. Fine has been dealing with corruption ever since the Harvard-Boston  College basketball game on December 16, 1978, in which he scored 19 points and had 14 assists--perhaps his best performance in college--only to discover later that this particular game was part of a notorious point-shaving scandal. No doubt this first-hand experience drove him in his later quest to weed out corruption at the Department of Justice. 
   More seriously, though, Mr. Fine has served in a variety of professional roles and always in an exemplary fashion. He is currently the Director of the Special Investigations and Review Unit in the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General, where he has supervised a variety of sensitive internal investigations, including the FBI's handling of the Aldrich Ames case. He also worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, where he prosecuted more than 35 criminal jury trials. His academic credentials are stellar as well. He is a Rhodes Scholar and he was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. Finally, though this is a political appointment, Mr. Fine is non-partisan--exactly the type of appointee that a Republican President might very well consider keeping on. He worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney during the Reagan and Bush administrations, and has never been involved in a political campaign. 
   As this session of Congress comes to a close, a position as important as the Inspector General should have been filled. I'm only sorry that an individual as outstanding as Mr. Fine was not confirmed.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today this Congress has expanded accessibility to justice for hundreds of thousands of residents of northern Wisconsin by creating a Federal judgeship to sit in Green Bay, WI. Let me explain how this judgeship will alleviate the stress that the current system places on business, law enforcement agents, witnesses, victims and individual litigants in northeastern Wisconsin. 
   First, while the four full-time district court judges for the Eastern District of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee, for most litigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin. Milwaukee is well over 100 miles away. In fact, as the courts are currently arranged, the northern portion of the Eastern District is more remote from a Federal court than any other major population center, commercial or industrial, in the United States. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur substantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--costs in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed, driving from Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add inclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as Oconto or Marinette--and often the driving time alone actually exceeds the amount of time witnesses spend testifying. 
   Second, Wisconsin's Federal judges serve a disproportionately large population. I commissioned a study by the General Accounting Office which revealed that Wisconsin Federal judges serve the largest population among all Federal judges. Each sitting Federal judge in Wisconsin serves an average population of 859,966, while the remaining Federal judges across the country--more than 650--serve less than half that number, with an average of 417,000 per judge. For example, while Louisiana has fewer residents than Wisconsin, it has 22 Federal judges, nearly four times as many as our State. 
   Third, the Federal Government is required to prosecute all felonies committed by Native Americans that occur on the Menominee Reservation. The Reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors and courts--more than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic, and because the Justice Department compensates attorneys, investigators and sometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs all of us. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration of justice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously. 
   Fourth, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in northeastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court to litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with out-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these legitimate cases are never even filed--precisely because the northern part of the State lacks a Federal court. This hurts businesses not only in Wisconsin, but across the Nation. 
   In conclusion, having a Federal judge in Green Bay will reduce costs and inconvenience while increasing judicial efficiency. But most important, it will help ensure that justice is more available and more affordable to the people of northeastern Wisconsin.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4640, the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, which is the companion bill to my Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999. This bipartisan measure will put more criminals behind bars by correcting practical and legal shortcomings that leave too much crucial DNA evidence unused and too many violent crimes unsolved. 
   Currently, all 50 states require DNA samples to be obtained from certain convicted offenders, and these samples increasingly can be shared through a national DNA database established by Federal law. This national database--part of the Combined Database Index System (CODIS)--enables law enforcement officials to link DNA evidence found at a crime scene with any suspect whose DNA is already on file. By identifying repeat offenders, this DNA sharing can and does make a difference. Already the FBI reports that almost 1400 investigations have been aided by the DNA database, solving numerous crimes. And in my home state of Wisconsin, experience proves that DNA ``sharing'' pays off. In fact, just a week before the statute of limitations ran out in a multiple rape investigation, DNA matching helped identify a serial rapist responsible for three rapes in Kenosha and a fourth in Racine. As a result, he's currently serving an 80-year sentence. Without DNA databases, suspects like this otherwise might never be discovered--or convicted. 
   As valuable as this system is, it is not as effective as it could--or should--be. The effectiveness of the database is directly related to the number of DNA profiles it contains. For every 1,000 new profiles, we can expect to find at least one match, and with every new profile added, the odds for a match increase. However, there are currently two major obstacles to the effective functioning of the database. Our measure would correct these problems and make the database far more productive. 
   First, thousands of DNA samples that have already been collected still must be analyzed before they can be entered into the national database. The FBI estimates that there is a backlog of over 700,000 DNA samples from convicted offenders languishing, unanalyzed, in state crime laboratories for simple lack of funding. 
   Our measure will reduce the backlog of unanalyzed samples by providing the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ``on-line.'' It provides $45 million over three years to erase the backlog of the 700,000 unanalyzed samples and the almost-as-pressing backlog of approximately 220,000 more samples that need to be reanalyzed using state-of-the-art methods. 
   Indeed, easing this backlog was the lead recommendation of the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence appointed by the Attorney General. As the Commission explained, ``the power of the CODIS program lies in the sheer numbers of convicted offender samples that are processed and entered into the database.'' 
   Second, for some inexplicable reason, we do not collect samples from Federal 
   and D.C. offenders. So while the database can identify a suspect whose DNA is on file in one of the 50 states, it generally won't catch a Federal or D.C. offender. Under current law, that suspect will not be identified; his crime may not be solved; and he could get off scot-free. We thought we already closed this loophole through 1996 legislation which provides that the FBI ``may expand  [the database] to include Federal crimes and crimes committed in the District of Columbia,'' but Federal officials claim more express authority is necessary. We are not so sure they're right, but there is no need to wait any longer. 
   Our measure closes once and for all this loophole that allows DNA samples from Federal (including military) and Washington, D.C. offenders to go uncollected. Under our proposal, DNA samples would be obtained from any Federal offender--or any D.C. offender under Federal custody or supervision--convicted of a violent crime or other qualifying offense. And it would require the collection of samples from juveniles found delinquent under Federal law for conduct that would constitute a violent crime if committed by an adult. Our proposal was prepared with the assistance of the FBI, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Parole Commission, agencies within the District of Columbia responsible for supervision of released felons, and the Department of Defense. 
   Modern crime-fighting technology like DNA testing and DNA databases make law enforcement much more effective. But in order to take full advantage of these valuable resources, we need this measure to make the database as comprehensive--and as productive--as possible. Violent criminals should not be able to evade arrest simply because a state didn't analyze its DNA samples or because an inexcusable loophole leaves Federal and D.C. offenders out of the DNA database. This measure will ensure that we apprehend violent repeat offenders, regardless of whether they originally violated state, Federal or D.C. law. And, by collecting more DNA evidence and utilizing the best of DNA technology, we also can help exonerate individual suspects whose DNA does not match with particular crime scenes. 
   Mr. President, this measure will help police use modern technology to solve crimes and prevent repeat offenders from committing new ones. Let me credit Senators DEWINE, HATCH, LEAHY and Congressman MCCOLLUM for their hard work which is finally paying off.

   Mr. KOHL. I am happy to clarify this for my colleague. He is correct. The Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant Program was designed by Congress to enable rural communities to improve the quality of educational opportunities and medical service. I believe strongly that educational opportunities include worker retraining and transitional education. Applicants can partner with local businesses or businesses considering moving into a rural area. Schools, community colleges, and other teaching institutions partner with the private sector today. Within that mandate, this is a program that is truly limited only by the innovation of the rural communities it serves.

He is correct to point out the positive role of the Rural Community Assistance Programs in helping carry out this and other important activities in rural areas. The Senator is aware that the President requested $5 million for these solid waste grants for fiscal year 2001. But whereas there is a general acknowledgment of the effectiveness of the program, we are abe to fund the program only to a level of $2.7 million in this bill, due to broader fiscal constraints. In view of that limitation, I think the Senator is correct to urge the Department to give special consideration to those very small, often poor, rural communities which can be the hardest to serve. For that reason, I agree, and I believe the subcommittee would agree, that the Department should be urged to consider directing up to $1 million of the solid waste grants to the regional Rural Community Assistance Programs, which have an excellent record of serving such communities.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator COCHRAN, for all of his work in crafting this conference report. I believe overall this measure does a very good job of providing funds for ongoing work at USDA, FDA, and the other agencies covered in this bill. It also provides much needed emergency relief for farmers and ranchers suffering from both market loss and natural disasters. 
   However, I am disappointed that the conference committee could not come to a better conclusion on two highly controversial issues involving trade sanctions and reimportation of prescription drugs. 
   With regard to the Cuba provision, I would have preferred the Senate language. That language received broad support in this body. 
   With respect to the reimportation of prescription drugs, I am concerned the language in this report has too many restrictions and may not result in lower drug prices for our seniors, as well as others. 
   While some of us disagree on the language of these two items, nevertheless this conference report does provide immediate and targeted economic relief to struggling producers. Some producers are receiving the lowest prices for their products in over 20 years. 
   With respect to the dairy industry, the emergency provisions included in the conference report do not solve the larger problems facing our industry. However, it is an appropriate and vital step in protecting family dairy farmers. I encourage all Senators to support this conference report. 
   The conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture appropriations bill provides $78.5 billion in  funding for the operations and programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. This conference report includes much needed emergency relief to assist farmers hurt by economic and weather-related losses. The conference report also includes legislative language regarding food and medicine sanctions and language regarding the reimportation of prescription drugs. I am pleased that the conference committee also accepted a provision that will make it easier for citizens to participate in the federal food stamp program. 
   From the beginning of this year's appropriation cycle I have been honored to work with the very distinguished Chairman, Senator COCHRAN. The Senator from Mississippi has done an outstanding job of steering this bill through the appropriation process and I believe that with his leadership we have achieved a very fair and balanced conference report. 
   There are two highly controversial issues relating to this conference report which prevented the House and Senate conferees from moving this bill prior to today. In fact, the FY 2001 Agricultural Appropriations bill was reported by the full Appropriations Committee on May 20, 2000 and was approved by the full Senate on July 20, 2000. With farmers and ranchers struggling with significant market losses and natural disasters, it was my hope that we would have moved this legislation to the President's desk prior to the August recess period. 
   With regard to the Cuba language, I am disappointed that the conferees did not accept the language that was included in the Senate version of this bill. The language approved by the Senate received broad support and would have created expanded opportunities for Americans to sell food and medicine to Cuba. The provision included in this conference report makes it more difficult for these sales to take place, by preventing U.S. financial institutions from providing financing. The provision also codifies travel restrictions on Americans going to Cuba, making it more difficult for farmers to travel to Cuba to negotiate a sale. Although I do not believe we should be lifting our broader embargo on Cuba until we see democratic reform in Cuba and the end of the repressive Castro regime, in the meantime, I believe that blocking the sale of food and medicine has done little to bring us closer to that goal and has the unintended consequence of harming the very people we want to help. 
   With regards to the reimportation of prescription drugs, I am extremely disappointed with the process by which the conference provision was developed. We started with a very bipartisan process to develop workable language, but unfortunately, that process was hijacked. Instead, decisions were made in backroom deals behind closed doors. Even when improvements were suggested that would improve the language, they were ignored. This process was a disgrace to the Senate and to our nation's seniors who would benefit far more from a bipartisan process. 
   American consumers are rightly concerned about the high costs of prescription drugs--especially when compared to prices in other countries. These high costs are forcing America's seniors to often choose between buying food or paying for their medicine bills. America's seniors have footed the bill for the pharmaceutical industry's high profits for far too long. 
   I believe reimportation could help alleviate the high costs for many seniors, but I am concerned that the language in this conference report has several loopholes that will prevent it from being fully effective. In particular, I am concerned that the sunset provision will have a chilling effect on pharmacists and wholesalers, who may not invest in reimportation because the ability to do so will end in five years. And I am very concerned that drug companies can still keep American prices high by demanding that foreign sellers charge American pharmacists and wholesalers the higher, American-set prices when they reimport drugs. All of these issues, of course, could have been resolved in a bipartisan process. 
   That said, I am hopeful that the spirit of the reimportation provision--to lower drug prices for American consumers--will become a reality as it is implemented. Let me remind the drug companies in this country that reimportation was overwhelmingly supported in both Houses of Congress. We fully expect drug companies to comply with the intent of the law, and not look for loopholes to continue to inflate their profits. 
   Most importantly, let me say that while reimportation is an important first step toward helping seniors with high drug prices, make no mistake: this is not a substitute for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Anyone who claims that reimportation is the answer to the outrageous drug prices seniors face is out of step with reality. 
   Drug prices are a major problem--but so is coverage. With one-third of seniors lacking any drug coverage at all, it is critical that we pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit as soon as possible. 
   While some of us may disagree with the outcome on the Cuba sanctions and re-imported drug issues, this conference report does provide immediate and targeted economic relief to struggling farmers and ranchers. In my state of Wisconsin alone, we are losing three dairy farmers a day. While the dairy market loss payments included in this conference report does not solved the larger problems facing our industry, it is an appropriate and vital step necessary to protect our family farmers. 
   Section 805 of the conference report provides assistance to dairy farmers in an amount equal to 35% of the drop in the price this year from the previous five year average. Let me restate that, ``35%'' of the ``drop'' in price. By contrast, earlier this year the administration proposed a farm emergency package for program crops that would have provided payments to guarantee farmers of certain commodities ``95%'' of the previous 5 year average ``total gross income''. 
   I cannot overstate the devastation the current dairy price collapse is bringing to family farms all 
   across America. Back home in Wisconsin, the crises is overwhelming. Recently, I received a call from a dairy producer named Tom LaGesse of Bloomer, Wisconsin. Mr. LaGesse informed me that in his small town, located in northwest Wisconsin, five producers within the span of one week went out of business. He also told me that if we do not provide immediate, and direct emergency payments within 60 days, he would be the next producer to go out of business. All too often we hear a lot of talk about saving the family farm but little action. Mr. President, these dairy payments will hopefully save Mr. LaGesse and many, many others like him. 
   I am aware that producers may have questions regarding the implementation of the dairy payments included in this conference report. That is why I would like to insert into the RECORD the following questions and answers that may address the concerns of producers across the country. 
   Questions and Answers Regarding Emergency Dairy Payments 
   Question: How soon after the President signs this bill into law can dairy producers expect to receive payments? 
   Answer: For existing dairy farmers who received Dairy Market Loss Assistance payments earlier this year, payments should go out fairly quickly. New producers who have not previously applied for or received Dairy Market Loss Assistance payments from USDA may wait a little longer. 
   Question: How will payments be calculated? 
   Answer: Each producer's payment will be calculated by multiplying their ``eligible'' production by the payment rate. The payment rate equals 35 percent of the decline in the market value of milk in 2000 from the previous five year average. During 1995-99, the market value of all farm milk as reported by USDA was $14.25 per hundredweight. USDA currently projects the all milk price will average $12.40 per hundredweight in 2000, so the projected payment rate would be .35 times $1.85 or about 65-cents per hundredweight. 
   Eligible production for existing producers who received payments under the earlier program will, in most instances, be their actual milk production marketed in either 1997 or 1998, whichever is higher, up to a limit of 3.9 million pounds. Eligible production for existing producers who received payments under the earlier program, but had no production in 1997 or 1998, will be their actual milk production marketed in 1999 up to a limit of 3.9 million pounds. 
   Existing producers in either of the above categories who had less than 12 months of production in the base year used to calculate their earlier payments will have the option of substituting their actual production marketed during the 12 months from October 1,  1999, through September 30, 2000, up to a limit of 3.9 million, if it is greater than their base period marketings used for the earlier payments. 
   Finally, eligible production for new producers who did not receive payments under the earlier programs will be their actual production marketed during the 12 months from October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2000, up to a limit of 3.9 million pounds. 
   Question: Does a producer have to fill out forms or can they expect to automatically receive their payment? 
   Answer: The Secretary of Agriculture will decide exactly how to administer the program and what will be required of producers. However, I believe he can automatically pay existing producers who participated in the earlier payment programs and that only those new producers and those few who have the option of updating their base period production should need to fill out new applications. 
   Question: How much should producers expect to receive? 
   Answer: First, a producer's payment does not depend directly on the number of cows on the producer's farm but on the producer's eligible production as described above. A producer can estimate his own payment by multiplying his eligible production by the estimated payment rate of 65-cents per hundredweight. An average milk cow produces 17,200 pounds of milk per year. Using this average, producers can expect about $112 per milk cow. A herd of 225 average milk cows will reach the 3.9 million pound limit and receive the maximum payment of about $25,000.  
   Also included in the conference report is a cranberry relief package that provides assistance to cranberry growers who are suffering with record low prices. This year, my state of Wisconsin will lead the nation in cranberry production. The language in the conference report provides $20 million for direct cash payments to growers and language directing the USDA to purchase $30 million worth of cranberry products. 
   The cranberry direct payments provision is similar to other market loss assistance provisions in the bill. In order to insure that the funds are equitably distributed in the market place, the provision includes a cap on payments that would be limited to not more than 1.6 million pounds per separate farm unit, regardless of farm ownership. 
   In recent weeks, the cranberry industry has been working very closely with USDA and the recipients of federal food distribution programs to support purchases of juice concentrate, frozen fruit, or other comparable high-concentration fruit products that will remove the highest quantities of surplus fruit from current inventory. The industry and USDA is working to ensure a nutritious and easy to use product available for the recipients of federal food distribution programs. I appreciate the close cooperation of the Department on this and urge them to move quickly to address this disastrous surplus situation through additional purchases of products containing high concentrations of cranberry products provided for in the bill. 
   I close by reminding my colleagues that I support the conference report. I also express my sincere appreciation to Senator COCHRAN for his leadership, his fairness, and expertise in the many programs and accounts included in this bill. I thank Senator COCHRAN's subcommittee staff for all their work on this conference report. I urge all Senators to join me in support of this important conference report. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to explain my votes on the amendments offered by Senator BOXER to the VA-HUD Appropriations bill relating to legislative riders that were attached to the bill. Included in the bill were provisions that would potentially delay the issuance of rules on arsenic, the declaration of new ozone non-attainment areas, and ordering dredging for the clean up of PCB's. Senator BOXER offered amendments that would have eliminated or weakened these provisions. She has worked hard for our environment, and has been a leader on ecological issues, so I regret I had to vote against her proposals. Unfortunately I had to oppose her for several reasons. First, the amendments, if accepted would have seriously disrupted Congress's efforts to complete our work on the budget. These amendments would have resulted in additional delays, and could have jeopardized the fate of the bill. 
   I was also concerned because the Administration did not oppose, and did not agree with the dire assessment of the effects of these riders. Staff at the EPA do not believe that these riders will result in any significant delays. EPA does not believe that the dredging language included in the bill will delay action on the Fox River in my state, but it will ensure that we use the best science available when EPA develops clean up plans. 
   Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, along with the Administration, have done their best to neuter destructive language that was included in the House version of this bill, and I think they have done well. We would prefer that these riders not be included at all, but if they must, at least they were included in a way that is unlikely to have any negative effect on the environment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has been able to pass, after extended debate, H.R. 4444 which will make Normal Trade Relations with China permanent. After over twenty years of yearly extensions of Most Favored Nation trading status, we are now going to stabilize our trading relations with the Chinese. This is a step forward for the United States, China, and our citizens. 
   I believe in trade as a liberalizing force. A country cannot accept our goods and services and not be exposed to our ideas and values. One has only to look around the Pacific to see countries that have made the move from dictatorship to democracy and see their focus on trade to understand the connection. South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia have all made steps toward greater democracy and all three have been engines for economic growth in the region. As capitalism penetrates Chinese society, the push for greater democracy will inexorably follow. 
   Increased trade and investment between our countries will separate Chinese workers from dependence on state owned enterprises. Currently Chinese workers depend on the state for almost everything including their jobs and paychecks. Once workers have a choice between working for the government and for private business, and can break their dependency on the state, the push for greater democracy will only increase.  
   Trade will also serve as a valuable tool for exchanges between our countries as a more personal form of diplomacy. As business people travel back and forth, as workers meet Americans, as the Chinese people have more exposure to our country through the media and the internet, the people of China will develop there own attitudes about Westerners, capitalism, and democracy. 
   The World Trade Organization will bring China the prestige and respect it craves, but at a price. As a member, China will be treated like any other member of the international community, and not like an outcast or rogue. The members of the WTO, however, will not let themselves be taken advantage of in trade matters. During this debate I have heard many members talk about the advantage of multilateral sanctions over unilateral ones. The WTO offers members an excellent mechanism to propound and enforce multilateral sanctions, forcing China's compliance on trade issues. 
   While the agreement that the Administration negotiated in the fall of 1999 is not perfect, it significantly equalizes the terms of trade between our countries. Not only did we convince the Chinese to drastically reduce their tariffs on everything from auto parts to ice cream, we also negotiated to keep our anti-dumping and import surge laws. On our side, we gave up nothing in exchange. We did not allow any additional access to our markets or lower our tariffs. It was a one way deal--a deal that U.S. farmers and workers benefit from. People may be concerned about Chinese imports into the United States, but this agreement does not alter China's access to our markets one bit. On our side of the Pacific, nothing will change. 
   Some of my colleagues were disappointed that workers' rights provisions were not provided for in this agreement. I share their concern that China does not share our belief in the importance of respecting working people. I believe that Senator HELMS had an excellent proposal for raising the working conditions in China, while protecting the reputations of U.S. businesses that operate in China. His amendment to create a voluntary Code of Conduct for U.S. businesses in China would go a long way in protecting Chinese workers. By agreeing to respect certain rights to organize, to earn a decent wage, and to work in a safe environment, Chinese workers would learn the benefits of American style capitalism. This would also protect U.S. companies from being accused of abusing foreign workers for economic gain. We all know the public relations albatross around the neck of companies that moved to third world countries and thought they did not have a responsibility to meet Western standards of worker protection. We all know the names of companies who have operations in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Central America that have been brought under harsh scrutiny when the public finds out what the conditions are in these factories. Senator HELMS's amendment provided an opportunity for companies to avoid this negative publicity by agreeing openly that certain principals will always be respected, regardless of whether the factory is in China or the United States. 
   As we focus on expanding economic ties with China, we must consider our decision to grant PNTR in the context of our broader foreign policy relationship with China. I count myself among those who support PNTR in the hope that expanded trade with China will result in a more open Chinese society. To that end, we must be persistent in pressing the Chinese to demonstrate respect for human rights. Since the May 1999 suspension of the bilateral dialogue on Chinese human rights we have continued to convey our concerns to the Chinese about their repressive policies. Their unwillingness to engage with us on these issues puts more pressure on us to use the trade and economic contacts we have to press them on human rights and other matters. 
   Although I chose not to support the Wellstone amendment which would have conditioned PNTR on specific steps to improve religious freedom in China because I do not believe we should be adding last minute conditions to PNTR, I am deeply concerned about the most recent State Department reports on human rights and religious freedom in China. The Chinese government's respect for religious freedom and human rights has deteriorated considerably in recent years. Reports of severe violations continue unabated, including harsh crackdowns against religious and minority groups, the imprisonment of religious and minority leaders, including Catholic bishops, the complete repression of political freedom, and violence against women, including forced abortions, sterilizations, and prostitution. 
   There are those who say that we are losing our leverage with the Chinese on human rights by giving up our annual review of their human rights practices before we grant them normal trade relations status. In practice, however, this review had become a formality. We have never denied the Chinese normal trade relations status, even in recent years, since the Tianneman Square uprising, when their human rights record has been so egregious. I have believed that trade can be used as an effective bargaining tool in pressuring governments to improve their records on human rights. In the case of China, PNTR will not only provide us with the opportunity to press the Chinese at the 
   highest levels, expanded trade will expose the Chinese people to the many freedoms we hold so dear, creating pressure from within. 
   We will also not be losing our opportunity to monitor Chinese human rights practices in a public way. The legislation before us creates a Helsinki-style commission which is designed to keep human rights on the front burner of US-Chinese relations. We must monitor Chinese behavior, speak plainly to the Chinese, and take action when necessary to communicate our objections to China's human rights record. And, we must continue our support for U.S. government and non-government efforts to effect change in China, including the development of the rule of law. 
   We must also use our growing access to China to do all we can to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. The proliferation of these weapons and the ballistic missiles designed to deliver them pose the greatest threat to our security in the post-Cold War era. One of the consequences of the end of the Cold War has been looser controls on the technology, materials, and expertise to develop weapons of mass destruction. We must do all we can to prevent terrorists or radical states from acquiring these weapons and the means to deliver them. To that end, we have been a leader in setting up international regimes to prevent the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, there is much evidence that the Chinese have been heavily involved in proliferation activities. 
   Although some would argue that the Chinese have made progress in this area, pointing to their 1992 promise to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, their accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, their signing and subsequent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, CWC, and the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there are still grave concerns about Chinese proliferation activities. At the same time that China was making commitments to adhere to international regimes to prevent the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles, Chinese companies continued to transfer sensitive technology to a number of countries. These technologies were instrumental in the development of weapons programs. Missile technology sales to Pakistan, nuclear technology sales to Iran, chemical sales to Iran, and missile technology sales to North Korea have all been attributed to the Chinese. China has played a major role in Pakistan's nuclear program, selling Pakistan 5,000 ring magnets, which can be used in gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, and other equipment for their nuclear facilities. As recently as August 9, the CIA reported that China is still a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology, confirming for the first time missile technology sales to Libya. 
   The few advances China has made, at least in its formal commitments, can be attributed to U.S. pressure. The key to preventing the further spread of sensitive weapons technology and know how is to continue to press the Chinese to honor the spirit of these commitments. We must not be afraid to be  tough with them in this area and we must be willing to use all tools--including sanctions--to bring this message home. Global security is at risk if we allow rogue states to develop the capability to build weapons of mass destruction. And, our own national security is directly at stake if they develop delivery systems, that is long-range ballistic missiles, to bring these weapons to our shores. 
   That is why I chose to support the Thompson-Torricelli amendment to require annual reviews of Chinese proliferation activities. If the review identifies persons or other entities engaging in these activities then sanctions would be imposed. I have been a long-time supporter of economic sanctions against companies and governments which engage in proliferation activities. I recognize that sanctions may not always be appropriate, and that is why Thompson-Torricelli had waiver provisions. However, sanctions have not been imposed in many cases that begged for a stronger response from our government. The reluctance to use sanctions sends a signal to the Chinese and others involved in proliferation activities that there are rarely consequences for bad actions. We must have teeth in our non-proliferation policy or in the end we will suffer the consequences. 
   I had no desire to delay PNTR in my support of the Thompson amendment, and I can say the same for all the amendments which I chose to support during our consideration of PNTR. Our trade ties can benefit us in all our dealings with the Chinese, but we must not permit trade to overshadow the broad range of interests which we have with them. 
   I have no illusions about the potential impact of what we have done. PNTR will not change the balance of trade overnight. This agreement will take time to have a liberalizing effect on the Chinese government. China is thousands of years old, we will not change their minds in a couple of years, regardless of whether we use carrots or sticks to persuade them. We need to continue working to reduce subsidies below their current levels, and continue to eliminate tariffs. The U.S. will also need to continue to work on human rights as well. The bill provides some of the tools for the work on human rights to carry on, but we must be diligent and stay focused on the task ahead.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator FEINSTEIN in introducing the Defective Product Penalty Act of 2000. 
   As the Firestone/Bridgestone tire controversy sadly demonstrates, current consumer protection laws do not provide sufficient incentive for some manufacturers to put the health and safety of consumers at the forefront of their business decisions. Although most of us would find it very difficult to believe that a company knowingly introduced a defective product into the marketplace, or failed to recall one once a defect was discovered, the families of the Firestone/Bridgestone casualties do not need to be reminded that it does happen. Most companies are responsible corporate citizens, of course--and for them this legislation will not affect their behavior--but for the others who need to be ``incentivized'' to make consumer health and safety a foremost priority, the Defective Product Penalty Act (``DPPA'') should serve as sufficient notice. 
   Specifically, the DPPA creates tough criminal penalties for those who knowingly introduce defective products into the stream of commerce with the realization that the product may cause death or bodily harm to an unsuspecting consumer. Risking the lives of millions of Americans because a cost-benefit analysis suggests that profits earned from a product outweigh the potential costs of liability is not only wrong, but also criminal. And it should be treated as such. Indeed, Mr. President, whenever a company adheres to the bottom line instead of respecting the health and safety of their consumers, they deserve severe, immediate, and strict punishment. 
   This bill also incorporates S. 957, the Sunshine in Litigation Act. This part of the bill ensures that consumers are better informed about product defects that may affect consumer health and safety. All too often our Federal courts allow vital information that is discovered in litigation--and which bears directly upon public health and safety--to be covered up, to be shielded from mothers, fathers and children whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the public officials we have asked to protect our public health and safety. 
   All this happens because of the use of so-called ``protective orders''--really gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep information discovered in the course of litigation secret and undisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request to keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants threaten that, without secrecy, they will fight every document requested and will refuse to agree to a settlement. Victims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, typically they do not--because both sides have agreed. 
   The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public health and safety has been apparent for many years. The Judiciary Committee first held hearings on this issue in 1990 and again in 1994. In 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, told us, ``The one thing we learned . . . is that this problem is far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the length and depth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of civil litigation in this country is taking place in secret.'' 
   The Defective Product Penalty Act will go a long way to ensuring that the health and safety of consumers will receive the consideration it deserves in the boardrooms and courtrooms across our country. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Privacy Commission Act'' with my colleagues Senator THOMPSON and Senator TORRICELLI. This legislation addresses privacy protection by creating an expert Commission charged with the duty to explore privacy concerns. We cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. Privacy matters, and it will continue to matter more and more in this information age of high speed data, Internet transactions, and lightning-quick technological advances. 
   Last November, Senator TORRICELLI and I introduced the ``Privacy Protection Study Commission Act of 1999,'' the first major piece of privacy legislation introduced in the 106th Congress. Our hope then, as now, was to gain a better informed understanding of the numerous privacy issues facing a high tech culture. Now, almost a year later, the privacy issue has grown in importance and public concern. As a result, I am pleased to renew my effort in this area with another privacy commission proposal. 
   There exists a massive wealth of information in today's world, which is increasingly stored electronically. In fact, experts estimate that the average American is ``profiled'' in up to 150 commercial electronic databases. That means that there is a great deal of data--in some cases, very detailed and personal--out there and easily accessible courtesy of the Internet revolution. With the click of a button it is possible to examine all sorts of personal information, be it an address, a criminal record, a credit history, a shopping preference, or even a medical file. 
   Generally, the uses of this data are benign, even beneficial. Occasionally, however, personal information is obtained surreptitiously, and even peddled to third parties for profit or other uses. This is especially troubling when, in many cases, people do not even know that their own personal information is being ``shopped.'' 
   Two schools of thought exist on how we should address these privacy concerns. There are some who insist that we must do something and do it quickly. Others urge us to rely entirely on ``self-regulation''--according to them most companies will act reasonably and, if not, consumers will demand privacy protection as a condition for their continued business. 
   Both approaches have some merit, but also some problems. It is never beneficial to legislate by anecdote or on the basis of a few bad actors. In deed, enacting ``knee-jerk,'' ``quick-fix'' legislation could do more harm than good. By the same token, however, the longer Congress waits to enact legislation, the more frequent the anecdotes until they reach a point of critical mass. We are quickly reaching the point when Congress must act with or without the benefits of a study. 
   A privacy commission still has merit. The streamlined time frame--it could still be a bit shorter--helps ensure that the Commission will not interrupt other legislative privacy efforts, and the breadth of experts that it relies upon suggests that the commission's report will still be timely and worthwhile. 
   I commend Senator THOMPSON for his efforts and hope our proposal becomes law and Commission members are appointed before the end of this year.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act and urge that it be brought to the Senate floor for a vote. 
   Sadly, breast and cervical cancer will afflict nearly 200,000 women this year, and take the lives of more than 45,000. Women in every State and every community in the country are today facing the daunting challenge of overcoming these diseases. They are not strangers; they are our sisters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers. They are people we love and care about. 
   The statistics are disturbing. The family stories are sobering. But let us find hope in the strides that we have made so far. In 1991, Congress created the Early Detection Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provided low-income, uninsured women with breast and cervical cancer screening services. It was a positive first step toward ensuring that every woman, regardless of her annual income and insurance situation, could request a screening for breast and cervical cancer. I wholeheartedly support the program, and I know many of my colleagues do as well. 
   However, just as critical as guaranteeing universal access to cancer screening is the need to provide treatment options following a diagnosis of cancer. While the CDC Early Detection Program supplies participating women with an evaluation, it offers nothing in the way of treatment should that evaluation reveal cancer. The very same women who are not expected to pay for a screening are somehow expected to finance their own treatment program. It simply does not make sense. 
   We must, therefore, draw a line from A to B, from screening to treatment. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, a bill I am pleased to co-sponsor, does just that. It gives States the option of offering Medicaid coverage to women that participated in the CDC Early Detection Program and were diagnosed as having breast or cervical cancer. In so doing, it provides a much-needed complement to the Early Detection Program. 
   We have broad bipartisan support in the Senate to pass this bill. Nearly 80 Senators have cosponsored it. The program was included in the President's fiscal year 2001 budget. But we need a vote. 
   As time in this Congressional term wanes, we are increasingly forced to make difficult choices about which bills to address. But I believe this bill must be a top priority. It is unacceptable that women who are diagnosed with cancer often go without life-saving treatment simply because they cannot afford it. Congress has the responsibility to act quickly on this issue. 
   In the spirit of the CDC Early Detection program, which is approaching its 10th anniversary, I urge the leadership to bring S. 662 to the floor as soon as possible, and advance America's fight against breast and cervical cancer.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, 56 years ago today, the United States Marine Corps landed on the island of Guam to liberate its people from Japanese occupation. One of the marines involved in that action was William Grant Smith Neal who subsequently received the Purple Heart for wounds sustained during action on that island the following day. William Neal died on July 9, 2000 and one more American veteran of World War II has been taken from us. To honor Mr. Neal, and all veterans who served during that war, I believe it is fitting to outline the life of this man as a tribute to his generation which offered every full measure to keep this country safe. 
   On January 22, 1923, in Utica, Kansas, was born the first child to Glenn and Bessie Neal. As evidence of close attachment with family (which has become a Neal trademark) Glenn and Bessie wanted to name their son William Grant Neal after his grandparents, William Neal and Grant Smith. In the excitement, the doctor became confused and the name affixed to the baby's birth certificate was William Grant Smith Neal. However, to family and friends, he became known simply as Bill. 
   In fact, it was not until Bill entered the Marine Corps 18 years later that a document search revealed the complete scope of Bill Neal's full name. 
   Bill's father was employed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad and his job relocated him and the entire Neal family in the late 1920's to Horace, Kansas, a community located nearly on the Colorado border and right in the middle of the coming Dust Bowl. As a child, Bill soon became familiar with athletics and was a member of the Horace Elementary Basketball Team during the 5th and 6th grade. While playing in a double elimination tournament, Bill's team won the final game, but with only three players remaining; all others had fouled out. Just like life in the West Kansas plains during the 1920's and 30's, playing basketball there was tough stuff, and Bill proved he had what it took: he was one of the final three. 
   By the mid-1930's, the Neal family was moving again, this time to Hoisington, Kansas, where firm roots were put down. At Hoisington High School, Bill again excelled in sports as the football quarterback and in basketball and track. Naturally, his little sisters were very proud of him and anytime they would see Bill in downtown Hoisington, they would rush to his side and try to engage him in conversation. Being the big brother, however, Bill's response to such attention was normally the command, ``Go Home!" 
   Other girls were more successful. On one occasion, a girl in Bill's class appeared at the Neal home, knocked on the door, and asked for Bill. When Bill stepped outside, she quickly kissed him and ran away. 
   She wasn't taking the chance of being told to go home. 
   After High School, Bill pursued higher education at Wichita University, known today as Wichita State University, on a football scholarship. But world events were soon to disrupt Bill Neal's formal education for 4 years and, instead, provide him a role in one of the most important events of the 20th Century. 
   The December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor stirred the hearts of many young Americans intent on protecting our nation's shores and interests from evil forces then afoot in the world. Bill Neal was no exception. 
   Although not yet of age to enlist without parental consent, Bill immediately sought to join the U.S. Marine Corps and asked his father for approval. However, his father, himself a veteran of the First World War, was not eager to watch his young son march off to what he knew awaited on distant battlefields and, instead, sent him back to school in Wichita until such time that Bill would otherwise have to sign up for the draft. That time soon came and on July 11, 1942, Bill Neal entered the United States Marine Corps and set off from Kansas by rail to Marine boot camp in San Diego, California. Bill had never before stepped foot outside the state of Kansas, but now he was about to enter a far and dangerous world. 
   After boot camp, Bill was sent to New Zealand, which was then a staging area for hostile activities in the South Pacific. On his first Sunday there, Bill attended service at a local Methodist Church where he met the Craig family: Bob, his sons Bruce, Wallace, and Russell and Auntie Maggie. Following service, the Craigs invited Bill home for dinner and in a short time, he had become their ``adopted son''. Auntie Maggie taught him to drink tea in her kitchen and Wallace took him to rugby games. 
   The friendship which developed between Bill and the Craigs continued through the years and Bill and his wife Natalie recently made a trip to New Zealand to renew that friendship. Just last year, Russell Craig and his wife Iris made a trip to America where Bill and Natalie served as their guide from one coast all the way to the other. 
   But, the South Pacific in the 1940's was no vacation spot. Before long, Bill embarked from New Zealand for less hospitable receptions on Bouganville and Guadalcanal. The taste of Auntie Maggie's tea was soon replaced with the stench of hot, wet jungles. 
   On July 21, 1944, Bill Neal came ashore at Guam in the second wave landing on Asan Red Beach. One day later, July 22nd, Bill was in a foxhole with four other marines when the direct hit of a Japanese shell fell right on their location. Three of Bill's companions were killed instantly. Bill would  oftentimes say that every day of his life after that foxhole was a gift. It was a gift, to him and to all of us. 
   The wounds Bill suffered on Guam placed him in a Honolulu hospital, and after recovering he went home to Hoisington for what was to be an extended leave. But meanwhile, the storming of Iwo Jima and its resulting high number of casualties forced the military to call available servicemen back into the theater of operations. So ended Bill's home leave and once again, he was kissing his mother goodby and boarding a train for the Pacific and a ship back to Guam where he was made pack-ready to invade Japan. 
   Bill was under no allusion. Everyone knew that an American invasion of the Japanese home islands would be very grim work and the chances of survival not promising. But that was exactly the breach into where Bill Neal was about to step when word came of the flight of the Enola Gay, the dropping of two Atomic Bombs, and the surrender of Japan. Bill often acknowledged that Harry Truman, in making the momentous decision to use atomic weapons, not only ended the war, but also saved his life. 
   With the war's end, Bill returned to the beloved homeland for which he had risked his life, and nearly paid the ultimate sacrifice. He readjusted to civilian life and was by 1946 enrolled at Manhattan, Kansas, in the Kansas State College, now Kansas State University, with a major in Agriculture Education and a membership in the Acacia Fraternity. He was heard to claim that he had returned to his native soil to ``marry a little Kansas farm girl''. He was soon to get his wish. 
   One September night in 1946, Bill and a group of his friends drove out into the Riley County countryside with the less-than-noble intention of appropriating some watermelons from a nearby farm. The car in which they were riding was not properly large enough for the task and Bill found that someone was going to have to sit on his lap. Not to his dismay, that someone was a little Kansas farm girl from near Elbing, who, though an accomplice in the affair, was probably far more innocent than anyone else involved. But watermelons aside, Bill Neal had met his ``little Kansas farm girl'' and it is doubtful if any other raid has been ever so successful. 
   Two days before Christmas of the following year, Natalie Baker's mother put her daughter on a bus in nearby Newton, Kansas, and within a number of hours, Natalie had arrived in Bill's hometown of Hoisington to meet the entire Neal family for the first time, visit the minister's house, and get married, all in one day. At the wedding there was only one guest, uninvited at that, by the name of Rex Archer who was one of Bill's fraternity brothers in Manhattan. After the ceremony, Bill's mother prepared a feast and sitting at the table, Rex demanded Natalie's attention and told her to take a good look at the man she had just married. ``Just look at that,'' he told her, ``just see what your kids are going to look like!'' Bill's father thought that was pretty funny. To Natalie it may have been a little sobering, but it was too late to back out, not that she would have anyway. 
   Less than a year later, it was time to test the prediction. On September 29, 1948, Bill and Natalie Neal had their first child, Candi, born in Manhattan, Kansas. The following night, Bill's fraternity brothers gathered outside Natalie's room in the hospital to serenade her and her infant daughter with the Acacia Sweetheart Song. 
   By January of 1950, Bill had graduated from college, but jobs were hard to find and his first post-graduation employment was in the form of temporary jobs in eastern Colorado and Salina, Kansas. It was in Salina on August 19, 1950, that Bill and Natalie's second child, a son named Bill, Junior, was born, known to all of us now as Billy. The Neal family was now complete. 
   Not long afterward, Bill was offered a position as an instructor in Ellsworth, Kansas, teaching veterans skills related to agriculture. To Bill, this was a very rewarding experience and one which 
   gave him many long lasting friendships with his students. However, another vocation was calling. In 1953, Bill was offered a job as claims adjuster with the Farm Bureau Insurance Company, which began a career that lasted more than 30 years. After a short training session in Great Bend, Bill was assigned to the Farm Bureau office in Garden City. 
   The early 1950's were particularly brutal in western Kansas where dry, hot, windy days would kick up dust storms from which it was nearly impossible to escape. One Spring day in 1955, Bill was on the phone to a Farm Bureau office in eastern Kansas talking about the possibility of him taking a position in that part of the state. Bill asked if the wind was blowing in eastern Kansas that day and was told no, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, and the birds were singing. 
   Bill looked out his window in Garden City, couldn't see across the street for all the dust, and at that moment the decision was made to move the Neal family across the state to settle in Altamont, which has remained the Neal home ever since. 
   Always quick to adopt the local community spirit, Bill for a time taught Sunday School at the Altamont Presbyterian Church to high school-age and young adults. He even held briefly the position there as Assistant Sunday School Superintendent. One Sunday both the Superintendent and the pianist were gone leaving Bill fully in charge. 
   He arranged for a substitute pianist and all seemed to be going well. When someone in the class suggested a particular hymn, Bill joined in with enthusiasm, but didn't notice that his hymnal was missing a page and he was singing a different song. Not long after that, Bill decided to pass on the role of Assistant Superintendent to another. 
   All of us, in our own way, have our own cherished memories and stories of Bill Neal. Some of the remembrances of his former coworkers and friends include those of Jim Cerne, who described Bill as simply, ``his mentor''. Also, Paul Schmidt, former Cherokee County Farm Bureau Agent, recalls the time his wife was concerned about his health and was pressing him to get a check-up at a clinic in Ft. Scott. Bill thought the best way to get Paul to see a doctor was to agree to see one as well. He told Paul, if you go, I will go along with you for the same treatment, and it worked. Although they were tempted to sidetrack their trip from Ft. Scott to a Missouri golf course, they did get the check-up. However, the results were a little unexpected. 
   Paul got a clear bill of health and Bill ended up getting gall bladder surgery. 
   Slick Norris, while the Altamont Grade School Principal, learned of Bill's former achievements in field and track and one day asked him to give a demonstration to the students on pole vaulting. Young Billy Neal was quite proud when his ``old dad'' was able to top 8 feet in prime form at the age of 39. 
   Bill's love of history was well known. Billy and others often noted how Bill always managed to land on ``yellow'' in Trivial Pursuit. But beyond that, Bill was a serious student of history and served well as the family genealogist. In fact, on a recent trip to Illinois and Indiana, he uncovered some interesting and long-forgotten tales of his mother's ancestors. 
   For others of us there are differing impressions. Grandchildren will be quick to remember their grandpa's booming voice and hearty laughter. And, it will be easy to imagine Bill still making the rounds at the Parsons Country Club. 
   Honesty was a standard Bill lived by every day of his life. On a recent tour of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bill promptly provided the full suggested donation price posted on a museum table, even after a local artist informed him it was just fine to offer only 50 cents. 
   Similarly, during a tour of a Mexican border town, Bill was walking down the street and came upon a young woman selling tablecloths on a display. He asked her the price and she said $7. When he asked her for a sack to put them in, she misunderstood and said, $6. Anyway, Bill was never one to dicker. 
   But, maybe, it was his never-failing optimism that was Bill Neal's greatest calling card. To him, every morning was a ``glorious good morning'' and every day brought his greeting of a most deliberate ``rise and shine''! 
   Aside from family and friends, though, it was perhaps the U.S. Marine  Corps and his experience during the war years that best shaped the qualities and character of Bill Neal. For many veterans, the horrible experiences of war are not the subject of comfortable conversation, and such was the case with Bill. Not until 1992 would Bill discuss many of his war experiences with even members of his immediate family. 
   In 1992, Bill and Natalie attended the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the 3rd Marine Division in San Diego. That event, coupled with his reunion of old friends and sojourners of harms way, served as an invitation for Bill to release many of the memories he had held for half a century. He began to open up and talk about those years and let us all share in the pride of what he and others did for his country and for us. 
   Nearly every year since then, Bill and Natalie attended these annual reunions where ``Semper Fidelis'' is demonstrated in a big way. In July 1994, Bill and Natalie participated in a charter flight where a large contingent of former fellow Marines, and their families, returned to Guam for the 50th Anniversary of the American landing on those shores. 
   As they approached the island, the pilot slowly circled the beaches below where in 1944, Bill and his comrades slogged ashore toward a hostile enemy and an uncertain fate. Its not hard to imagine the rush of emotions everyone aboard that plane experienced either remembering or imagining what it had been like. Once on the ground, the people of Guam came out to cheer the return of the liberators who marched onto their shores all those years ago and where every year since, July 21st is celebrated as ``liberation day''. 
   While the image of hero is real, it is not necessarily as a liberator, a warrior, or even as the recipient of the Purple Heart that we recall in the person of Bill Neal. Instead, it is of a loving husband and father. The relationship shared by Bill and Natalie for more than 50 years has been more than a model marriage. It is unlikely there has ever been another couple more dedicated to each other, more in tune with each other, and more deeply in love with each other than Bill and Natalie. 
   Bill and Natalie have given us two extremely intelligent and talented children, 8 grandchildren, and 2 great grandchildren, so far. Other surviors include two brother, Cecil Neal of Oregon, Wisconsin and Willis Neal of Overland Park, Kansas; five sisters, Glenna Schneider of Tribune, Kansas, Twyla Miller of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Sally Hager of Dighton, Kansas, Phyllis Luerman of Hoisington, Kansas, and Penny McClung of Attica, Kansas. Bill was preceded in death by a sister, Jessie Kasselman. 
   In many ways, Bill Neal lived the American dream. Rising from humble origins in the still untamed plains of western Kansas, he went on to accomplish a challenging career, marry a lovely and talented woman, and produce loving and dedicated children. He offered everything, including his very life, in the protection of those things most important. He met the challenge of his generation when foreign oppression threatened our very way of life. He came to adopt and live by the creed of his fellow Marines, the one which it is not now too difficult to imagine him using to salute those most dear to him.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment which I am cosponsoring with my colleague from Pennsylvania. As you know, this amendment will allow Amtrak to continue leasing vehicles from GSA through 2003. We are all eager to see Amtrak continue progressing toward self-sufficiency. Without this amendment, we will be jeopardizing their ability to achieve that goal. 
   In my own State, half a million people from Wisconsin ride Amtrak every year. It is very important not only to Wisconsin but to every State that Amtrak continue its progress toward viability. We must continue to allow Amtrak to transition to self-sufficiency by 2003. 
   This amendment is very crucial to that effort. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator COCHRAN, my chairman, and his fine staff for the efficient completion of S. 2536. My friend from Mississippi has conducted this debate--as he always does--in a balanced, fair, and non partisan manner. He is a gentleman and a friend, and it is an honor and a pleasure to work with him. 
   The bill we just passed includes funding for a wide variety of programs important to the American people. This is especially true now due to economic conditions in rural America which have not kept pace with the general prosperity enjoyed by most Americans. 
   The bill also responds quickly and adequately to the very real crisis that has hit the dairy industry across this nation. Last December, milk prices dropped unexpectedly and dramatically. Today, the base price farmers receive for their milk is $9.46. The average base price for 1998 was $14.21, and the average for 1999 was $12.43. 
   Those cold numbers cannot express the hard damage that has been done to dairy farmers and their families throughout my State, and throughout the nation. They add up to families that have stopped milking after generations, and rural towns that are collapsing as farms disappear. America's dairyland is in real danger of becoming a wasteland. 
   And today with this bill, the Senate has responded with emergency payments to the small farmers hardest hit by this disaster. I am proud of this institution for putting aside regional differences and interests, and for seeing this provision as--not just helping Wisconsin farmers, or Vermont farmers, or Pennsylvanian farmers--but as helping American families. 
   I also thank the Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for his vital assistance in securing these emergency dairy payments. At the end of last year, when we spent a great deal of the Senate's time on dairy issues, he listened to me and to the unique struggles of Wisconsin dairy farmers. He said then he would do whatever he could to help. And he has. He is a man who speaks some of the most inspiring and powerful words spoken on the Senate floor--and he is a man of those words. It is an honor to serve with him. 
   This is a good bill and, again, we should all congratulate Senator COCHRAN for his fine leadership of our subcommittee. I also want to thank the members of my staff who have helped make this process run as smoothly as it has this year: Paul Bock, my chief of staff, and Ben Miller, who is new on my staff this year, have done a fine job. Special thanks goes to the subcommittee's minority clerk, Galen Fountain, without whom I do not believe there could be an Agriculture bill in the Senate. His knowledge of the subject, his patience, his loyalty, and his work ethic are legendary around here, and deservedly so. 
   I look forward to moving this bill through conference quickly, and having a solid Agriculture budget in place well before October 1st. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss my opposition to this legislation repealing the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents. 
   The rising gas prices of this past spring and summer have been a great concern to many of us across the country, and nowhere has the burden been greater than in my State of Wisconsin where gas prices at some locations peaked over $2.00 per gallon. Families and businesses have been hard hit by this unexpected strain on their budgets. Everyday activities of work and recreation and summer travel plans have been altered. Fortunately, prices have begun to decline, and we are hopeful that that trend will only continue in the approaching months. This decline is in no small part the result of the bipartisan efforts of our Congressional delegation to provide relief to our constituents. With many forces at play, we worked strenuously to get to the root of the rising gas price problem. 
   First, we requested an EPA waiver from the reformulated gas requirements, which many considered to be a minor, yet still contributing, factor to the price increases. We also took the oil companies to task for gouging the consumer at the pump, while enjoying huge increases in profits. We called for a Federal Trade Commission investigation into the causes of spiking prices in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest and now await the preliminary report. Lastly, we have attacked the main cause of the problem--the coordinated underproduction of oil on the part of OPEC, the organization of oil-producing nations. Fortunately, under pressure from Congress and the Administration, the OPEC nations have agreed to increase their oil output. All these efforts taken together have yielded positive results, with prices dropping by 30 to 40 cents, and certainly we will continue to be vigilant to ensure this trend continues. 
   Clearly I am very sympathetic to the amendment sponsor's stated goals of providing relief at the pump. But I am convinced that repealing the gas tax is the wrong way to achieve this important goal. Repealing the tax will drastically reduce the funds available for critically needed highway safety and maintenance programs, jeopardizing highway safety and putting other local services at risk by creating budget shortfalls. Moreover, repealing the tax does not guarantee that prices will go down for consumers. In fact, there is a strong likelihood that repealing the gas tax would only deliver more profits to the oil companies without delivering any relief to the consumer. 
   With the TEA-21 highway bill, we worked hard to guarantee that gas tax revenues would go to states for infrastructure improvements and to make the distribution of those monies fair for Wisconsin. We went from a 92 percent to 99 percent return on the dollar for Wisconsin, and those funds are desperately needed for road, bridge and transit improvements. It would be disastrous to lose transportation money just as Wisconsin, with our short construction season, is poised to start a number of road improvement and expansion projects.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of the FY 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Although I have concerns with the funding levels in some areas, I want to commend Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN for again working under difficult budget constraints to put together a good bill that addresses many of our nation's needs. 
   I am pleased that the bill includes significant increases for many vital  health and education programs. We've invested in our youngest children, by increasing the Child Care & Development Block Grant by $817 million, and by increasing Head Start by $1 billion. The bill also provides much-needed increases for elementary and secondary education, including Title I, Special Education, After-School programs, and Impact Aid. And the bill ensures that more students will have the opportunity to go to college by increasing funding for Pell Grants, Work-Study, and TRIO programs. It is my hope that when we go to conference, we can find more funds to make an even stronger investment in our children's education. 
   I am also pleased that the bill makes great strides in ensuring access to quality health care. The bill includes a $150 million increase for Community Health Centers, which provide care to many low-income, uninsured Americans. The bill includes a modest increase for nursing home inspections to ensure that elderly and disabled patients receive the highest quality care. And clearly, all Americans will benefit from the $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. This increase in funding for biomedical research will lead us down the path to new treatments and cures for disease. 
   Despite these important provisions, I have several concerns with the bill that I believe must be addressed in conference. First, I am deeply troubled by the cut in the Social Services Block Grant. My State and counties rely on these funds to provide home care, services for the disabled, and child welfare programs. In Wisconsin, the vast majority of SSBG money goes straight to the county level. Without SSBG funds, our counties have no guarantee they will receive enough money to provide these critical services. I am heartened that Senator STEVENS, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has made a commitment to restore these funds in conference, and I look forward to working with him to make that happen. 
   Second, I believe we must make a stronger investment in programs that serve our nation's seniors. I am very concerned that programs under the Older Americans Act--including Supportive Services and Centers and Nutrition programs--are inadequately funded. I also support the inclusion of $125 million for the Family Caregiver Support Network, which provides support and respite to family members caring for a relative in long-term care. In addition, we must include larger increases for programs that utilize the unique talents of our nation's older citizens, such as the Foster Grandparents and Senior Companions programs. I hope that the conference committee will do what's right and make the necessary investments in programs that serve the elderly. 
   Finally, I was also disappointed that a provision blocking OSHA from pursuing a rule on ergonomics was included in the bill. This move to include legislative riders on appropriations bills has become a common effort to circumvent the rule making process. In this case, opponents wanted to stop the process before we had a chance to see what the final rule would look like. I believe this effort to halt the rule is premature. There are almost 1.8 million ergonomic injuries every year with 300,000 resulting in lost work days. Workers are suffering through painful injuries every day, and we must do something. OSHA has been working on this issue for ten years, and we should delay it no longer. 
   Overall, Mr. President, I believe the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee have done an outstanding job in putting together this bill under difficult circumstances. I am voting for the bill at this point, despite the concerns I have just outlined, because I believe we must move this bill through the Appropriations process. However, let me make clear that these concerns must be addressed before the bill emerges from Conference. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to improve the bill as the process continues.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hutchison amendment, which would allow local school districts to use Title VI funds to establish same-gender schools if they so choose. I have opposed a similar amendment in the past because I have been concerned that many of these ``separate but equal'' programs are sometimes not equal in reality. I am pleased that the Senator from Texas has made modifications to her amendment that deal with these concerns, and ensures that single-gender schools will not result in a system where one gender is educationally disadvantaged. 
   I believe this amendment is another important step in our drive toward more flexibility and local control in education. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention and Responsibility Act--better known as ``Three R's''--which would also provide school districts with the flexibility to design programs that best meets their needs. The Hutchison amendment, which allows local officials to make the decision to set up a single-gender school, is consistent with the ``Three R's'' philosophy. We must continue to move toward a public education system that gives States and local school districts--who are in the best position to know what their educational needs are--the ability to create innovative programs that allow all students to achieve to high standards.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have all watched in the last few weeks as gas prices have skyrocketed across the country, reaching an average price for regular gas of $ 1.68 per gallon. The situation is even worse in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on June 21 that the average price in Milwaukee for regular gas has reached $2.05 per gallon, and reports of consumers paying as much as $2.30 or more are not uncommon. We need to take action, and take action now, to combat this unjustified rise in gas prices that takes hard-earned dollars away from average citizens every time they visit the gas pump. It is for this reason that I rise today, with my colleagues Senators DEWINE, SPECTER, LEAHY, and GRASSLEY, to introduce the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2000'', ``NOPEC''. 
   We have all heard many explanations offered for this rise in gas prices. Some say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some blame disruptions in supply. Others point to the EPA requirement mandating use of a new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas in the Midwest. Some even claim that refiners and distributors are illegally fixing prices, and I am glad to see that the Federal Trade Commission, at the request of the Wisconsin delegation and Senator DEWINE, has now launched an investigation to figure out if these allegations are true. And these are just a few of the reasons that have been offered. 
   But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable. This is the price fixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations, a conspiracy that for years has unfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC but, sadly, until now no one has tried to take any action to put it out of business. NOPEC will, for the first time, establish, clearly and plainly, that when a group of competing oil producers like OPEC agrees to act together to restrict supply or set prices they are violating U.S. law, and it will authorize the Attorney General or FTC to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our bill will also make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind the doctrines of ``Sovereign Immunity'' or ``Act of State'' to escape the reach of American justice. 
   Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the international oil cartel would be in gross violation of our most basic principles of antitrust law as nothing more than an illegal price fixing scheme if this cartel was a group of international private companies rather than foreign governments. But OPEC members have used the shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape accountability for their price-fixing. The Federal Sovereign Immunities Act, though, already recognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of nations is not protected by sovereign immunity. And it is hard to imagine an activity that is more obviously commercial than selling oil for profit, as the OPEC nations do. Our legislation will correct one erroneous twenty-year-old lower federal court holding and establish that sovereign immunity doctrine will not divest a U.S. court from jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel are violating antitrust law. 
   Mr. President, in recent years a consensus has developed in international law that certain basic standards are universal, and that the international community can, and should, take action when a nation violates these fundamental standards. The response of the international community to ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and action by the courts of Britain to recognize that Mr. Pinochet could be held accountable in Britain for allegations of human rights abuses and torture that occurred when he was President of Chile are two prominent examples. The rogue actions of the international oil cartel should be treated no differently. The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors cannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. This principle is the foundation upon which the entire body of competition law rests. In this era of increasing globalization, when we truly need to open international markets to ensure the prosperity of all, we should not permit any nation to flout this fundamental principle. 
   Our NOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our authorities to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing conspiracy of the oil cartel and will, at a minimum, have a real deterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices to the detriment of consumers. For these reasons, I urge that my colleagues support this bill so that our nation will finally have an effective means to combat this selfish conspiracy of oil-rich nations.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the Child Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act, with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator CHAFEE, as well as Senators GRAHAM and LINCOLN. This legislation is designed to increase child support collections across the country by allowing more parents to secure overdue support payments through the tax refund offset program. 
   Child support enforcement is an issue that I care a great deal about. Every day, far too many children in this country go without the resources they need to learn and grow in healthy, nurturing environments. Working to improve the lives and futures of these children in need should count amount our highest priorities, and we can do just that by improving our system of child support enforcement. 
   This legislation that we are introducing today proposes one such improvement by seeking to expand the use of an important enforcement tool. As my colleagues may know, under current law, custodial parents are eligible to use the tax refund offset program if their child support cases involve minors, adult disabled children, or parents on public assistance. The offset program has played a key role in securing overdue support payments. In fact, along with wage withholding, the offset program counts as one of the most effective tools that custodial parents owed support have at their disposal. For the 1998 tax year, the federal government collected a record $1.3 billion in overdue support through the tax offset program, an 18 percent increase over the previous year and a 99 percent increase since 1992. These collections yielded benefits to approximately 1.4 million families. 
   Yet despite these admirable gains, under current law, the benefits of the tax refund offset program are not available to other custodial parents, those who have adult children, who are rightfully owed past-due support. Our legislation would address this issue by allowing all parents who are owed overdue court-ordered support to be eligible for the offset program, regardless of whether their child is disabled or a minor. We believe that this straightforward change will both increase child support collections and help ease the burdens of many custodial parents. It will assist those parents who may have worked multiple jobs and struggled to provide for their children but who may still have difficulty recovering child support debt owed to them without the assistance of the offset program. 
   Our Nation's unacceptably low rate of child support enforcement is a national crisis. Our public system collects only 23 percent of its caseload, and over $47 billion in overdue support is owed to our nation's children. Clearly, we must do all we can to address this very serious problem. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with Senators Chafee, Graham, Lincoln, and myself is supporting this important legislation. It will expand one effective tool in the enforcement arsenal and help increase the resources available to families in need.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I just wanted to briefly comment on this year's Defense bill, and my decision to support it. Last year I came to the floor and was forced to oppose the bill after the Budget Committee engaged in some accounting hijinks in order to squeeze an extra $7 billion into the Defense budget. Even though the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would exceed the Budget Resolution, the Budget Committee used an accounting gimmick to get around the rules. Budget gimmicks do more damage than just allowing the Congress to engage in irresponsible spending. Gimmicks delude the American people, and destroy their faith in the process. 
   Last year we crowed loudly about the savings in the Budget Resolution, and then quietly added extra money back into the budget all year long. One of the biggest offenders was the Defense Appropriations bill. 
   This year, however, things are different. While I did not support the Budget Resolution, at least this year the Defense bill is abiding by the level set out in the Resolution. At least this year we are being honest about how much will be spent on Defense. There are no gimmicks, no smoke and mirrors. I applaud Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE for their efforts this year to stay within their budget allocation. It was not easy, it never is, but they were successful. 
   The bill before us is still three billion dollars above the President's request, but I reluctantly support the bill. It is a more responsible bill than years past. Not only do we strengthen our commitment to our soldiers and their family through improvements in the housing allowance and a 3.7 percent pay increase, but we also face up to our overseas commitments. For the first time Congress and the Department of Defense have included funding, roughly $4.2 billion, for our operations in Iraq and Bosnia. Next year we will not be called on to furnish emergency funding for an operation that is not a surprise, not unplanned, and while dangerous, it is not an emergency. I am pleased that we are including these funds in the bill. 
   Like all my colleagues, I am very concerned about how much we spend on our defense and where we spend it. I believe that the greatest assets funded in the Defense budget are our people, and that we need to do more to let them know how much their country values them. This bill moves in that direction, and it does that in an honest and aboveboard manner.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today and join my colleague Senator RICK SANTORUM of Pennsylvania to introduce legislation to provide much needed assistance to our nation's dairy producers who are facing the lowest milk prices in over two decades. 
   Due to the failure of the federal order reform process and the Administration's failure to include a meaningful dairy price safety net in its Fiscal Year 2001 budget, this legislation is an appropriate and necessary response to the ongoing regional milk pricing inequities and the dairy income crisis affecting all producers. In the past, the divisive and controversial dairy compact system has hindered Congress's efforts to achieve a fair and equitable national dairy policy. I am pleased to join with Senator SANTORUM to introduce this legislation to create a regionally equitable plan will provide a price safety net for small and medium sized dairy producers throughout the country. 
   The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act of 2000 has two major goals: (1) to create a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all regions of the country; (2) provide stability for dairy producers in the prices they receive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this legislation creates a price safety net for farmers by providing supplemental income payments when milk prices are low. A ``sliding-scale'' payment is made based upon the previous year's price for the national average for Class III milk. In essence, the payment rate to farmers is highest when the national Class III average is the lowest. To participate in this program, a farmer must have produced milk for commercial sale in the previous year. Payments under the program are also capped for the first 26,000 hundredweight of production. Again, all dairy producers would be eligible to participate under this scenario. 
   The fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill includes $443 million in emergency direct payments to dairy producers for losses incurred this year. While this action is absolutely necessary to respond to the current crisis, it is time that an on-going program providing supplemental income payments to farmers when milk prices decline be established. This important legislation represents a bipartisan and national approach in providing predictability and price stability in this otherwise volatile industry. Again, I am pleased to join with Senator SANTORUM in introducing this legislation and look forward to working with him in passing this important legislation.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report on the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. Farmers in Wisconsin and all across the country need improved risk management products to  help them guard against adverse weather and market conditions. I also want to express my thanks to Chairman LUGAR, Senator HARKIN, and other members of the Agriculture Committee for including in this conference report expansion of a dairy options pilot program that will help dairy farmers achieve similar levels of protection afforded other agricultural producers. 
   I also want to mention the fact that this conference report includes $7.1 billion in additional assistance to farmers and ranchers this year and in 2001. This level of spending was made possible due to a budget reserve included in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution which provided an additional $5.5 billion in mandatory spending to the Agriculture Committee in fiscal year 2000 and an additional $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2001. The budget resolution specified that these funds were to be made available to assistance producers of program and special crops. Senator DOMENICI, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, made reference to the action taken by both the Budget and Agriculture Committees in providing for this budgeted approach to meeting the needs of America's farmers. 
   I want to take this opportunity to mention additional assistance for farmers provided in the pending Agriculture appropriations bill which includes, among other items, emergency spending for America's dairy farmers. Senators will note that within the additional $7.1 billion included in the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, no funds are provided for dairy farmers who are now suffering from the greatest price collapse in history. Dairy farmers in Wisconsin, in Vermont, in the South, in the West, in all parts of the nation are suffering terribly from this dire emergency and it is proper that the Congress take action, as we have, to meet this situation. 
   I mention this in order to remind my colleagues that we will shortly be considering the Agriculture appropriations bill on the Senate Floor and I ask for the support of all Senators in our efforts to help America's dairy farmers. I would also note that to those who may be confusing the funding provided in our bill with the amount provided in the budget resolution, that dairy producers were not included in the description of agricultural producers to receive assistance though the agricultural budget reserve directed to the authorizing committee. The emergency funding for dairy farmers is separate from the actions taken in the bill now before the Senate, is indeed an emergency, and the action taken by the Appropriations Committee in this regard is proper and must go forward.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about confirming Bradley Smith to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission or the FEC. The FEC is an independent regulatory agency entrusted with administering and enforcing the Nation's campaign finance laws. Yet, Bradley Smith believes that the very campaign finance laws he would be required to administer and enforce should be thrown out. 
   I am not questioning the integrity of this nominee or his fitness for government service in general. I also believe we must be careful not to reject nominees just because we object to their views. However, when a person like Bradley Smith is put forward, a person whose views seem to undermine the very purpose for which he is being nominated, I believe we have a responsibility to speak out. Bradley Smith is not an appropriate choice for FEC commissioner and I will be voting against this nomination.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Mary McLaughlin to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Those of us on the Judiciary Committee know Ms. McLaughlin from her outstanding work as Special Counsel for our Terrorism Subcommittee during the Ruby Ridge investigation in 1995. During those hearings, Ms. McLaughlin demonstrated precisely the qualities we want in a federal judge--she is intelligent, fair-minded, tough, possesses a judicial temperament, and is deeply committed to the cause of justice. Once we put her on the bench, she is going to be a terrific federal judge. 
   Our Ruby Ridge subcommittee ran the ideological gamut. Yet Ms. McLaughlin gained the respect and admiration of all of our colleagues from both parties who worked with her--Senators SPECTER, THOMPSON, ABRAHAM, THURMOND, LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, GRASSLEY, and CRAIG--for the skill and professionalism she brought to her work. Let me make special mention of how tough and persistent Ms. McLaughlin was when the Justice Department was ``less than enthusiastic'' about supplying us with documents. Largely as a result of her efforts, we obtained the information that we needed, and our investigation went on to become a true model of bipartisan cooperation. 
   Beyond her service to the U.S. Senate, Ms. McLaughlin has stellar credentials for a judgeship. She is a senior partner in the leading Philadelphia law firm of Dechert, Price and Rhoads, where her practice has concentrated in a myriad of complex litigation matters. She was a recipient of a 1998 ``Women of Distinction'' Award from the Philadelphia Business Journal, the National Association of Women Business Owners, and The Forum of Executive Women. Her career has also included teaching at the law schools of Vanderbilt University, the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University. In addition, Ms. McLaughlin served for four years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia where, Mr. President, she put criminals behind bars. Not surprisingly, given this stellar record, she was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association. 
   Unfortunately, a few outside groups have raised questions about her candidacy based on a small portion of Ms. McLaughlin's pro bono work. While it is true that she is a person of strong convictions, none is stronger than her dedication to the Rule of Law. In other words, I am confident that she will in all cases apply the law, not make it. 
   I wouldn't say that about everybody who has been nominated for a federal judgeship in recent years. 
   Mr. President, Ms. McLaughlin deserves the type of strong, bipartisan support from the entire Senate that she has already obtained from those of us who worked with her on Ruby Ridge. ``There's something about Mary's'' record of distinguished public service, her professional experience, her legal talents, and her personal integrity that will make her an outstanding Judge on the Eastern District bench. I urge my colleagues to swiftly confirm her.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of 40 years of outstanding reporting by my friend, Frank Aukofer, who is retiring from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel next week. With his retirement, the Capitol loses one of its finest journalists and Wisconsin loses one of its keenest eyes on Washington. I lose a reporter I admire and trust. 
   Frank is regarded as among the best in his profession, by both his peers and by those he covers. He is respected as a straight-shooter, valued for his integrity and admired as an honorable man. As a journalist, he has reported on virtually every event of consequence in our country over more than three decades. He has an impressive working knowledge of Congress, of policy, and of politics. Frank is usually three steps ahead of the story. 
   He is a journalist who didn't lose sight of the responsibilities of reporting, a professional who is a credit to his occupation. 
   Frank's love of his profession is evident in his long reach beyond the newspaper. He will be honored later this month by the Freedom Forum, a foundation dedicated to free press and free speech throughout the world. He is recognized as a national expert on the media, and has testified before Congress to promote access to government information. He was a visiting professor at Vanderbilt University. He was an early and strong supporter of the Newseum, our country's premier news museum. 
   Frank is also an active member and former President of the National Press Club, and an enthusiastic, if not particularly gifted, performer for the Gridiron Club. Earning the envy of his colleagues and sports car enthusiasts everywhere, Frank has even managed to peddle a legitimate weekly auto column to newspapers around the country. 
   As Frank closes this chapter of his career, I know he looks forward to new adventures and more time to spend with his grandkids. Frank has many more years of ideas and ambitions ahead of him. While I am saddened by his departure from the Capitol, I'm convinced that no one will enjoy a busier retirement than Frank Aukofer. I wish him well, I wish him continued good health, and I will miss him.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to support the long overdue confirmation of Tim Dyk to the Federal Circuit. The Judiciary Committee reported out Mr. Dyk in 1998 by an overwhelming, bipartisan margin. Unfortunately, Mr. Dyk's nomination died a slow death last Congress, as he waited in vain for confirmation by unanimous consent or, in the alternative, at least a floor vote. 
   This Congress, Mr. Dyk has had wait yet another year and a half for Senate consideration after his renomination and second overwhelming Judiciary Committee approval. This delay has been unfair to Mr. Dyk and his family, who have had to put their lives on hold as he awaits confirmation. It has also been unfair to the Federal Circuit, which will be enormously enhanced by his ascension. We are lucky Mr. Dyk was willing to wait; other outstanding candidates, however, may be dissuaded from making the already arduous sacrifices necessary to serve in the federal judiciary. 
   Finally, it now appears that Mr. Dyk is reaching the end of his long road to  confirmation and will soon take his deserved seat on the bench. He is an excellent candidate--a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren on the Supreme Court, and a litigator with a long, distinguished practice and a history of public service. 
   I strongly support this nominee and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Thank you Chairman HATCH for your kind words and all your help and the help of your staff in moving this important legislation forward. Thank you as well to my fellow Senator from Wisconsin and Senators WELLSTONE and GRAMS from Minnesota. I am pleased that we were able to work together to reach a compromise and help give the Hmong veterans and their families the chance to become citizens. The Hmong community, particularly the Lao Veterans of America, have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point. As my colleagues have mentioned, no negative inference should be drawn from the compromise language. Last week, I was proud to participate in the Lao Veterans of America National Recognition Ceremonies with so many Hmong veterans from Wisconsin. With this bill, we are attempting to repay them for their tremendous sacrifices and courage. I hope that we can achieve the final steps and send this bill to the President's desk for signature as soon as possible.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this week I join people in Wisconsin and across the nation in celebrating Taiwanese-American Heritage Week. This week of celebration, from May 7 to May 14, honors the many diverse contributions of over 500,000 Taiwanese-Americans in the  United States. These Americans have contributed significantly to our social fabric, making notable contributions as medical professionals, Nobel Laureate scientists, business owners, human rights activists, and teachers. 
   While it is important to recognize the achievements of Taiwanese-Americans in the United States, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week also gives us the opportunity to celebrate the success of democracy in Taiwan. Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, Taiwan has made consistent strides toward becoming an open, democratic society where freedoms are respected and the will of the people is observed. To the credit of the many Taiwanese-Americans who fought to bring democratic principles back to the island, Taiwan is now a vibrant democratic member of the international community. 
   With the recent election of opposition leader Chen Shui-bian as President, Taiwan has again reaffirmed its commitment to the open electoral process that is the cornerstone of democracy. While this election bodes well for the future of a democratic Taiwan, many challenges remain. Taiwan must continue to resist internal anti-democratic forces, while also providing for its own security in a region with too few democratic neighbors. However, I am confident that Taiwan will meet these challenges and continue to play a productive role in the international community. 
   Mr. President, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week properly recognizes the longstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. Once again, I commend the accomplishments and on-going contributions of the Taiwanese-American community.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the Lieberman amendment, which is based on our bill ``The Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act of 2000''--better known as ``Three R's.'' I believe that this bill represents a realistic, effective approach to improving public education--where 90% of students are educated. 
   For the past 35 years, when the time has come for the Senate to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it has done so with bipartisan support. However, over the past week, most of what we've seen on the Senate floor has been partisan wrangling--from both sides of the aisle--over how to reform education. I think  that's tragic. Our nation's children deserve a serious debate and real reform--not partisan bickering and election-year gamesmanship. 
   Mr. President, addressing problems in education is going to take more than cosmetic reform. It will require some tough decisions and a willingness to work together. We need to let go of the tired partisan fighting over more spending versus block grants, and take a middle ground approach that will truly help our States, school districts--and most importantly, our students. 
   During the past several weeks, I am pleased to have been part of a bipartisan group of Senators who have put partisan politics aside and are seeking to find such a middle ground. Our group has been working to meld the best parts of all of our plans--in the hope that we can actually get a bill passed this year. In a short period of time, we have made tremendous progress and found more agreement between our two parties than the past week's floor debate has shown. I am hopeful that we will soon reach agreement on a bipartisan compromise, but even if we do not, we have laid the groundwork for the future. At some point, the entire Senate will have to put politics aside and deal with education reform. Our plan can serve as the foundation for that compromise--and I look forward to working with our group to make that happen. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Federal government must continue to be a partner with States, school districts, and educators to improve public education. But it is time to take a fresh look at the structure of Federal education programs--building upon past successes and putting an end to our past failures. 
   The amendment before us now--our ``Three R's'' bill--does just that. Three R's makes raising student achievement for all students--and closing the achievement gap between low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To accomplish this, our bill centers around three principles. 
   First, we believe that we must provide more funding for education--and that Federal dollars must be targeted to disadvantaged students. Federal funds make up only 7% of all money spent on education, so it is essential that we target those funds on the students who need them the most. 
   Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the best position to know what their educational needs are. Three R's gives them more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to best meet those needs. 
   Finally--and I believe this is the lynchpin of our approach--we believe that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must also be accountability for results. These principles are a pyramid, with accountability being the base that supports the federal government's grant of flexibility and funds. 
   For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to States and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their students. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good job. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are struggling to do a better job. And we must stop subsidizing failure. Our highest priority must be educating children--not perpetuating broken systems. 
   Mr. President, the ``Three R's bill takes a fresh look at public education. I believe it represents a real middle ground, building upon all the progress we've made and tackling the problems we still face. This bill--by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility--and most importantly, accountability--demonstrates how we can work with our State and local partners to make sure every child receives the highest quality education--and a chance to live a successful, productive life. I urge my colleagues to support the Lieberman-Bayh amendment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from Wisconsin in introducing this legislation to honor the memory of Les Aspiin. Long before I entered politics, Les Aspin was a good friend of mine. I had the good fortune to serve with Les Aspin in Congress and to work with him when he served as Secretary of Defense. Les Aspin was truly dedicated to public service. He was genuinely challenged by the policy making process, and he was not hesitant in bringing his great intellectual gifts to bear on the problems of our time. He was a master of the Sunday morning talk shows, expounding on the issues of the day with his trenchant analyses. As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin was one of the most influential voices on U.S. defense policy. 
   His ascension to the chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee was not without rancor, but even those who disagreed with Les respected his verve and determination. 
   When we lost Les Aspin, we lost a man of great vision. He was one of the few who realized that we needed a completely new way of thinking about national security policy in the post-cold-war era. He had the capacity to think through the difficult issues involved in developing such a policy. And, he was unrelenting in making us deal with those issues. 
   Even though Les Aspin became a powerful national figure, he never forgot his roots. Les represented the 1st Congressional District for 22 years and he cared deeply about the people of his district. He was aggressive in pursuing projects that would benefit the people of Wisconsin and he left no stone unturned in helping resolve constituent problems. He especially recognized the importance of reliable postal service in small and big towns alike. He was known to become personally involved in responding to complaints from constituents about postal service, often attending meetings across the district on postal issues. Les became intimately involved when the Janesville Postal Office was moved from downtown, working to ensure that service was retained for all, especially small businesses and other postal patrons who relied on the downtown post office. Thus, naming the Janesville Post Office after Les Aspin is a most fitting tribute to his many years of service to the people of the First Congressional District. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope for its speedy passage.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend an organization that has provided high quality mental health, residential, case management, prevention, treatment and outreach services to adults, youth and families in the Greater Milwaukee area for thirty years. This organization is the Counseling Center of Milwaukee, Inc. 
   The Counseling Center of Milwaukee came from humble beginnings. Established in 1970 in the basement of Milwaukee's St. Mary's Hospital, it merged with the organization Pathfinders for Runaways in 1971. The Center has since grown into a $2.3 million agency with 100 paid and volunteer staff. 
   In working to fulfill its vision statement of putting more people in charge of their lives, connecting to others and contributing to their communities, the Counseling Center of Milwaukee provides both individual and family services including education, counseling, providing emergency shelter and mentoring. 
   The Counseling Center serves a variety of clients, most of whom are low income and most from the city of Milwaukee. The Counseling Center has always been a place where clients could turn when they had nowhere else to go. Through public and private funding, the Counseling Center provides service to anyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay. This includes more than 7,000 citizens in the Greater Milwaukee area served in 1999. 
   I am proud to join in celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Counseling Center of Milwaukee. I thank the dedicated employees and volunteers of the Center for their significant contributions to the mental health of the citizens of my state, and wish them a prosperous future.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today Senator GREGG and I are introducing legislation, the New Economy Tax Simplification Act, to ask government to step out of the way of the growing Internet economy and take a middle ground approach to taxation of Internet commerce. Our legislation does not stop any one State from forcing Internet companies within its borders to collect the sales taxes collected by any other business within its borders. But it does stop every one of the over 7000 local taxing jurisdictions from imposing every one of their unique rules, regulations, and rates on every business that sells over the Internet or through the mail. 
   We are not here today to ask for special treatment for companies that sell on the Internet. We simply want to make sure that businesses that are tackling the market with 21st century technology are not bled to death by the Byzantine local tax system. 
   All companies--regardless of whether they now sell over the Internet or not--benefit from the economic boom and consumer convenience provided by computer commerce. If you don't sell over the Internet now; you probably buy there. If you don't work for a company whose economic fortune is tied to Internet sales or information, your spouse, child, or neighbor probably does. If you haven't invested in one of these successful Internet businesses, they have probably invested in you: in the charities in your community, in the jobs that are growing our economy everywhere; in the State programs financed by the taxes these companies rightly pay to the States in which they have a physical presence. 
   Our bill provides a clear set of standards for businesses operating across state lines through mail-order sales or the Internet. And--very significantly--it also protects the rights of state and local officials to determine tax policy within their own jurisdictions. 
   Some have called for a complete ban on sales taxes on Internet goods. Still others have claimed that companies should collect sales taxes on all of their products without regard to the point of sale or the state or residence of the consumer. 
   We strike a balance between these two extremes. Just as my Wisconsin constituents should not have to pay local sales taxes for schools and sewers in Texas, Nebraska, or New York; it also makes sense that a Wisconsin business should not be forced to collect taxes to support fire and police protection in the other states. Businesses should collect the sales taxes that support the government services they receive. 
   But the main reason I am here today is to protect against a Federal red tape nightmare that would prevent the very growth that we all wish to promote. There are over 7,000 tax jurisdictions in this country, all with their own tax rates, exemptions, audit requirements and appeals procedures. Requiring compliance with all those jurisdictions would mean learning and complying with 46 sets of rules. Under this scenario, companies would have to file more than 425 tax returns every month. That amounts to approximately 5100 tax returns every year. 
   Internet and mail order companies, as well as traditional main street stores who are developing or using Internet services, serve consumers who like the convenience of phone or Internet shopping or who are unable to leave their homes to shop. They offer  greater convenience and greater choice. And they offer small specialty businesses the chance to grow into successful big businesses. 
   Our bill will allow these vital markets to continue to flourish--free from a tangle of tax red tape. It will also allow state and local officials to continue to collect taxes as they see fit within their own jurisdictions. We believe it strikes the proper balance, and we look forward to convincing our colleagues that it is worthy of their support.

    Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to recognize the contribution of the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council, which provides fair housing enforcement services in the Fox Valley in Northeastern Wisconsin. I applaud the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council's fight to end housing discrimination. It is not only wrong, intolerable and unjust, it's illegal. While we would like to think that housing discrimination is a thing of the past, it still happens. And while we would like to think that in this day and age, equal housing opportunities are available to everyone, too many people are still shut out of the right to live in a home of their choosing. The more frequently citizens are reminded of their rights, the more likely they are to seek justice. 
   The North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council's greatest accomplishment has been an ongoing enforcement program. As of March 1, there have been 906 fair housing complaints filed with the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council. Every year since 1992 there has been a major pattern and practice study conducted by the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council. Through national competition, the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council has been the primary contractor on three Fair Housing Initiative Program grants. 
   The North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council has been at the forefront of innovative ways to combat illegal housing discrimination. In 1997 the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council received a Fair Housing Initiative Program Grant which provided the financial resources to increase attention to complaints from four targeted populations: Hmong, Native Americans, Hispanics and persons with disabilities. The North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council developed an Enforcement Network Program with eight advocacy agencies representing those groups. The goals were to develop better communication with the agencies so they would understand how fair housing issues impacted their agencies and clients. Relationships with the agencies were enhanced and more efficient services were provided to the clients. 
   Fair Housing is a right for all Americans, and I commend the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council for their efforts.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. The budget before us allots to tax cuts any extra surplus forecast by CBO this summer. Our amendment strikes that section and saves the extra surplus for debt reduction. That is good for the economy and good for the solvency of Social Security. 
   There are $150 billion for tax cuts and $19 billion for debt reduction in this budget. Our amendment does not change that. It just says that--if we end up with extra money this summer--it ought to go to the debt reduction side of the equation. 
   Some have argued that the extra surplus go to tax cuts because otherwise Congress will spend it. That argument is a straw man. Under the budget as it stands, there is a point of order against spending the extra surplus on anything except tax cuts. Under the budget as we would amend it, there is a point of order against spending the extra surplus on anything. It has to be saved for debt relief.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th Anniversary of the Oshkosh Seniors Center. Since its beginnings in a single room at the First Presbyterian Church in 1975, the Oshkosh Seniors Center has grown to occupy the present site at 200 North Campbell Road. 
   Friends of the Oshkosh Seniors Center were crucial to the success of raising $500,000 of the $1.2 million needed to build the beautiful facility on Campbell Road. The Friends of the Center, on behalf of the City of Oshkosh, worked unfailingly to realize what has become a first class center for senior citizens. They remain committed to meeting the demands of the continuing growth of the Center. Just as the dedication of the Friends of the Center has remained steadfast, the staff and volunteers of the Oshkosh Seniors Center have never wavered from its stated mission in 1975 ``to become a multi-purpose seniors center.'' 
   The center meets the social, physical and emotional needs of senior citizens in the Oshkosh community by providing inter-generational, social, recreational, cultural and volunteer opportunities. These goals are supported by more than one hundred programs and activities in arts and crafts, fine arts, continuing education, games and recreation, community services, support groups, health and wellness, and other events. These offerings have been delivered at the center and at several locations in the area to thousands of people during the past year. 
   It is through the efforts of the center's Director, Sue Kreibich, staff members and countless volunteers who work diligently to make certain the Oshkosh Seniors Center continues to offer opportunities that allows senior citizens of the Oshkosh community to remain active and involved. 
   The center will observe its twenty-fifth anniversary during the week of April 2nd by announcing the inauguration of the Oshkosh Seniors Center Endowment Fund. This Fund will allow the organization to meet the needs of expansion to accommodate the substantial growth that continues at the  center. It is organizations like the Oshkosh Seniors Center and their friends that make Oshkosh a stronger community. 
   Congratulations to the Oshkosh Seniors Center on their 25th anniversary.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act of 2000. Enacting this legislation will complete our work on the Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act that we voted into law last fall. Simply put, the LOCAL TV bill is the last piece of the puzzle that will encourage competition to cable in all markets, not just the top 20 or 30 largest urban areas. 
   At the SHVIA Conference just this past year, we tried to tackle how to encourage ``local-into-local'' service into all areas, not just the biggest and most lucrative TV markets. But we only had mixed success. So it made sense to postpone the debate until this year. At the time, I was not entirely comfortable with the precursor of this measure. But I did then and I do now strongly support its goals. Today's package develops an approach that combines incentives and loan guarantees, which will pave the way for ``local-into-local'' service to reach into our rural areas. I am encouraged by the revisions that addressed the concerns of Chairman GRAMM and others. 
   For example, a loan guarantee must be approved by a board comprised of the Treasury Secretary, Federal Reserve Chairman, and the Agriculture Secretary. Such a board is unlikely to sign off on an overly risky proposition. Their review will help ensure fiscal discipline and prevent the taxpayer from being left on the hook for a bad deal. Furthermore, the government will not underwrite the entire amount of the loan. Holding lenders to 20 percent of the amount financed will make them scrutinize a loan application long and hard before they extend credit under this program. 
   Moreover, we still allow market forces to make this program work. The LOCAL TV bill does not favor any particular technology. It is technologically neutral. Therefore, whether it is satellite, cable or an emerging technology, anyone with the entrepreneurial spirit to take on the task of delivering local television signals to remote areas is eligible for the program. By creating this incentive for all to participate, we permit the market to determine who will win a loan guarantee under this law. 
   Hopefully, and most importantly, this bill will help local-into-local get rolled out more ubiquitously to rural markets in Wisconsin around Green Bay, Madison, Eau Claire, and Wausau and to other areas across the country. This is a good thing for consumers and, very simply, that's why I support passage of this measure. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator FEINSTEIN to introduce ``BLAST''--the Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act. The bill offers two complementary approaches to combating gun violence. The first supplies our Nation's police with a new technology to assist them in solving crimes. The second expands ``Project Exile'' to 50 cities, giving federal prosecutors the resources they need to put more felons behind bars. Let me explain how our measure is crucial to the fight against crime. 
   Reducing crime requires a multifaceted approach. While we need tougher controls to keep guns away from kids in this country--including mandating that child safety locks be sold with every new handgun--all of us also recognize that the battle against senseless violence includes prosecuting all criminals to the letter of the law. 
   Mr. President, just as every person has a unique fingerprint, each gun leaves unique markings on discharged bullets and shell casings. Over the past decade, new technology has allowed for the comparison of those ``gun prints'' with bullets found at crime scenes. By keeping a computerized image of each new gun's fingerprint, police can compare the microscopic differences in markings left by each gun until they find a match. Once a match is found, law enforcement can begin tracing that weapon from its original sale to the person who used it to commit the crime. 
   Indeed, ballistics technology, though nascent, is already helping to solve crimes. For example, in June 1997, an Oakland man was shot and killed as he used a public telephone on a street corner. Without any leads or physical evidence other than a bullet casing left by the discharged weapon, police were initially stymied in their search for the killer. 
   A year passed without any progress in the investigation until police made an ordinary arrest of two men for the unlawful possession of a firearm. When the officers test-fired the confiscated gun and ran the image through their ballistics database, they found a match within seconds. The seized gun was the same gun that fired the deadly bullet in the unsolved case the previous year. Police confronted the two men with this evidence, and quickly received a confession to the murder. 
   In another case, police only found 9 millimeter cartridge casings at the scene of a brutal homicide in Milwaukee--there were no other clues. But four months later, when a teenage male was arrested on an unrelated charge, he was found to be in possession of that firearm. Ballistics linked the two cases. Prosecutors successfully prosecuted three adult suspects for the homicide and convicted the teen in juvenile court. 
   Mr. President, since the early 1990's, more than 250 crime labs and law enforcement agencies in over 40 states have been operating independent ballistics systems maintained by either the ATF or the FBI. Together, ATF's Integrated Ballistics Identification System (``IBIS'') and the FBI's DRUGFIRE system have been responsible for linking 5,700 guns to two or more crimes where corroborating evidence was otherwise lacking. 
   My own state of Wisconsin employs the DRUGFIRE system for ballistics testing and has already used it to solve crime and provide authenticating evidence for ongoing criminal investigations. In 1998, the Milwaukee police department alone analyzed almost 600 firearms and over 3200 fired cartridges. Even though Wisconsin's DRUGFIRE has a limited number of guns in its database, ballistics testing helped solve seven homicides, 100 cases where the reckless use of a weapon endangered public safety, and numerous other gun crimes. 
   These statistics are heartening, but they also illustrate the untapped potential of ballistics as a law enforcement weapon. Simply put, ballistics testing is only as good as the number of images in the database. Unfortunately, not enough guns are test fired before they are sold, not enough communities have access to ballistics databases, and not enough information is shared between law enforcement agencies of different jurisdictions. Ironically, even the two primary agencies responsible for investigating gun crimes--the ATF and the FBI--have created ballistics systems that cannot read each others data. Sadly, this significant law enforcement tool is severely underutilized. 
   But that need not be the case. Title I of BLAST makes ballistics a centerpiece of our anti-crime strategy by requiring federal firearms manufacturers and importers to 
   test fire all new firearms and make the ballistics images available to federal law enforcement; requiring federal law enforcement officials to test fire all firearms in their custody; and providing financial support to communities that include ballistics testing as a critical part of their comprehensive anti-crime strategy, building on the model used by ATF in the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. 
   The burden on manufacturers is minimal--we authorize funds to underwrite the cost of testing--and the assistance to law enforcement is considerable. And don't take my word for it, ask the gun manufacturers and the police. Listen to what Paul Januzzo, the vice-president of the gun manufacturer Glock, said last month in reference to ballistics testing, ``our mantra has been that the issue is crime control, not gun control . . . it would be two-faced of us not to want this.'' In their agreement with HUD, Smith & Wesson agreed to perform ballistics testing on all new handguns. And Ben Wilson, the chief of the firearms section at ATF, emphasized the importance of ballistics testing as a investigative device, ``This [ballistics] allows you literally to find a needle in a haystack.'' 
   Our approach is bipartisan as well. The Republican governor of New York, George Pataki, prominently included a similar ballistics measure in his recently introduced anti-crime package. He clearly recognizes, as we do, that the more we can empower law enforcement, the more effectively we can put hard core criminals where they belong--behind bars.  
   To be sure, we are sensitive to the notion that law abiding hunters and sportsmen need to be protected from any misuse of the ballistics database by government. The BLAST bill explicitly prohibits ballistics information from being used for any purpose unless it is necessary for the investigation of a gun crime. 
   Of course, to successfully combat crime, you also need to enhance the arsenal of law enforcement. That is why Title II of BLAST expands the successful ``Project Exile'' program. By authorizing $20 million over four years, BLAST would fund gun prosecutors in 50 cities--prosecutors, who will work in conjunction with state and local authorities, devoted solely to the aggressive enforcement of the federal gun laws. 
   This program already enjoys widespread support--from the industry to leaders on both sides of the political aisle to the National Rifle Association, which has pointed to Project Exile as a model for fighting gun crime. Our hope is to expand the success of EXILE across the country and provide the resources to every city interested in aggressively pursuing gun crimes. Felons will know that if they commit a crime with a gun they will pay the price. 
   Mr. President, the BLAST bill will enhance a revolutionary new technology that helps solve crime while, at the same time, recognizing that new crime solving instruments are worthless unless prosecutors are in place to punish violent offenders to the fullest extent of the law. BLAST is a worthwhile piece of crime control legislation. I hope that the Senate will quickly move to pass it.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, when the Social Security system was established, a retirement test, also referred to as an earnings test, was made part of the criteria for determining an individual's benefits. This criterion was established because Social Security benefits are intended to replace, in part, earnings lost by an individual or family because of retirement, disability, or death. Therefore, benefits are withheld from individuals who show by their substantial earnings from work that they are not in fact ``retired''. 
   What this means today is that recipients aged 62-65 could earn up to $10,080 annually without having their benefits affected, and those between 65-69 could earn up to $17,000 a year. For earnings above these limits, recipients aged 62-65 lose $1 in benefits for each $2 of earnings while those between 65 and 69 lose $1 in benefits for each $3 in earnings. The earnings test does not apply to recipients age 70 and over, and the exempt limits increase each year at the same rate as average wages in the economy. Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 recipients age 65-69 affected by the earnings limit test. 
   Today we are repealing the earnings limit for people between the full retirement age and age 69, giving them the opportunity for increased financial security, and providing an increase in skilled workers during this tight labor market. 
   Removing the earnings limit will provide seniors with greater independence and financial security. Today, too many Americans struggle through their retirement years trying to make ends meet. The steps we take today will allow seniors to work longer, and depend on their savings less, giving them more security into their later years. In our modern workplace it makes no sense to penalize workers for staying in the workforce longer. Congress works hard to encourage people to plan their retirement years thoughtfully, and removing the earnings limit will give working families one more tool for planning their financial future. 
   This move is especially timely in our tight labor market and booming economy. Removing the earnings limit will allow experienced workers to be able to stay in the workforce. I have heard from several business owners in Wisconsin who are desperate for skilled workers in a number of industries. While the long term answer to the skilled worker shortage is increased worker training and education, encouraging older workers to remain in the workforce will certainly help meet the current demand. Proven, experienced, mature workers will help our economy maintain its momentum. 
   We should not feel too jubilant, however, about today's accomplishment. Comprehensive Social Security Reform is still necessary. Today's changes will do nothing to hold off the coming crisis that will begin when we start drawing down the Social Security Trust fund in 2014. Congress needs to deal with this soon, otherwise we are shirking our duty to the American people.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to include dairy in this $6 billion crop insurance bill has been accepted by the bill managers and I thank them for their cooperation. In particular, I want to thank Senators LUGAR, KERREY, ROBERTS, and DASCHLE for their assistance. I look forward to working with them prior to and during conference to ensure my amendment is part of the final bill reported by the conference committee. 
   Dairy farmers have for too long been without any risk management tools to help them manage the risk of milk price volatility. The Dairy Options Pilot Program, authorized by the 1996 farm bill, was set to expire in 2002 and would have reached its 100 county cap at the end this year. If we had allowed that to happen, we would have taken from dairy farmers this important educational risk management program at a time when milk prices have hit their lowest levels in more than two decades. The DOPP program helps farmers pay for the out-of-pocket costs of buying ``put'' options on the commodity exchanges while the pilot is in effect in their county. Equally important, the program requires that farmers participate in an education and training program on the use of the futures market for risk management purposes. 
   My amendment extends the Dairy Options Pilot Program until 2004 and raises the number of counties that can participate to 300. Moreover, the amendment raises the number of counties in each state that can participate from six to 25. This is important to Wisconsin since, at the end of this year, Wisconsin would have hit its county cap as well. 
   The DOPP, on top of forward contracting through their cooperatives or other milk buyers, provides dairy farmers with an additional risk management tool. It is a tool that will be available, under my amendment, to dairy farmers throughout the nation. It is a national program, not a regional program. And I hope my colleagues from other regions will join me in looking for every possible national tool we have to help dairy farmers across the United States. 
   This is, Mr. President--and I cannot stress this enough--only one of the many things we need to do to help dairy farmers struggle through increased dairy market volatility. Dairy farmers in my state are hurting right now. The DOPP, while important, is not the answer to the unacceptably low milk prices. We must do more--much, much more. DOPP, even with my amendment, will still be available to farmers in only 300 counties. 
   That is why I am also seeking $500 million in additional dairy market loss payments to put more money in the pockets of dairy farmers. Farmers nationwide need that help right now and I hope to work to provide that assistance through my role as ranking Democrat on the Agricultural Appropriations subcommittee. 
   I also want to work with my colleagues to craft a national dairy policy that will provide dairy farmers with a meaningful safety net that does not distort markets or provide unfair regional advantages. 
   But I am pleased that S..2251 bill will make this one tool--the DOPP--available to more farmers. It is, Mr. President, the very least we can do. And I thank the managers for working with me to include this amendment in the bill.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act of 2000--better known as ``Three R's.'' I have been pleased to work with the education community in Wisconsin, as well as Senator LIEBERMAN and our other cosponsors, on this important piece of legislation. I believe that this bill represents a realistic, effective approach to improving public education--where 90 percent of students are educated. 
   We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving public education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in place. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores have risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased. 
   In Wisconsin, educators have worked hard to help students achieve. Fourth-graders and eighth-graders are showing continued improvement on State tests in nearly every subject, particularly in science and math. Third-graders are scoring higher on reading tests. Test results show some improvement across all groups, including African American, disabled, and economically disadvantaged groups. 
   Unfortunately, despite all of our best efforts, we still face huge challenges in improving public schools. The most recent TIMSS study of students from 41 different countries found that many American students score far behind those in other countries. In Wisconsin, scores in math, science and writing are  getting better but still need improvement. And test scores of students from low-income families, while showing some improvement, are still too low. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support the notion that the Federal government must continue to be a partner with States and local educators as we strive to improve public schools. As a nation, it is in all of our best interests to ensure that our children receive the best education possible. It is vital to their future success, and the success of our country. 
   However, addressing problems in education is going to take more than cosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the structure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired partisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a middle ground approach that will truly help our States, school districts--and most importantly, our students. 
   Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student achievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap between low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To accomplish this, our bill centers around three principles. 
   First, we believe that we must continue to make a stronger investment in education, and that Federal dollars must be targeted to the neediest students. A recent GAO study found that Federal education dollars are significantly more targeted to poor districts than money spent by States. Although Federal funds make up only 6-7 percent of all money spent on education, it is essential that we target those funds where they are needed the most. 
   Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the best position to know what their educational needs are. They should be given more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to meet those needs. 
   Finally--and I believe this is the key component of our approach--we believe that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must also be accountability for results. These principles are a pyramid, with accountability being the base that supports the federal government's grant of flexibility and funds. 
   For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to States and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their students. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good job. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are struggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure. Our highest priority must be educating children--not perpetuating broken systems. 
   Mr. President, I believe the ``Three R's'' bill is a strong starting point for taking a fresh look at public education. We need to build upon all the progress we've made, and work to address the problems we still face. This bill--by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility--and most importantly, accountability--demonstrates how we can work with our State and local partners to make sure every child receives the highest quality education--a chance to live a successful productive life. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as education groups in my State, as Congress debates ESEA in the coming months.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to help relieve the financial crisis in the dairy industry. 
   Last fall, milk prices took their steepest dive in history and fell to their lowest level in more than two decades. 
   This is particularly devastating for farmers in Wisconsin who milk on average only about 55 cows. These farmers have particularly tight margins and are less able to withstand low milk prices that USDA forecasts will continue through the year. 
   Dairy farmers continue to call my office in despair. Some farmers can't meet their feed bills, even though feed prices remain relatively low. Meanwhile, other input costs, like fuel and interest rates, are rising. Auctions in the countryside return little to farmers who have made the difficult decision to quit dairying; their neighbors can't afford even the insanely discounted prices for equipment. 
   Are the trials facing farmers markedly different than the difficult conditions that other producers have faced over the last several years? No. But what is different is the level of assistance that dairy farmers have received from the federal government relative to other commodities. 
   The dairy price support program costs only about $150 million per year. That stands in contrast to the more than $14 billion spent in AMTA payments and Loan Deficiency Payments provided to other producers last year. 
   Anticipating a price decline in dairy, Congress provided $325 million for dairy market loss payments. Compare that to the $15 billion provided to crop producers over the last two years. While milk producers are happy for the extra help, most have told me that it simply is not enough given. Milk prices fell far lower than anticipated. And now we must do more. 
   On top of this injustice, Midwest dairy farmers, where much of the nation's milk supply is produced, also suffer from lower income resulting from the discriminatory pricing under the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. Last year, Secretary Glickman attempted to restore some fairness to that system by making some modest reforms. But this Congress unjustly overturned those reforms while simultaneously extending the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact--a milk price cartel which protects producers in the Northeast at the expense of consumers and producers outside the cartel. 
   I am going to work to repeal the Northeast Dairy Compact and to restore some common sense to federal milk pricing. I also will work with my colleagues to develop a meaningful and lasting safety net for dairy producers. 
   But, Mr. President, that will take time. And right now, dairy farmers in Wisconsin don't have time. They need relief. 
   So, today I am introducing a bill to provide $500 million in direct income relief payments to dairy farmers throughout the nation. The money is targeted to small scale farms--those least able to withstand these wild price fluctuations. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold, Specter, Grams, Santorum, and SCHUMER on this legislation. Mr. President, I hope to include this funding in the upcoming supplemental appropriations bill. 
   This will put money in the pockets of dairy farmers now, when they most need it. Not a year from now when many of them will have already sold their cows. 
   Let me emphasize that this is a national solution to a national problem. It is not a regional fix. It does not exclude any dairy farmer from participation. And it does not help some at the expense of others. It helps all dairy farmers. 
   But it is, like last year's funding, merely a bandage to stop the bleeding. Dairy farmers everywhere need a meaningful safety net, not regional milk cartels. I urge my colleagues who have sought regional solutions to depressed dairy farm income to join me in my efforts to fight for a new, national dairy policy that will provide both an adequate safety net and hope to dairy farmers across the nation.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to applaud this morning's bipartisan ``firearm summit'' at the White House. A commitment to find an agreeable compromise on the Juvenile Justice Bill could not be more timely. 
   A week ago today, Mr. President, a six-year old living in a drug-infested flophouse in Mount Morris Township, Michigan found a gun under a quilt. The six-year old who found that gun wanted to settle a playground quarrel he had the previous day with his classmate, Kayla Rolland. 
   He was able to grab the gun from under the quilt because blankets are not trigger locks; they are not a sufficient deterrent to curious children who find guns lying around unlocked. He took the gun and hid it in his pants and brought it to school the next day. No one and nothing prevented him from doing so. 
   When he arrived at Buell Elementary School, the boy announced to Kayla that she was not his friend. He waited for an opportunity to get back at her. He later said he wanted to scare her. 
   As his classmates were filing out and heading toward the school library, he had his chance. He did not call her names; he did not pull her hair; he did not hit her. Instead, he pulled the gun from his pants and waved it at two other classmates. He then accurately set his sights on Kayla, pulled the trigger, and killed her. She was all of six years old. He shot her dead in their first grade classroom. 
   He had access to the gun because it was not safely stored, and he was able to fire it because the gun did not have a safety lock. Either would have saved Kayla's life. 
   I have heard skeptics say that our child safety lock proposal, which 78 Senators supported last year, would not have mattered in this case because this gun was stolen. That is only half-true. Had the legal owner of this gun safely locked it with one of the devices mandated under our bill, then the thief might not have stolen it. Had the legal owner of this gun safely locked it with one of the devices mandated under our bill, the child's uncle might not have been able to leave it loaded within the boy's reach. Had the legal owner of this gun safely locked it with one of the devices mandated under our bill, the first grader could not have picked it up and used it with deadly accuracy. 
   How do we respond to this tragedy? How do we respond to others like it? There is no simple answer. But without a doubt, enacting our modest legislation to mandate that a child safety lock be sold with every handgun would be a good first step. 
   The distinguished Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, HENRY HYDE, said over the weekend about the stalled gun provisions of the Juvenile Justice bill, ``If you can't get dinner, at least get a sandwich.'' I agree. 
   Chairman HYDE, who has always been committed to reasonable firearms control, would prefer dinner. And I would too: we ought to pass the whole Juvenile Justice bill. We ought to do it soon. Time is of the essence because while the Congressional attention span is short, children die even when Congress isn't watching. We need to do more to protect children from guns and we need to do it now. 
   It is a regrettable truth that progress in the Juvenile Justice debate lurches forward only in reaction to unspeakable tragedy. A year ago next month, the massacre at Columbine and the shooting in Conyers, Georgia shocked this Senate into passing common sense proposals to get tough on thugs and violent juveniles. Some of those very same measures, including child safety locks, failed to pass the Senate by wide margins just the previous year. 
   But the overwhelming approval of the child safety lock proposal demonstrates that the Senate ``gets it:'' kids and guns do not mix. The House needs to ``get it'' too. The Center for Disease Control estimates that nearly 1.2 million ``latch-key'' children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that children and teenagers cause over 10,000 unintentional shootings each year in which at least 800 people die. In addition, over 1,900 children and teenagers attempt suicide with a firearm each year. Tragically, over three-fourths of them are successful. 
   If preventable suicides and accidents are not enough to convince you that guns must be kept out of the hands of children, consider the following: within the next five years, firearms will overtake motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of death among American children. The rate of firearm death of children under 15 years old is 16 times higher in the U.S. than in the 25 other industrialized nations combined. And the firearm injury ``epidemic,'' due largely to handgun injuries, is ten times larger than the polio epidemic of the first half of the 20th century. 
   The very same day that young Kayla Rolland was tragically killed in Michigan, a 12 year old middle school student in the Milwaukee area carried a loaded gun to school. A disagreement the previous day led him to seek revenge by scaring his classmates. Thankfully, he never used the gun and school officials safely confiscated it. This scenario is replicated across the country every day. 
   Requiring child safety locks will drive the number of juvenile gun deaths down--something everyone approves of. 
   Mr. President, we have the opportunity to reduce what will soon be the number one cause of death among American children. How can we sit idly by when preventing it is so attainable? 
   We cannot. 
   So we ought to pass the Kohl-Chafee-Hatch Child Safety Lock Act. Alone or, better yet, as part of a package, it will help prevent the tragic accidents associated with unauthorized, unlocked, unattended firearms. I am pleased that the President called today's summit to try to move on these urgent matters. I am distressed that it seems, at least today, unproductive. And I pledge to work with the President and the bipartisan Leadership to act now so that we do not have to mourn more preventable innocent deaths.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of both the pending amendment and the underlying Education Savings Account bill. Education Savings Accounts will clearly help some families save money for their children's education, but they are only part of the solution to improving education in our country. 
   The amendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana is another part. It represents the work of several Senators who are trying to take a realistic, effective approach to improving public education. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a serious look at our bill, the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act--better known as ``Three R's''. 
   We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving public education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in place. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores have risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased. But there are still significant improvements to be made. A recent study of students from 41 different countries found that American students still score far behind those in other countries. 
   Addressing this sort of fundamental failure is going to take more than cosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the structure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired partisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a middle ground approach that will truly help our States, school districts--and most importantly, our students. 
   Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student achievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap between low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To accomplish this, our bill centers around three principles.  
   First, we believe that we must continue to invest in education, and invest wisely, targeting funds where they are needed the most. Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the best position to know what their educational needs are. They should be given more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to meet those needs. And third, and most importantly, in exchange for increased flexibility, public schools must be accountable for results. These principles are a pyramid, with accountability being the base that supports the federal government's grant of flexibility and funds. 
   For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to States and school districts--regardless of how well they educate their students. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good job. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are struggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure. 
   The amendment before us now is the Teacher Quality and Professional Development section of the ``Three R's'' bill. It would increase funding for teacher quality and professional development to $2 billion, and target those funds to the neediest school districts. It gives States and school districts more flexibility to design teacher recruitment, mentoring, and professional development programs. And it requires States and school districts to ensure that every student will be taught by a fully qualified teacher--and holds them accountable for making sure that happens. 
   Mr. President, the amendment before us today is just one part of the ``Three R's'' bill. It focuses on one of the most important parts of improving education--improving teaching. It is an example of how, by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility--and most importantly, accountability--we can work with our State and local partners to make sure every child is taught by a qualified teacher. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues when the Senate considers ESEA.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of John C. Schnabel, who retired after fourteen years of service from the Wisconsin Association of County Veteran's Service Officers. He began his career with the Wisconsin Association of County Veteran's Service Officers in 1989 as the Secretary of the organization. During that time he used his personal laptop computer to electronically record Association records. This included researching and organizing a history of all CVSOs and Assistant CVSOs. He also developed and printed the first handbook for Association Officers so that policies, procedures and other information were easily transferred from one secretary to the next. John Schnabel was effective in his career as Secretary of CVSO and went on to become Second Vice President in 1994, First Vice President in 1995 and President in 1996. Schnabel has been the Langlade County Veteran's Services Officer for the last 14 years and is the first service officer from the county to be elected president of the organization. 
   During his time as president he became instrumental in the establishment of the Advocacy Award as well as the state representative to coordinate access to VA OnLine, initiating sites for CVSOs and WDVA. He has worked on many Ad Hoc committees regarding computer operations and program development. He most recently acted as a member of an Ad Hoc committee to establish long term goals and training for the CVSO association. During his tenure, Schnabel was also named a recipient of the Citation for Meritorious Service, awarded by the American Legion's National Veteran's Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission in Washington, D.C. 
   The staff and veteran clients of the Langlade County Veteran's Service Office and the Wisconsin Association of County Veterans Service Officers will miss John's wonderful advocacy work greatly. However, Nancy, his wife of 36 years will enjoy spending more time with him.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in many ways, the life of Carter Woodson represents the history of his race in America. 
   As a young man in the late 1800s, he worked in the fields and in a coal mine. He took a break from the grueling work to educate himself, enroll in high school and graduate after only two years of instruction. He went back to the coal mines to support himself, attending school when he could, and eventually earned a doctorate in history from Harvard University. Mr. Woodson went on to become a passionate student and teacher of Black History, establishing an annual reflection on his culture's accomplishments and resilience: Black History Month. 
   In celebration of this month, I would like to recognize another leader who has worked hard to chronicle the history of people of African heritage: Dr. James Cameron, founder of America's Black Holocaust Museum, located in Milwaukee. This museum is dedicated to documenting the injustices that African Americans have suffered, and to remind us at how far we've come as a society from the racism of the past. 
   Dr. Cameron, the only known living survivor of a lynch mob attack in the  country, founded America's Black Holocaust Museum in 1988 after an inspirational visit to the Yad Vashem Jewish Holocaust Memorial in Israel--just as this museum was constructed to remind us of the atrocities committed against Jewish people during World War II, Dr. Cameron wanted to ensure that Americans would not forget what kind of inhumanity African Americans have endured. 
   Today, as I discovered on my own visit to the museum, it has grown to become a major educational and cultural center for the nation which thousands of people of many different backgrounds visit each year. It regularly hosts prominent exhibitions such as historical artifacts collected from a wrecked slave ship and a Smithsonian exhibit on the civil rights movement. America's Black History Museum also prepares educational material for teachers and worked with UW-Milwaukee to offer an on-site, for-credit course to undergraduate and graduate students. 
   The work of Dr. Cameron, and this month established by the hard work of Mr. Woodson, remind us that the protection of civil rights and civil liberties for all should continue to be a top priority. I strongly believe in equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, creed, or gender. Everyone should have the same equal chance to get an education or a job, or to own a home or live in the neighborhood of their choice. In other words, we all deserve a place at the starting line so that we can then use our own abilities, hard work and dedication to succeed in life. 
   Of course, our country has yet to fully live up to the promise of equal opportunity for all. While Congress tries to find ways to address the crisis of discrimination, it is very important that everyone remember that we also have to respond on a personal level. No matter what answers Congress comes up with here in Washington, people need to try to be role models and lead by example. By teaching us about the racial injustices of the past, celebrating the resilience of African Americans and educating us about how to move forward from the prejudice and bias that plagues much of Black History, America's Black Holocaust Museum is one such example. 
   This month, let's all take a moment to reflect on the history African Americans and the many lessons that it teaches us about equality, dignity and harmony. The dedication of Carter Woodson and James Cameron to helping us remember deserves nothing less.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to the celebration of National TRIO Day. National TRIO Day was designated by concurrent resolution on February 24, 1986, by the 99th Congress and is celebrated on the last Saturday of February each year as a day of recognition for the Federal TRIO Program. 
   The Federal TRIO Program--consisting of the Talent Search, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math/Science, Veterans Upward Bound, Student Support Services, Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, and Educational Achievement Centers--was established over 30 years ago to assist low-income students overcome class, social, and cultural barriers to higher education. 
   Currently, 2,000 colleges, universities, and community agencies sponsor TRIO Programs, and over 780,000 low-income students between the ages of 11 and 27 benefit from the services of the TRIO Programs. Most come from families in  which neither parent graduated from college. These students, motivated by their hopes and aspirations, are living symbols of the American dream. Helping to lift them out of poverty benefits not only benefits the students themselves, but our entire nation. 
   There are 62 TRIO Programs in Wisconsin and I have seen these programs work at the local level. One inspirational story involves Dr. Lo from La Crosse, Wisconsin. As a child, Dr. Lo fled a refugee camp in war-torn Laos with his family and came to live in Wisconsin. Dr. Lo, with hard work and the benefit of two TRIO programs, graduated from UW-La Crosse with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology and went on to earn a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. He returned to Wisconsin to contribute to the La Crosse community through private practice at the La Crosse Natural Health Center, Habitat for Humanity Family Selection Committee, and as a member of the Equal Opportunity Commission for the city of La Crosse. 
   There is no limit to what TRIO participants can accomplish. Program graduates have become successful in all spheres of society and have gone on to enjoy careers as doctors, lawyers, astronauts, television reporters, actors, state politicians and Members of Congress, to list a few. Indeed, two of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, Representative HENRY BONILLA and Representative ALBERT R. WYNN are graduates of the TRIO Programs. 
   I have long supported TRIO and will continue to push for increased funding for these important programs. I am proud to celebrate National TRIO Day and call much deserved attention to these vital programs. I also encourage my colleagues to visit the TRIO Programs in their states and learn for themselves how successful these programs are for our Nation's students.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I strongly support Alan Greenspan's renomination to Chair the Federal Reserve Board for a fourth term. 
   The United States is currently enjoying the longest period of economic growth in our history, with price stability and record low unemployment. Welfare rolls have been dramatically reduced, and we have more Americans in homes of their own and invested in the burgeoning stock market than ever before. 
   As Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for the past 12 years, Dr. Greenspan deserves no small amount of the credit for this unprecedented growth and prosperity. Chairman Greenspan has consistently steered American monetary policy on a prudent and responsible course. He has won the respect and confidence of policymakers, the financial services industry and the American people. Indeed, we have witnessed that Alan Greenspan's words alone have the potential to trigger fluctuations on the global markets. Commendably, Chairman Greenspan has also upheld a high standard of evenhanded, apolitical management of our nation's money supply. And last year, Chairman Greenspan played a critical leadership role in the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Law to expand the market powers and competitiveness of our financial institutions, while lowering fees and promoting financial product innovation to the benefit of all Americans. 
   And this strong economy has coincided with fiscal discipline on our part, rather than the deficit spending of the past. The Federal budget is balanced, and, this year, we will hopefully take continued steps to retire more of the $5 trillion national debt. As Chairman Greenspan has advised, retiring the debt is one of the most important steps we can take to promote continued economic growth and plan for the future financial challenges of the aging of the baby boomer generation. There is room for tax cuts. There is room to increase spending on important domestic priorities, but debt reduction should remain a centerpiece of our economic agenda. 
   We can be confident that Alan Greenspan will continue providing vital leadership of monetary policy toward our common goal of keeping the economy robust. Considering his past record and looking to the future, he deserves reappointment, and I urge my colleagues to support his renomination.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my guarded support for the Bankruptcy Reform Act currently before the Senate. The troubling and dramatic rise in the number of bankruptcy filings demands our careful attention, and this legislation--if balanced and fair--will shore up the most significant cracks in our current system, but still grant a ``fresh start'' to those debtors who truly deserve it. 
   One of the ways this bill works to eliminate the most egregious abuses of the bankruptcy code is by finally placing a federal cap on the unlimited homestead exemption. This provision, which I introduced with Senators SESSIONS and GRASSLEY, would close an inexcusable loophole which currently allows millionaire deadbeats to keep their luxury homes while their legitimate creditors get left out in the cold. A cap is not only the best policy, it sends the best message: that bankruptcy is a tool of last resort, not a tool for financial planning. 
   And don't just take my word for it: ask my colleagues in the Senate. At the end of last session, we passed our $100,000 homestead cap by an overwhelming margin of 76-22. 
   However Mr. President, if this legislation comes out of Conference unbalanced, rest assured that I will be happy to vote against final passage of the bill, as I did last Congress. A major factor in my determination of what constitutes ``balance'' will be the status of the homestead cap. 
   That said, I support this bill today because I believe it will repair and improve our bankruptcy system, and help restore the stigma to bankruptcy. But without the homestead cap, this bill will likely fall short of its goal.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to express my support for the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. This bipartisan measure is a crucial step in the battle against the spread of Methamphetamine, also known as ``Meth.'' It sets forward a comprehensive approach including targeted enforcement through increased resources, training and penalties, expansion of prevention and intervention programs, environmental cleanup, and research. 
   The Meth problem is growing rapidly--not only across the country westward, but also in my home state: our Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory has tripled the number of Meth examinations since 1996, with prosecutions doubling from previous years; thefts of the precursor chemical Anhydrous Ammonia from farmers and retailers are becoming routine; and more Meth producers are emptying out shelves of ``blister packs''--packages of Sudafed and other cold remedies which are legal products used as precursor chemicals and sold in our markets and retail stores. Just last week, law enforcement officers in Fox Valley, Wisconsin reported their first seizure of a Meth lab, evidencing Meth's quick spread across the state. 
   In fact, Wisconsin has become a source of one of the most toxic of Meth recipes--known to its Western producers as the ``Nazi variety''--which causes the most aggressive behavior. This is largely due to the availability of Anhydrous Ammonia, which accelerates users to a fast and violent high. At the same time, the environmental dangers associated with this chemical pose a serious threat to our law enforcement officers and our communities. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill includes several provisions from the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999, introduced by Senator GRASSLEY and me earlier this year. In particular, the underlying bill authorizes $6.5 million for additional Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents in rural areas and $5.5 million for DEA training designed to combat ``meth'' production. In addition, it criminalizes the transport and sale of Anhydrous Ammonia. These provisions will be of great assistance to rural states like Wisconsin, adding to the ongoing efforts of state and local law enforcement and building on the $1 million in funding I helped secure through the Appropriations process for a Meth ``Task Force'' in Western Wisconsin. 
   As Meth continues its devastation throughout the Midwest, it is time to confront this raging menace at multiple levels and with cooperative strength. This bipartisan legislation is an important step in that direction.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I sincerely thank all of my colleagues who have spoken up this afternoon. It has been remarkable to hear Senators from both sides of the aisle express themselves in such a heartwarming way, and I think in such a fair and clear way with respect to this country of ours and how our economy works and how it is intended to work. 
   It is remarkable to me that all these leaders have made clear that while we are passing dairy legislation this afternoon, it is of necessity, and not because they and we believe in the specifics of that legislation. It is heartwarming for me to know that when we come back next year, we apparently have common agreement on both sides of the aisle that we are going to work together to come up with dairy legislation that more clearly and fairly represents the interests not only of the different parts of our country in terms of our States and regions but more clearly represents the real intentions of our Constitution with respect to how this economy is supposed to work and how the free enterprise system is supposed to work. 
   It has been a long, hard fight for myself, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator GRAMS, and others. Certainly, what happened here this afternoon, in my opinion, justifies that fight and leaves me feeling very good about my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and feeling very optimistic about the things we can look forward to next year.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Work Incentives Conference Report. As my colleagues know, this conference report contains a number of items that have been joined together in order to accommodate the end of session schedule, and I would like to offer brief comments on several of those items. 
   With regard to the tax portion of the conference report, I am in support of the compromise that was reached to extend the expired tax credits. Earlier this year, I supported an ambitious tax relief package which extended the credits and contained my child care tax credit and farmer income averaging relief provisions, as well as targeted tax measures to help Americans pay for education and health care and to expand the low-income housing tax credit. Hardworking American taxpayers created the budget surplus, and a significant portion of that surplus should be returned to them, allowing them to keep more of their own paychecks and helping them plan for their future. It is my hope that when we return in the spring, we will rise above partisan concerns and achieve bipartisan progress towards comprehensive tax relief, as well as the challenge of reforming both Medicare and Social Security And we must do so while continuing our vigilance in protecting the balanced budget gains of recent years. 
   But for today we will content ourselves with the limited extenders package before us. The research and development tax credit promotes innovation and enhances the competitiveness of American business. The work opportunity and welfare-to-work tax credits continue the partnership between the public and private sector to move those in need of a helping hand off of public assistance and into the workforce. I am also pleased that this tax package preserves eligibility to important tax benefits, such as the child tax credit, by protecting against the encroachment of the alternative minimum tax. While I am concerned that the conferees did not offset fully the costs of these provisions and would have preferred a final version along the lines of the bipartisan, and fully offset, Senate bill, this package is modest and urgently needed. It deserves our endorsement. 
   I am extremely pleased that we are finally taking the final step to enact the Work Incentives Improvement Act into law. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe strongly that it will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people with disabilities. 
   Currently, over 9 million people receive disability benefits through the SSDI and SSI programs. Only 1/2 of 1 percent of SSDI beneficiaries, and only 1 percent of SSI beneficiaries ever return to work. Yet we know that many--in fact, the vast majority--of people with disabilities want to work. In study after study, people with disabilities report that the single biggest obstacle to returning to work is the loss of health care benefits that often comes along with their decision to work. Many do not have access to employer-based health insurance and find policies in the individual insurance market prohibitively expensive. Therefore, disabled beneficiaries who want to work are faced with the choice of returning to work while risking their health benefits or forgoing work to maintain health coverage. 
   This is simply unacceptable. People with disabilities deserve every opportunity to live healthy, productive lives, and we should encourage and support their efforts to work by ensuring that they continue to have access to the health care services they need. I am pleased that the Work Incentives Improvement Act accomplishes that goal. This bill will ensure that millions of people with disabilities have the opportunity to work if they are able--without the fear of losing the health insurance coverage they need in order to live healthier lives and to succeed in their work. I want to commend the bipartisan efforts of Chairman ROTH, Senator MOYNIHAN, Chairman JEFFORDS, and Senator KENNEDY, in making this bill a reality. 
   Again, I regret that end-of-year pressure has forced us to combine so many unrelated provisions into a single bill. However, I support the conference report for the reasons I have just stated, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its adoption.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 which is now included as part of this year's Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Simply put, these changes in the law are long overdue. 
   It should come as no surprise that the final version of this legislation is the product of compromise. Certainly, no one received everything they wanted. However, at the end of the day, everyone can walk away and say they got something. That holds true for broadcasters, satellite companies and, most importantly and to the greatest degree, consumers.  
   The single most important thing that this bill will do is ``level the playing field'' so that satellite companies can better compete with cable. It does so by changing the anomaly in the law that prohibits satellite companies from broadcasting local signals to local people, lowering the royalty rates paid by satellite companies and, among other things, removing the unconscionable 90 day waiting period that a consumer must endure before switching from cable to satellite service. We also grant a six month ``grace period'' for ``local-into-local'' retransmission consent agreements. I am not so sure that this is quite the ``Holy Grail'' for consumers that some believe it is; however, I doubt the sky is going to fall down for the networks either. 
   To ensure that all local stations are carried and to keep the playing field as level as possible, this legislation imposes full ``must carry'' obligations by 2002 upon satellite providers, just as current law does on cable. That is, if a satellite company carries one local station in a market, then it must carry all the local stations. Now, reasonable people can disagree about ``must carry''--the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality by a slim 5-4 vote--but it is only fair to apply it evenly to both cable and satellite companies. 
   This Conference Report also lays to rest many of the thorny disputes that have served only to hurt consumers. Both the Senate and the House have agreed to ``grandfather'' those consumers in the Grade B service area who currently receive ``distant network'' signals. To be sure, some satellite companies have been bad actors in this debate and so have some subscribers. Nonetheless, short of deposing each and every consumer, it's best to put these problems behind us and start off on a clean slate. We expect that going forward the letter of the law will be adhered to and respected--heavy penalties await those who would do otherwise, and rightfully so. 
   The matter of ``if and when'' a consumer should receive a waiver from a local broadcaster currently resembles a Sherlock Holmes mystery. So we order the FCC to draft ``consumer-friendly'' regulations to govern the waiver process. Our bill tells local broadcasters that if they fail to act on waiver requests within 30 days, the request will be ``deemed'' approved. We trust the FCC will improve and simplify this process even further. 
   Just as importantly, we ask the FCC to take a hard look at whether the Grade B standard is sufficient to determine what a good picture is in today's world. The truth is that if there's a fairer standard out there, then we should apply it. Rest assured, the Congress will get the last bite at the apple by requiring the FCC to report back to Congress with its findings, rather than allowing the Commission to ``self-execute'' its new study. 
   Let me make one final point regarding one of the most difficult matters in Conference: retransmission consent. The original House language was predicated on the belief that there exists unequal bargaining positions between the broadcasters and the satellite companies. Our Senate bill took precisely the opposite approach. But our law comes out somewhere in the middle: it will prohibit exclusive deals, ensure that parties negotiate in ``good faith'' when making these agreements, and put some teeth into ``good faith'' by adding the ``competitive marketplace considerations'' language. 
   That said, there may be some disagreement as to what exactly this new provision means. At the very least, ``competitive marketplace considerations'' may simply be interpreted as the normal, everyday jostling that takes place in the business world. At the very most, a ``competitive marketplace'' would tolerate differences based upon legitimate cost justifications, but not anti-competitive practices such as illegal tying and bundling. The answer probably lies somewhere between these two interpretations and we trust the sometimes confused FCC, as we often do, to properly divine the real intent of a somewhat confused Congress. 
   Again, this isn't a perfect bill. Far from it. But we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This measure will allow satellite companies to compete more aggressively with cable; it will provide more choice for consumers; with luck, it may even discipline rising cable rates. So I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan, fair, and comprehensive legislation that was the product of a great deal of hard work and negotiation. We owe consumers no less than that.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I want to express my appreciation for all of the hard work that Senators STEVENS and BYRD, SPECTER and HARKIN have put into the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations bill in the face of enormous budgetary challenges. I also appreciate all they have done to accomodate my priorities during this process. 
   The 20th Century is coming to a close during a time of unprecedented economic growth and budget surpluses. However, as we celebrate our nation's prosperity, we must make sure we don't leave any of our most vulnerable citizens behind. In my opinion, that's what this bill, which funds vital health and education programs in the year 2000, should be about: making a strong commitment to our aging parents and grandparents--who made this country what it is today, as well as to our children--who will determine its future. 
   I am pleased that this bill takes several important steps in that direction. First, this bill continues to make early childhood education and child care a top priority. I am very pleased that the bill includes a $608 million increase to the Head Start program. This program gives young children from lower-income families a real chance to succeed by providing educational, health, and other child care services. 
   Second, I am glad to see that this bill includes a nearly $30 million increase for States to inspect nursing homes and ensure they are safe. As a member of the Senate Aging Committee, I have had the unfortunate opportunity to hear firsthand about cases of abuse and neglect in many of our nation's nursing homes. Our seniors and disabled deserve the best possible care, and this funding will help make sure they get it. In addition, the bill includes a $1 million increase for the Long-term Care Ombudsman program. Ombudsmen serve as advocates for long-term care residents and help them to resolve complaints of neglect and abuse. They are a critical component of ensuring the safety of our seniors in nursing homes and other long-term care settings. 
   I am also extremely pleased that the bill includes another $100 million increase for Community Health Centers. The number of uninsured in our country continues to grow. Health centers  provide treatment to large numbers of uninsured and should be commended for the incredible work they do. This increase will help them meet the increased demand for care, and ensure that patients get the quality health care services they need. 
   This bill also fully funds the LIHEAP program. This program is vital to low-income families in Wisconsin who need assistance with heating costs during the cold winter months. I am pleased that this bill continues to make this program a top priority. 
   I am also pleased that in addition to the $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, report language was included in the bill that targets many of the diseases that are devastating families across our nation. The bill includes report language I requested to increase research into epilepsy, particularly intractable epilepsy, which primarily starts in childhood and affects nearly 75,000 of the 3 million individuals with epilepsy. 
   In addition, at my urging, the bill also includes $90 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research within NIH. Nursing research is different from biomedical research but just as necessary. This research focuses on reducing the burden and suffering of illness, improving the quality of life by preventing and delaying the onset of disease, and by looking for better ways to promote health and prevent disease. 
   I am pleased that the bill also includes report language that strongly urges more research into Alzheimer's Disease. This devastating disease affects nearly 4 million people in the United States, including 100,000 in Wisconsin. The total annual cost of Alzheimer care is over $100 billion. Searching for new treatments--and ultimately a cure--must be one of our top priorities in biomedical research, to alleviate both the suffering and the costs associated with this awful disease. 
   I also want to thank Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for their willingness to work with me on some of my other priorities. At my request, language was included in the Senate report to start a demonstration program within HRSA to increase the number of mental health professionals in underserved areas--particularly those suffering from recent farm crises. I 
   am hopeful that HRSA will allocate at least $1 million toward this initiative. 
   Funds have also been provided to CDC to expand their efforts to prevent birth defects through the promotion of folic acid among women of childbearing age. I have sponsored, along with Senators ABRAHAM and BOND, a bill that would authorize $20 million to CDC for this purpose, and I am pleased that this appropriations bill gets this initiative underway. In addition, I am pleased that the Ryan White Comprehensive Care program received an increase of $86 million to expand services for people living with HIV and AIDS. 
   I'd now like to talk a bit about funding for education. While I am concerned about the use of advance funding for many of our education programs, I am pleased that this bill provides necessary increases for education. Title I--which provides assistance to disadvantaged youth, received a $209 million increase, although we must do much better than that in the future in order to serve all Title I-eligible children. I am also pleased that Special Education received a large increase in funding, although we still have a great deal of work to do to live up to our commitment to fund 40% of the costs of the program. We still need to do more in both these areas, but this is a good start. 
   In addition, I strongly support the $253 million increase for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, for a total of $453 million for FY 2000. I have visited several of these afterschool programs in my State and I have seen firsthand how successful and critically important they are. These programs give kids a safe place to go after school, keep them off the streets, and out of trouble. It is supported on a bipartisan basis, by parents, teachers, and police chiefs. Last year, thousands of applications were submitted for only 184 grants. However, I believe it deserves an even stronger investment than this bill provides, which is why I voted for an amendment during consideration of the Senate version to provide $600 million for this worthy program. Although that amendment failed, I will continue to fight for more funding for after-school programs next year. 
   This bill also makes greater strides to give students the tools they need to go to college. First, the bill increases the maximum Pell Grant award to $3,300, and I am hopeful we can further increase this amount next year. It also increases the Federal Work-Study program by $64 million. TRIO programs also received a $45 million increase, and I am pleased that more students will be able to take advantage of TRIO programs that give lower-income students a better chance to go to college. I also strongly support the $80 million increase for the GEAR-UP program. This program gives many middle school students their first real opportunity to strive toward going to college. I am hopeful that we will further increase funding for this program in future years. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the conference report maintains and increases our commitment to hiring 100,000 teachers and reducing class sizes in the early grades. Class size reduction efforts have produced tremendous results in Wisconsin and across the nation. It is essential that we continue to provide the resources States and school districts need to put a qualified teacher in every classroom. Our students deserve nothing less. 
   I am pleased that these important education programs have received increases. However, I also have several significant concerns about the education section of the bill. 
   First, I am deeply concerned that the bill level funds the Child Care & Development Block Grant. The Senate bill included an amendment, which I supported, to increase funding for the CCDBG from $1.2 billion to $2 billion. This amendment had strong bipartisan support because there is now widespread recognition that child care is critical to the success of working families. Unfortunately, this amendment was dropped during negotiations of the conference report. This is a serious mistake, and one that will have serious repercussions for working families. Programs funded by the CCDBG ensure that parents have a safe, educational place to send their children during the workday. Businesses experience less absenteeism and greater productivity when their employees know their children are well taken care of. When families who need quality, affordable child care are able to find it, everybody wins. It's that simple. I strongly believe that we must renew our commitment to expanding access to child care, and I will continue to make child care funding a top priority and fight hard for future increases. 
   Second, and even more importantly, I have serious concerns about the bill's substantial use of advance funding for education. I am not convinced that this practice is completely benign, and I believe we must watch carefully how the delayed release of education funds impacts school 
   budgets. 
   However, I have an even deeper concern about the use of advance funding. The hard truth is this: we would not be forced to use advance funding, nor any budget gimmicks at all, if this bill received the priority it deserved. This bill, which funds our most basic needs--health care and education--was left for dead last. It was raided repeatedly to fund other programs, leaving it at one point with a more than $15 billion shortfall. We would not be in the budgetary box we find ourselves in today if this bill had been the top priority it should be. I hope that in the future my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have the will to pass this bill early and send a strong message that education and health care are our top priorities, not our last. 
   Besides education, there are several other areas of the bill that I believe must be improved in future budgets. First, while I am pleased that the bill sets aside $19.1 million in the Child Care & Development Block Grant for Resource and Referral programs, I am concerned this just isn't enough. R&R programs serve as a resource to help parents locate quality, affordable child care in their communities. When parents need child care, they call R&R agencies, who have the tools to direct parents to appropriate child care providers in their area that meet each family's unique needs. With growing numbers of parents entering the workforce, the need for R&R is greater than ever. I would like to continue to work with Senators SPECTER and HARKIN, as  well as all of my colleagues, on increasing this set-aside to $50 million to meet the increasing demand for referral services. 
   I am also very concerned about the cut in the Social Services Block Grant. The State of Wisconsin and our counties rely on SSBG to fund a variety of social service programs. These include supportive home care and community living services for the elderly and disabled, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, temporary shelter for homeless families, and child abuse prevention and intervention services. States and counties rely on these funds, and it is wrong to renege on our commitment to SSBG funding. 
   I am also very concerned about programs for senior citizens under the Older Americans Act. I am pleased to see that the bill includes a $35 million increase for home-delivered meals to seniors. However, we must also find a way to make a stronger investment in the Supportive Services and Senior Centers program. This program provides funds to Area Agencies on Aging, which in turn provide a wide range of assistance to frail elderly. In addition, we must also provide assistance to the growing number of Americans who are taking care of elderly and disabled relatives. I am a cosponsor of the Family Caregiver Support Act, which provides $125 million in assistance and respite for caregivers. Unfortunately, this bill does not fund this necessary program, but I hope we can enact it into law quickly next year. 
   The National Senior Service Corps is a program we should all be proud of and support increased funding. These programs utilize the skills and experience of older Americans in our communities. Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, and RSVP give seniors a chance to work with children, families and other seniors, and we are all the richer for their contributions. I am pleased that the bill includes increases for these programs, and I believe we must provide more in the future lest we waste this priceless resource we have in our seniors. 
   In addition to the Labor, HHS component, this Omnibus Appropriations bill includes some desperately needed relief for our nation's health care providers. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included many provisions that reduced Medicare payments further than Congress intended. Providers have been forced to reduce benefits or worse--many providers in my State and across the nation have closed altogether. I have strongly supported efforts to alleviate those cuts and have worked with many of my colleagues over the past year to fight for a solution. I am pleased that the Conference Report includes provisions to assist hospitals, home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities and other providers. In the end, Medicare beneficiaries are the ones who truly benefit, and this bill will help ensure that seniors in Wisconsin and throughout the nation continue to receive the health care services they need and deserve. 
   Overall, I believe this is a good bill, and I commend the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Appropriations Committee and the Labor, HHS Subcommittee, as well as the Finance Committee, for their hard work. Unfortunately, because unrelated dairy provisions that I strongly oppose were included in this conference report, I reluctantly must vote against it. However, I want to make clear that I strongly support the vast majority of the increases in this bill--increases that will go a long way toward ensuring that our children and our elderly receive the important services they need. I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for doing such a great job this year under such difficult budgetary circumstances, and for their willingness to work with me on items of concern to me and my State. I look forward to working with them again next year on this vitally important bill.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation to crack down on abuses in the traveling sales crew industry. These companies employ crews who travel from city to city selling products door to door. Often times, however, these companies mistreat their workers and violate local, state, and federal labor law. Because they rapidly move from state to state, enforcement efforts are difficult if not impossible for local authorities. 
   The plight of the workers in this business came home to me, and the citizens of Wisconsin, as a result of a particularly tragic crash in March of this year. A van carrying 14 young people overturned due to reckless driving, killing seven and injuring the others, many seriously. The driver had a suspended license and a series of violations. Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident. Since 1992, forty-two sales people have been killed or injured in similar crashes. The company involved in the Wisconsin crash had 92 labor violations and 105 violations for soliciting without a license. 
   Regrettably, there is more to these companies than just bad driving records. In 1987 Senator ROTH, as part of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations looked into this industry, and was appalled at what he found. Incidents of verbal and physical abuse of workers were widespread. Young people were coerced into continuing to sell long after they wanted to leave through threats and taunts from their employees. When sellers were able to get free they were often unpaid or denied the bus ticket home they were promised when they signed up. 
   The compensation system for the workers was also rigged to ensure that workers could not leave. Prospective sellers were promised big bucks when they were recruited, but soon found that decent pay was difficult to come by. Sellers were paid on a commission basis according to their sales, but they were also charged by the company for their accommodations and fined for small infractions like showing up late to meetings or sleeping on the van. Salespeople were not paid in a timely manner, but their earnings were kept on ``paper'' and the employees only drew a daily allowance to pay for food. Employees were seldom allowed to see the paper work that tracked their earnings so they had little idea about how much they are entitled. Many found that they were not able to keep up with the sales and fell in debt to the company. After working 12 hours days, six days a week for months, employees actually owed the company money! These young people became indentured servants, working long hours for only room and board. 
   In the twelve years since Senator ROTH's investigation, nothing has changed. These abuses continue, and Congress should act. 
   In the Wisconsin case the company's record of disregard for local and state laws was a signal of their disdain for the safety of their workers. This company should not have been allowed to continue to operate with this kind of record. Government needed to step in earlier, before this tragedy occurred, instead of picking up the pieces afterward. 
   I am not one to frivolously engage in regulating business, but in this case the need for federal involvement is clear. Because of the mobility of these companies, states cannot crack down on these groups alone. They need federal help to eliminate the unscrupulous actors in the industry. 
   The Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act would take important steps to eliminate employers who abuse their workers. First, it would no longer allow minors to be employed in this line of work. Door to door sales can be dangerous work and combined with the long hours and hazardous travel, creates a job too dangerous for children. Second, the bill would narrowly eliminate the exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act for these specific kinds of operations. Covering these employees with minimum wages laws and overtime requirements protects them from becoming indentured servants to their employers through complex compensation systems. This provision is carefully crafted to cover only traveling sales crews, individuals who sell over the road, or at trade shows would be unaffected. Lastly the bill creates a licensing procedure through the Department of Labor to monitor those engaged in supervising and running these operations. 
   These measures are important steps forward in a nationwide effort to eliminate this particularly abusive form of worker exploitation. I hope I will have my colleagues support as I try to make the painful crash in Janesville, the last chapter in this shameful story.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will correct an unintended obstacle in current law and expand the number of low-income children in child care centers that receive nutritious meals through the Child and Adult Care Food Program. 
   The current CACFP law provides for subsidies to proprietary child care centers for the nutritious meals they serve children, provided that at least 25% of the participants receive Title XX subsidies. This provision was included to encourage private child care providers to serve more low-income children, by providing funds to reimburse the costs of providing meals. When the law was enacted in 1981, it made sense to tie CACFP funds to Title XX, because Title XX was the primary source of Federal child care assistance at that time. 
   As we all know, however, the Child Care & Development Block Grant has since become the States' primary funding source for child care assistance, while Title XX funds are being used primarily for other social service needs. This means that although many proprietary child care centers have enrollments with over 25% low-income children, those who no longer receive Title XX are no longer eligible for the CACFP meal subsidy. 
   Thirty-eight States are currently using small amounts of their Title XX funds for child care subsidies so that at least some of the otherwise eligible children will receive meals in proprietary centers. In Wisconsin, for example, 65 proprietary centers are currently participating in the CACFP program, serving 3,294 children. However, if all eligible centers were able to participate, those numbers could increase to 149 proprietary centers serving 8,195 children, an increase of 4,901 children. A simple change in the law to reflect the current nature of Federal child care assistance could lead to Wisconsin receiving nearly $2,975,000 each year in Federal food subsidies for low-income children in child care. 
   The bill I introduce today is simple. It would eliminate the outdated requirement that eligible children receive Title XX funds in order to trigger the CACFP meal subsidy. This would allow proprietary centers to participate in CACFP if at least 25% of the  children they serve are eligible for a food nutrition subsidy. This change will ensure that proprietary centers will be able to continue to serve low-income children. It reduces pressure on proprietary centers to increase their rates for non-subsidized children to recover the costs of unreimbursed meals for subsidized children. It preserves the right of parents, including low-income parents, to choose the quality child care center that is most appropriate for their children. And most importantly, this change reinforces the original intent of the law: to ensure that eligible low-income children in proprietary child care centers have the benefit of a nutritious meal. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation and I look forward to working for its swift passage when Congress reconvenes in January.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in the omnibus package that will be brought to the floor sometime this evening, there are two pieces of legislation on dairy that I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing because I think they are unfair and very much not in the spirit of the American economic system. 
   One is the Northeast Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact is an arrangement in which the New England States literally fix the price of milk in those seven States and no one can tamper with that price. It is the only price at which milk can be distributed from the farmer to the processor. In effect, it takes all the competition out of that product in that State, in all the New England States. We have never done that before in this country. It is contrary to everything that is represented by the economic system in the United States. 
   The reason why we have such a great country in part is because our economic system provides that anybody with a good idea to develop a product or a service has an unfettered opportunity in all 50 States to market that product. That is what has made America great: competition. That is why we have full employment, the best economy in the world, and an economy that can compete anywhere in the world and succeed. That is because in this country we say: In order to get your share of market, you have to be able to provide the best product at the best price and market it in the best way. There are no restrictions in the 50 States to do that. That has been true since the United States of America was originated. 
   The northeast dairy cartel is in contrast to that. There is nothing about the cartel that is American in terms of how we do business. There is something else about that. They say, and I have heard this from some of the leaders in the northeast: Can't we just have our cartel? After all, it represents only a fraction of the milk market in the country. Why can't we just have our cartel? But, obviously, if they can have their cartel, then everybody can have a cartel. What stops us from having a Southeast cartel or a Southwest cartel? What stops us from having a Southern cotton cartel? What stops us from having a Midwest corn cartel or a Plains States wheat cartel? If a cartel makes sense in any form, then it makes sense not only in the New England States and not only for milk; it makes sense anywhere, conceivably, and for any product. 
   Now I ask the question: Does the Senate want to go on record as favoring this type of economic policy? I think we all know the answer is not yes. Nobody has defended this to me, even though it is coming tonight. Nobody has defended it to me. I talked with the leaders in the Senate. I asked them to explain why we should have this kind of legislation in the omnibus bill. I tell you, not a leader, not a single Senator, has explained to me and defended in any way that makes sense the idea of price-fixing cartels. Yet here it comes. 
   I am told it is coming because promises have been made and arrangements have already occurred, and so on and so forth. On something as important as this, which is price-fixing cartels, it seems to me that saying ``promises have been made,'' and ``it has been passed in the House,'' or ``it is too late,'' or whatever, 
   does not make any sense. May I also say I have been in dialog with the leaders in the Senate for months on this, so this is not a surprise. So here we are with this piece of legislation. 
   Then we also have this milk pricing policy which, as you all know, arbitrates that the farther you are from Wisconsin in this country, the more you get for your milk if you are a dairy farmer. We all know, again, this was set up 50 or 60 years ago when there was no refrigeration to transport milk and they wanted to encourage the development of the dairy industry. So we provided incentives for dairy farmers at points distant from Wisconsin to develop the dairy industry and to circumvent the need for refrigerated transportation. That is no longer true.  
   So what we are trying to do is not to eliminate that price differential because that would be too big a step to take at once. We are trying to reduce the price differential--not eliminate it, reduce it. USDA has come up with a program and 97 percent of the farmers in this country have voted for the change in the present milk pricing program. I am not suggesting we need to eliminate the price differential at this time. But let's accept the reduction of the price differential in view of the fact that the present system is archaic and makes no sense. 
   Again, coming over from the House is legislation that continues to mandate that the old Depression-era pricing system be continued. May I also say the present system, both with respect to the Northeast Dairy Compact and the pricing system, was mandated to conclude on October 1, and we would put in a new system. But before October 1, there was a Federal judge in Vermont who challenged that kind of outcome. So right now it is tied up in the courts and nothing is going to happen. The present system will stay until at least the courts rule on the validity of a new system. 
   So I suggested, and many have suggested, there be no dairy language in the omnibus; just don't say anything and let's let this thing roll because it is tied up in the courts now anyhow, and we can discuss it next year. 
   No, promises have been made. People have been won over in one way or another. Other agendas are on the table. So today it comes in an omnibus bill, with the Northeast Dairy Compact renewed. Price fixing cartels, does any Senator want to vote for that? Price fixing cartels, not just for the Northeast, because if you accept it in the Northeast you accept it elsewhere; not just on milk, because a cartel is not uniquely suited to milk. It can be on any other commodity anywhere. 
   Does the Senate want to go on record as supporting price fixing cartels in this country? Do we want to tear up the American economy in that way? That comes in the omnibus tonight. We are going to vote on that. 
   We are also going to vote on going back to the old milk marketing price system which, again, is totally outmoded. The USDA has come up with a new system. I am very upset, obviously, and I am obviously going to fight that omnibus bill to its conclusion in any way I can, to filibuster it and to require everything be done to demonstrate to us and to the American people that there is a giant bill coming down the pike which has at least an element in it which is not acceptable, in my judgment, to how America is supposed to function. 
   We are also considering a continuing resolution that will be brought to the floor momentarily, I understand. Of course, one of the options we have is to vote against a continuing resolution, which would, in effect, shut down the Government at midnight tonight. I could object to the CR and the Government would shut down. That is something I had considered. But if we do that or if I do that, obviously, it is a huge step, and there are many tens of thousands of people who would be out of a job, with enormous dislocations all across our country. It is a huge step one does not take easily. It is not a step I want to take. It is not a step I am going to take because I do not think it represents responsible action on my part. If some of the other people in this body want to act in a way I consider to be irresponsible and challenge me to be irresponsible--I am not an irresponsible person. Shutting down the Government is a huge, huge decision. One does not take it lightly. I am not going to make that decision over this issue. 
   But I do want to point out to my colleagues that some strong-arm tactics are at work here. Allowing price fixing cartels is a bad thing for this country. I very much hope we can and will find a way to undo the damage of price fixing cartels in an outmoded milk marketing system in the very near future. 
   Having said that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will go far in helping children start their school day ready to learn. 
   The relationship between a healthy breakfast and both behavior and academic achievement has been documented by a number of studies. Fortunately, participation of schools in the School Breakfast program has increased steadily since the program was made permanent in 1975. According to the School Breakfast Scorecard, a report recently released by the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a record number of schools--70,000--provided breakfast to school children last year. And nearly half of our states have 80 percent or more of their schools serving both lunch and breakfast under the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. 
   That's good news. The bad news is that the gulf between states with the highest rates of school participation in breakfast and those with the lowest is wide. 20 percent of our states have fewer than 55 percent of their schools participating in both breakfast and lunch; that's a full 20 points below the national average. In my home state of Wisconsin, only 30 percent of the schools that serve lunch also serve breakfast. 
   By another measure--participation of low-income children in both school lunch and breakfast--the results from the Scorecard are equally concerning. Nationally, only 42 percent of the kids receiving a free or reduced price lunch are also receiving breakfast; some states have fewer than 25 percent of kids receiving a free or reduced price lunch also receiving school breakfast. 
   The bill I am introducing today would help states provide an additional financial incentive for schools to participate in the school breakfast program. While there are a number of reasons that schools do not offer their children a school breakfast, certainly the barrier most difficult to overcome is the cost of the meals throughout the year. In short, the cost of the school breakfast program may simply be too high for some schools and school districts. 
   My bill authorizes, subject to appropriations, grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to allow states to provide schools with an additional five cent per meal reimbursement during the first year in which they provide the school breakfast program. This additional reimbursement may be used to supplement both the existing federal per meal reimbursement and any additional per meal reimbursement provided by the state. To ensure that the grants are as effective as possible they are targeted to those states with poor school breakfast participation rates and that also have a program in place to promote school breakfast participation. State educational agencies will have the discretion to determine, based on participation rates, which schools or school districts will receive the supplemental assistance. 
   Providing a nutritious breakfast is the first step in ensuring that kids are ready to learn when they sit down at their desks each morning. The legislation I am introducing will go far in helping states and schools reach that goal and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Judgeship for Northeastern Wisconsin Act of 1999. This bill would create one additional judgeship in the eastern district of Wisconsin and seat it in Green Bay, at the center of a region in desperate need of a district court. Let me explain how an additional judgeship could alleviate the stress that the current system places on business, law enforcement agents, witnesses, victims and individual litigants in northeastern Wisconsin. 
   First, while the four full-time district court judges for the eastern district of Wisconsin currently preside in Milwaukee, for most litigants and witnesses in northeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee is well over 100 miles away. In fact, as the courts are currently arranged, the northern portion of the eastern district is more remote from a Federal court than any other major population center, commercial or industrial, in the United States. Thus, litigants and witnesses must incur substantial costs in traveling from northern Wisconsin to Milwaukee--costs in terms of time, money, resources, and effort. Indeed, driving from Green Bay to Milwaukee takes nearly two hours each way. Add inclement weather or a departure point north of Green Bay--such as Oconto or Marinette--and often the driving time alone actually exceeds the amount of time witnesses spend testifying. 
   Second, Mr. President, the few Wisconsin Federal judges serve a disproportionately large population. Last year, I commissioned a study by the General Accounting Office which revealed that Wisconsin Federal judges have to serve the highest population among all federal judges. Each sitting Federal judge in Wisconsin serves an average population of 859,966, while the remaining federal judges across the country--more than 650--serve less than half that number, with an average of 417,000 per judge. For example, while Louisiana has fewer residents than Wisconsin, it has 22 Federal judges, nearly four times as many as our state. 
   Third, Mr. President, Federal crimes remain unacceptably high in northeastern Wisconsin. These crimes range from bank robbery and kidnaping to Medicare and Medicaid fraud. However, without the appropriate judicial resources, a crackdown on Federal crimes in the upper part of the state will be made enormously more difficult. Additionally, under current law, the Federal Government is required to prosecute all felonies committed by Indians that occur on the Menominee Reservation. The reservation's distance from the Federal prosecutors and courts--more than 150 miles--makes these prosecutions problematic. And because the Justice Department compensates attorneys, investigators and sometimes witnesses for travel expenses, the existing system costs all of us. Without an additional judge in Green Bay, the administration of justice, as well as the public's pocketbook, will suffer enormously. 
   Fourth, many manufacturing and retail companies are located in northeastern Wisconsin. These companies often require a Federal court to litigate complex price-fixing, contract, and liability disputes with out-of-State businesses. But the sad truth is that many of these legitimate cases are never even filed --precisely because the northern part of the State lacks a Federal court. Mr. President, this hurts businesses not only in Wisconsin, but across the Nation. 
   Fifth, the creation of an additional judgeship in the Eastern District of Wisconsin is justified based on caseload. The Judicial Conference, the administrative and statistical arm of the Federal judiciary, makes biannual recommendations to Congress regarding the necessity of additional judgeships using a system of weighted filings--that is, the total number of cases 
   modified by the average level of case complexity. In the Judicial Conference's most recent recommendations, new positions were justified where a district's workload exceeded 435 weighted filings per judge. Such high caseloads are common in the eastern district of Wisconsin, peaking in 1996 with an overwhelming 453 weighted filings. On this basis, an additional judgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin is warranted. 
   Mr. President, our legislation is simple, effective and straightforward. It creates an additional judgeship for the eastern district, requires that one judge hold court in Green Bay, and gives the chief judge of the eastern district flexibility to designate which judge holds court there. And this legislation would increase the number of Federal district judges in Wisconsin for the first time since 1978. During that period, nearly 150 new Federal district judgeships have been created nationwide, but not a single one in Wisconsin.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of Barb Rabe, who retired after 29 years of service in the Oshkosh School District. She began her career in the Oshkosh School District in 1970 at the Perry Tipler Middle School as a Teachers Assistant, and then transferred to Oakwood Elementary School where she served for the next 27 years. During her years of service, Barb worked for six principals, adapting to each new principal's style, and was always actively involved as the staff grew from 12 to 42 and the student population grew from 200 to 500. She worked hard at creating partnerships with staff, students and families that would foster collaboration, cooperation and allegiance. Barb's strong work ethic, energy and enthusiasm will be missed. 
   While mastering the key elements of organization and flexibility, giving of her time and talent in serving the faculty and students of Oakwood School, and showing love and appreciation for students, she also came up with new ideas to adapt to the changing work environment. She developed the computerized milk and lunch money collection program at the school, which helped the school collect money more efficiently and thoroughly. She also purchased her own computer years before the school purchased them and took her work home to complete it in an organized fashion. When Oakwood School became computerized, she played an instrumental role in the conversion process. The students and staff of Oakwood will miss her professional and positive demeanor, although her husband of 45 years, Gordon, and their three sons and their families, will enjoy spending more time with her. Barb will be sorely missed by the entire Oakwood Elementary School community, however I extend my best wishes for a healthy, enriched and rewarding retirement.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment offered by my friend Senator WELLSTONE. Let me explain both why I support this amendment and why my support is somewhat qualified. 
   On the one hand, I agree that agricultural concentration is a problem which increasingly undermines the viability of family farms and negatively affects the well-being of our agricultural communities. On our Antitrust Subcommittee, we have watched with growing concern the wave of agricultural mergers and joint ventures in agriculture that have reduced the marketing options available to producers, and which may ultimately reduce--or may already have reduced--the prices they receive from the marketplace. While these merging corporations often contend that the mergers will result in better service for farmers and cost-savings for consumers, it's unclear whether that is true. And farmers face continued pressures from giant conglomerates against whom they have little bargaining power. 
   But, on the other hand, I am concerned that a blanket ban against all agricultural mergers would prevent those mergers that are pro-competitive as well as those that are undesirable. In addition, singling out a particular industry for merger moratoria, I fear, will lead to other calls for similar ``carve-outs.'' 
   Perhaps a better way to address the problem of consolidation in the agricultural industry is do what the administration has already promised. The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has given me a commitment that it will appoint a Special Counsel for agricultural antitrust issues--and it should do so expeditiously. This official will help ensure that agribusiness mergers no longer are a poor stepsister to mergers in the computer, telecom, finance, and media industries. 
   Mr. President, in moving a measure such as this one, we need to take care that we do not harm the very people we are trying to help. But until we see real signs that the administration is prepared to seriously scrutinize concentration in the agricultural industry, this approach is preferable to no action at all.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to explain briefly why I have held all legislation--including appropriations bills. It revolves around the issue of dairy pricing policies and dairy compacts. One is a national milk pricing system. I will explain that first and explain my concerns about what is happening. 
   There is a national milk pricing policy which has been in effect for about 60 years. It was set up in a way that said the further away you live from Wisconsin, if you are a dairy farmer, the more you get for your milk. The government set that policy up to encourage the formation of a national dairy industry because transportation--particularly refrigeration--was not available at that time. They said the further you live from Wisconsin, the more you get for your milk. That was 60 years ago. That kind of policy no longer makes any sense. 
   In lieu of and in consideration of that, the Secretary of Agriculture and the USDA have come up with a new pricing system which does not eliminate the differential. It simply reduces it. Ninety-seven percent of the farmers in our country voted for it. It was set to be implemented on October 1st. 
   Now we find out that the Republicans are apparently intending to go back to the old pricing system. That is a disaster for our country. It certainly is a disaster for Midwestern farmers, and it doesn't reflect the reality of our present-day system. 
   Again, farmers in the Midwest and from Wisconsin are not asking for any advantage. They simply want to have the same opportunities for marketing their product in a competitive way as dairy farmers all over the country. It seems to me that is a 
   reasonable request. 
   That is why we are so distressed at the impending outcome of what is going on in the House and will be here before the Senate very shortly. 
   The other one is the Northeast Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact seeks to set arbitrarily, without consideration for market activities, a price for their dairy farmers to sell their milk to processors. That price is generally higher than market prices. It makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for anybody else in other parts of the country to market their milk or their milk products in the Northeast Dairy Compact States--the New England States--because when the prices are arbitrarily decided, the processors are then obviously likely to buy their milk from the local farmer rather than to buy it from somebody in another State. 
   In effect, it excludes the opportunity to market your product--in this case milk--in the New England States. That is not only a disaster for us in the Midwest; it clearly is terrible national economic policy. 
   If it is allowed again to be renewed at this time--it expired in October--we would be endorsing a national policy which for the first time in the history of our country excludes products from being sold without interference in all 50 States. We have never done that before. The genius and the success of the  American system is based on our ability--no matter where we live in this country--to manufacture and sell products and services anywhere else in this country without restrictions. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact says, no; we are not going to do that anymore. 
   If we allow the Northeast to do that, then for what reason would we not allow other sections of the country to set up their own milk cartels, and for that matter, cartels on other products? If we allow it for the Northeast Dairy Compact, then I say unequivocally there is no justification for not allowing it elsewhere, not only on milk but on other products. 
   I ask my fellow Senators: Is this the way to run a country economically? Would any of us think we would endorse that kind of policy where States and regions can decide for themselves not to allow other products into those States or regions? 
   It doesn't make any sense. It is not the way we built the country. 
   We should not renew, therefore, the Northeast Dairy Compact at this time. 
   It was born 3 years ago in a back-room deal. There was no vote on the floor of the Senate. It was presented as part of a very large farm package. It was voted on in an affirmative way, but not by itself because it was part of a farm package 3 years ago. It is intended to be renewed again this year as part of a back-room deal without debate on the floor. It was debated twice all by itself. It lost on a straight up-and-down vote 3 or 4 years ago. The Northeast Dairy Compact lost on a cloture vote just several months ago. 
   I am very concerned about both things: The milk marketing pricing system, and the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am concerned enough to have a hold on all other legislation. 
   I hope very much that my fellow Senators can see the wisdom of my decision and support me in this effort not only to do what is right for Middle-Western dairy farmers but to do what is right for the people who live and work all over this country. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hutchinson/Brownback ``opt-out'' amendment, then vote for the Kohl/Sessions/Grassley $100,000 cap. Let me tell you why; an opt-out doesn't change a thing. A few states have already basically ``opted out'' of reasonable homestead exemptions and that's a problem. This amendment would let these states continue to go on like nothing happened. The Kohl-Sessions-Grassley amendment, on the other hand, will stop this abuse, pure and simple. 
   You can not support our cap and also support an opt-out: It's either one or the other, Mr. President. 
   They say this is really just about states' rights. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Anyone who files for bankruptcy is choosing to invoke federal law in a federal court to get a ``fresh start,'' which is a uniquely federal benefit. In these circumstances, it's only fair to impose federal limits. 
   And don't take my word for it: just listen to one of Texas' leading newspapers, the Austin American-Statesman. It recently editorialized that: ``The U.S. Constitution gives the federal government supremacy over the states in bankruptcy matters, so arguments that the federal government should let states do as the wish on this particular fact of bankruptcy law make little sense.'' The editorial goes on to urge Congress to limit the homestead exemption. 
   Besides, we're only capping the homestead exemptions in states like Florida and Texas as they apply to bankruptcy and not for other purposes. That is, if you lose a multi million-dollar lawsuit in Texas and can't ``pay-up,'' you can still keep your expensive home if you don't file for bankruptcy. While that may not seem right, what state courts do is a matter of state law--and we do not touch it. On the other hand, anyone who wants to take advantage of the federal bankruptcy system should live with a federal $100,000 cap. 
   Now let's turn to why our proposal is so important to effective bankruptcy reform. Our proposal closes an inexcusable loophole that allows too many debtors to keep their luxury homes, while their legitimate creditors--like children owed child support, ex-spouses owned alimony, state governments, small businesses and banks--get left out in the cold. Last year, the full Senate unanimously went on record in favor of the $100,000 cap and emphasized that ``meaningful bankruptcy reform cannot be achieved without capping the homestead exemption.'' 
   Curently, a handful of states allow debtors to protect their homes no matter how high their value. And all too often, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by moving expensive homes in states with unlimited exemptions like Florida and Texas, and declaring bankruptcy--and then continue to live in style. Let me give you a few of the literally countless examples: 
   The owners of a failed Ohio S&L, who was convicted of securities fraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still held on to the multi-million dollar ranch be bought in Florida. 
   A convicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owning at least $50 million in debts and fines, but still kept his $5 million Florida home--with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. 
   And just last year, movies star Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt through bankruptcy, but he still held into his $2.5 million Florida estate. 
   Unfortunately, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. We asked the GAO to study this problem and, based on their estimates, 400 homeowners in Florida and Texas--all with over one hundred thousand dollars in home equity--profit from this unlimited exemption each and every year. While they continue to live in luxury, they wrote off annually an estimated $120 million debt owned to honest creditors. 
   Mr. President, this is not only wrong, I believe it is not acceptable. Without our amendment, the pending bill falls far short. Instead of a cap, it only imposes a 2-year residency requirement to qualify for a State exemption. And while that is a step, it will not deter a savvy debtor who plans ahead for bankruptcy, and it won't do anything about instate abusers such as Burt Reynolds. This $100,000 cap will stop these abuses without affecting the vast majority of States. 
   Let me make one final point. Some opt-out supporters have circulated misleading information about how many States would be affected by this cap. While a few States would be impacted, they are mistaken about eight States in particular; they are: Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oregon, and Rhode Island. We asked the Congressional Research Service to take a look, and CRS concluded that our cap would have ``no effect'' on these States.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I do not think we should be misled by the Hutchison-Brownback amendment that it will save the family farm. No one has done more for family farmers, as we all know, than Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN, and they are supportive and cosponsors of our amendment. 
   Our amendment does have a specific exemption for farmers in each State so that the family farmer, whether they come from Texas, Iowa, or Wisconsin, can be specifically dealt with in that State in the event of a bankruptcy. 
   If we are serious about reform, now is the time to stop the most egregious abuse of our bankruptcy laws--by capping the homestead exemption and supporting the Kohl-Sessions-Grassley amendment. But don't take my word for it. Listen to voices from across the country. 
   For example, the New York Times recently editorialized that: ``Like a bill that passed the House, [the Senate bill] would do nothing to limit the ways that the formerly wealthy have of stiffing creditors, of which the unlimited homestead exemption is only the best known. . . . [If the bill] is to be passed, it should at least be amended to keep Texas and Florida from providing such blatant protection to once-wealthy deadbeats.'' 
   Of course, the New York Times may not be the most unbiased source. So I took a look at my home state paper, the Wisconsin State Journal. That newspaper says the same thing. According to its recent editorial, the House and Senate bankruptcy bills: ``deserve criticism for what they fail to include. Neither bill took a step toward closing the loophole that allows bankrupt' wealthy to shelter assets in an expensive home. Irresponsible but shrewd debtors sneak assets through bankruptcy via a provision permitting them to take advantage of state homestead exemptions.'' It adds that our $100,000 cap is a ``sound'' measure. 
   Finally, even leading papers from Texas and Florida--the two states most invested in this issue--find the case for reigning in the unlimited homestead exemption compelling. In an editorial earlier this year, the Austin American-Statesman praised the recent GAO report for pointing out  that the unlimited homestead exemption: ``[p]rimarily . . . is the refuge of a few high-living debtors, not the schoolteachers and small farmers it was intended to protect.'' 
   The Austin newspaper went on to dismiss appeals to states' rights as a false defense for the unlimited exemption, explaining that: ``The U.S. Constitution gives the federal government supremacy over the states in bankruptcy matters, so arguments that the federal government should let states do as they wish on this particular facet of bankruptcy law makes little sense.'' 
   Indeed, even this Texas opinion-maker is supportive of reform, declaring that: ``State officials in Austin and Washington should be at least willing to discuss limiting homestead protection. A few well-heeled and clever bankruptcy filers shouldn't be able to mess over a state law designed to protect average Texans. That mocks the state's much-celebrated populist image.'' 
   And the Tampa Tribune echoed these sentiments, complaining that the Senate bill does not go ``far enough toward closing the loophole that allows debtors unlimited homestead exemptions that protect the wealthiest from having to repay a significant portion of their debt.''

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, indeed, even Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN, who have cosponsored our $100,000 cap, also recognize that we are in the right, even though their home state of Iowa is one of the few states with an unlimited exemption. 
   Let me make one final point: some opt-out supporters, especially those from Texas, cite history as a justification for their position. But just because something has historical ``significance'' doesn't mean it's right. For example, we don't have debtors' prison anymore. We don't have sweatshops for children anymore. And Texas, as a matter of fact, is no longer part of Mexico. All of these changes altered something of ``historical significance;'' all were for the better. And getting rid of the unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy would also be a change--a dramatic change--for the better. 
   Mr. President, you can't support our cap and also support an opt-out: It's one or the other. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hutchison/Brownback amendment and to support our bipartisan $100,000 cap instead. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Privacy Protection Study Commission Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator TORRICELLI. This legislation addresses privacy protection by creating an expert Commission charged with the duty to explore privacy concerns. We cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. Privacy matters, and it will continue to matter more and more in this information age of high speed data, Internet transactions, and lightning-quick technological advances. 
   There exists a massive wealth of information in today's world, which is increasingly stored electronically. In fact, experts estimate that the average American is ``profiled'' in up to 150 commercial electronic databases. That means that there is a great deal of data--in some cases, very detailed and personal--out there and easily accessible courtesy of the Internet revolution. With the click of a button it is possible to examine all sorts of personal information, be it an address, a criminal record, a credit history, a shopping performance, or even a medical file. 
   Generally, the uses of this data are benign, even beneficial. Occasionally, however, personal information is obtained surreptitiously, and even peddled to third parties for profit or other uses. This is especially troubling when, in many cases, people do not even know that their own personal information is being ``shopped.'' 
   Two schools of thought exist on how we should address these privacy concerns. There are some who insist that we must do something and do it quickly. Others urge us to rely entirely on ``self-regulation''--according to them most companies will act reasonably and, if not, consumers will demand privacy protection as a condition for their continued business. 
   Both approaches have some merit, but also some problems. For example, even though horror stories abound about violations of privacy, Congress should not act by anecdote or on the basis of a few bad actors. Indeed, enacting ``knee-jerk,'' ``quick-fix'' legislation could very well do more harm than good. By the same token, however, self-regulation alone is unlikely to be the silver bullet that solves all privacy concerns. By itself, we have no assurance that it will bring the actors in line with adequate privacy protection standards. 
   Because it is better to do it right--in terms of addressing the myriad of complicated privacy concerns--than to do it fast, perhaps what is needed is a cooling off period. Such a ``breather'' will ensure that our action is based on a comprehensive understanding of the issues, rather than a ``mishmash'' of political pressures and clever soundbites. 
   For those reasons, and recognizing that there are no quick and easy answers, I suggest that we step back to consider the issue of privacy more thoughtfully. Let's admit that neither laws nor self-regulation alone may be the solution. Let's also concede that no one is going to divine the right approach overnight. But given the time and resources, a ``Privacy Protection Study Commission'' composed of experts drawn from the fields of law, civil rights and liberties, privacy matters, business, or information technology, may offer insights on how to address and ensure balanced privacy protection into the next millennium. 
   The bill I am introducing today would do just that. The Commission would be comprised of nine bright minds equally chosen by the Senate, the House, and the Administration. As drafted, the Commission will be granted the latitude to explore and fully examine the current complexities of privacy protection. After 18 months, the Commission will be required to report back to Congress with its findings and proposals. If legislation is necessary, the Commission will be in the best position to recommend a balanced course of action. And if lawmaking is not warranted, the Commission's recognition of that fact will help persuade a skeptical Congress and public. 
   This is not a brand new idea. Twenty-five years ago, Congress created a Privacy Protection Commission to study privacy concerns as they related to government uses of personal information. That Commission's findings were seminal. A quarter of a century later, because so much has changed, it is time to re-examine this issue on a much broader scale. The uses of personal information that concerned the Commission 25 years ago have exploded today, especially in this era of e-commerce, super databases, and mega-mergers. People are genuinely worried--perhaps they shouldn't be--but their concerns are real. 
   For example, a Wall Street Journal survey revealed that Americans today are more concerned about invasions of their personal privacy than they are  about world war. Another poll cited in the Economist noted that 80 percent are worried about what happens to information collected about them. William Afire summed it up best in a recent New York Times essay: ``We are dealing here with a political sleeper issue. People are getting wise to being secretly examined and manipulated and it rubs them the wrong way.'' 
   One final note: given that privacy is not an easy issue and that it appears in so many other contexts, I invite all interested parties to help us improve our legislation to create a Commission. We need to forge a middle ground consensus with our approach, and the door is open to all who share this goal.

   Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator DURBIN very much. 
   Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with Senator SESSIONS to eliminate one of the most flagrant abuses of the bankruptcy system--which is the unlimited homestead exemption. This bipartisan measure will cap the homestead exemption at $100,000, which is more than generous. Last year, the full Senate unanimously went on record in favor of the $100,000 cap and emphasized that ``meaningful bankruptcy reform cannot be achieved without capping the homestead exemption.'' I am proud that Senator GRASSLEY--the underlying bill's lead sponsor--is a cosponsor of this measure. Our proposal closes an inexcusable loophole that allows too many debtors to keep their luxury homes, while their legitimate creditors--like children owed child support, ex-spouses owed alimony, State governments, small businesses, and banks--get left out in the cold. Currently, a handful of States allow debtors to protect their homes no matter how high their value. And all too often, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by moving to expensive homes in states with unlimited exemptions like Florida and Texas, and declaring bankruptcy--and then continue to live in a style that is no longer appropriate. Let me give you a few of the literally countless examples: 
   The owner of a failed Ohio S&L, who was convicted of securities fraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still held on the multimillion dollar ranch he bought in Florida. A convicted Wall Street Financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least $50 million in debts and fines, but still he kept his $5 million Florida home--with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. And just last year, movie star Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt through bankruptcy, but he still held onto his $2.5 million Florida estate. 
   Sadly, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. We asked the GAO to study this problem and, based on their estimates, 4 homeowners in Florida and Texas--all with over $100,000 in home equity--profit from this unlimited exemption and each every year. And while they continue to live in luxury, they write off annually an estimated $120 million in debt that is owned to honest creditors. 
   My favorite GAO example is a Texas bankruptcy attorney who boasts of refusing representation to anyone who piles up credit card debt on the eve of filing bankruptcy. For that stand against abuse, she deserves credit. But when her own finances went sour, she took a dramatically different view: she wrote off $1.2 million in debt, while holding onto her $400,000 home. 
   Mr. President, this is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. As you can see, while the unlimited homestead exemption may not be the most common abuse of the bankruptcy system, it is clearly the most egregious. If we really want to restore the stigma attached to bankruptcy--as this bill purports to do--then these high profile cases are the best place to start. Mr. President, we need to stop this high living at the expense of legitimate creditors. But the pending bill falls short. Instead of a cap, it only imposes a 2 year residency requirement to qualify for a State exemption. And while that's a step, it will not deter a savvy debtor who plans ahead for bankruptcy and it will not do anything about in-state abusers such as Burt Reynolds. This $100,000 cap will stop these abuses, without affecting the great majority of States, two-thirds of which responsibly cap the exemption at $40,000 or less. 
   Let me make one additional point, and respond in advance to the most spurious--of the many spurious--arguments made by the other side: that this issue is really about States rights. Mr. President, that is pure hokum. Anyone who files for bankruptcy is choosing to invoke Federal law in a Federal court to get a uniquely Federal benefit--a  ``fresh start'' through a huge debt write-off. In these circumstances, it's only to impose Federal limits. And just because something is in a State ``constitution'' doesn't make it sacrosanct. A cap is not only the best policy, it is sends the best message: That bankruptcy is a tool of last resort, not just a tool for financial planning. And it gives credibility to reform by going after the worst abusers, no matter how wealthy they are. So honestly, this amendment should be a no-brainer. Indeed, if we want to apply antiquated bankruptcy laws, maybe we should resurrect ``the debtors' prison.'' At least then we would be punishing the worst offenders, rather than rewarding them.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999 and to commend Chairman HATCH for his efforts on this legislation. This measure would amend the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and make several changes to enhance the merger review process undertaken by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. We believe that reforms to this statute are long overdue--the threshold hasn't been changed since the statute's enactment in 1976--but we also view the proposals in this legislation as a starting point, and not necessarily the last word on this subject. 
   The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is crucial to the enforcement of competition policy in today's economy--it ensure that the antitrust agencies have sufficient time to review mergers and acquisitions prior to their completion. The statute requires that, prior to consummating a merger or acquisition of a certain minimum size, the companies involved must formally notify the antitrust agencies and must provide certain information regarding the proposed transaction. For those transactions covered by the Act, the parties to a merger or acquisition may not close their transaction until the expiration of a thirty day waiting period after making their Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. This waiting period may be extended by the antitrust agencies requesting additional information from the parties to the transaction in which case, under current law, the parties may not complete the deal until twenty days after supplying the government with the requested information. 
   While this statute has a very laudable purpose, especially with the tremendous numbers of mergers and acquisitions taking place in recent years, some of its provisions are in need of revision. Most importantly, while inflation has caused the value of a dollar to drop by more than a half in the past 25 years, the monetary test that subjects a transaction to the provisions of the statute has not been revised since the law's enactment in 1976. As a result, many transactions that are of a relatively small size and pose little antitrust concerns are nevertheless swept  into the ambit of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process. This legislation would raise the size of transaction covered by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from $15 million to $35 million. This will both lessen the agencies' burden of reviewing small transactions unlikely to seriously affect competition and enable the agencies to allocate their resources to properly focus on those transactions most worthy of scrutiny. Further, exempting smaller transactions from the Hart-Scott-Rodino process will significantly lessen regulatory burdens and expenses imposed on small businesses. The parties to these smaller transactions will no longer need to pay the $45,000 filing fee--or face the often even more onerous legal fees and other expenses typically incurred in preparing a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing--for mergers and acquisitions that usually don't pose any competitive concerns. 
   In exempting this class of transactions from Hart-Scott-Rodino review, however, it is important that we not cause the antitrust agencies to lose the funding they need to carry out their increasingly demanding mission of enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. Therefore, we have attempted to ensure that our measure is revenue-neutral--indeed, it would raise filing fees for transactions valued at over $100,000,000, which makes sense because these transactions require more scrutiny. In considering this legislation, of course, we will need to carefully study the budgetary implications of this reform to ensure that our goal of revenue-neutrality has been met. As this measure moves forward, however, we ought to consider whether bigger deals of, say, $1 billion or $10 billion and over should require higher fees. 
   This legislation makes other changes designed to enhance the efficiency of the pre-merger review process. The waiting period has been extended from twenty to thirty days after the parties' compliance with the government's request for additional information, a more realistic waiting period 
   in this era of increasingly complex mergers generating enormous amounts of relevant information and documents. As in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a deadline for action occurs on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is extended to the next business day. This simple provision will eliminate gamesmanship by parties who currently may time their compliance so that the waiting period ends on a weekend or holiday, effectively shortening the waiting period to the previous business day. 
   Mr. President, some have expressed concerns regarding the difficulties and expense imposed on business in complying with allegedly overly burdensome or duplicative government requests for additional information. So we believe that it is reasonable to consider methods to prevent abuse of this process by overbroad or unreasonable requests. Therefore, this legislation includes provisions to amend the statute to add a right of appeal to a U.S. Magistrate Judge to adjudicate disputes regarding the propriety of government requests for additional information. We have not reached any final conclusions regarding the wisdom of these provisions; they are certainly worth ``floating'' as ideas, and the process will determine if they should be included as part of a final product. Further, we should keep in mind that if this right of appeal provision is enacted it will impose significant additional litigation burdens on the antitrust agencies which might require a corresponding increase in funding for these agencies. Our goal, again, is to improve the functioning of the pre-merger review system which is so vital to antitrust enforcement and, in that context, this provision deserves at least a supportive ``look.'' 
   Mr. President, let me make one additional point. We recognize that all will not agree with the necessity or efficacy of all of these reform proposals. We are, of course, willing to consider any modification to this legislation that will advance our goals of a more efficient merger review process. But virtually everyone agrees that Hart-Scott-Rodino needs to be updated and we're pleased that this measure moves us forward.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this bill was not an easy bill for me to support. While I believe that fostering trade with our neighbors leads to growth both here and abroad, I also know that some companies use trade to take advantage of foreign low wage workers. I had hoped that this bill would take stronger measures to ensure that labor and environmental rights received greater respect. 
   I opposed cloture initially on this bill because it would unfairly limit the ability to improve the bill. After an agreement was worked out to allow trade related amendments, I decided to support cloture to move the legislation forward. I supported amendments that would have required labor and environmental agreements and stricter oversight of imports to avoid trans-shipment. I was disappointed that these amendments were not agreed to, but I encourage the conferees to continue fighting for these important issues. 
   Some important changes were made. The Senate included a provision to help our farmers cope with the negative effects of trade agreements. This Trade Adjustment Assistance for farmers parallels the Trade Adjustment Assistance program that has helped so many industrial workers. Senator HARKIN offered an amendment that will go a long way toward eliminating child labor in these developing countries if they hope to take advantage of the benefits in this legislation. This provision makes the bill more humane, and reflects our moral values, not just our economic interests. 
   While the bill is not perfect, increasing opportunity for some of the poorest countries is an important goal and deserves the support of the Senate. The countries of the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa know that trade and investment coupled with aid programs are more effective than foreign aid alone. The countries involved support this bill and look forward to a chance to sell their products in our market. 
   The struggle for labor standards is a long road, but that journey cannot start if people do not have jobs. There is no way to improve working conditions for the unemployed. Only when trade and investment bring jobs to these countries will workers be able to organize and fight for better conditions. Many of these countries are new democracies that have much to learn about the benefits of protecting their workers. We should remember that the United States is a democracy that is 225 years old, and that the backbone of our labor laws are only 65 years old. Those laws did not come easily. There was a long, bitter, and sometimes bloody fight before the United States saw the wisdom of protecting workers rights. We need to continue our efforts, both at the government and non-governmental level, to convince these countries to follow our example. Unfortunately, our trade negotiators have only recently come to the conclusion that labor rights matter to workers here and abroad. 
   Making access to the U.S. market difficult is not going to improve the lot of workers in Africa and the Caribbean. The more we do to engage these countries and improve the climate for investment, the closer these countries get to moving out of poverty and toward prosperity.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Antitrust Technical Corrections and Improvements Act of 1999 with my colleague MIKE DEWINE. This act makes five miscellaneous technical corrections to the antitrust laws. Companion legislation to this bill has been introduced in the House by Representatives HYDE and CONYERS. 
   One of the technical corrections repeals an outdated provision which applies only to the Panama Canal, one clarifies a long existing ambiguity and expressly ensures that the Sherman Act applies to the District of Columbia and the territories, and another repeals a redundant jurisdictional provision. In addition, two other provisions correct typographical errors in two antitrust statutes--the inadvertent mislabeling of an amendment to the Clayton Act passed last year and another a punctuation error in the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. 
   The only difference between our bill and the House companion is that the House would repeal an outdated statute--the Taking Depositions in Public Act--which requires that pre-trial depositions in antitrust cases brought by the government be taken in public. This provision was enacted in 1913 at a time when antitrust cases were tried under completely different procedures from today and testimony was usually not taken in open court. In other words, back then antitrust trials were essentially conducted ``on paper.'' This statute was virtually ignored--and unused--until the past year. This provision was revived last year when, as part of its antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, the government deposed Bill Gates. 
   Now, of course, people need to be deposed if they possess evidence that may be integral to the resolution of the case. But today the 1913 statute seems both unnecessary, counter-productive and, even, voyeuristic--that is, if you can have voyeurism in an antitrust context. Its need has vanished because testimony is now taken in open court in antitrust cases, as it is in any other. Indeed, requiring the depositions of prominent figures such as Bill Gates and Steve Case in controversial and widely publicized cases inevitably creates a media ``feeding frenzy'' contrary to the sound administration of justice and a sober examination of complicated legal issues. 
   So I would support the House provision but, at this point, my belief is that it is more important to move the underlying measure in a timely manner than to wait to develop a consensus on the deposition provision in the Senate. We'll work on that consensus here, or we'll work the differences out in conference.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to register my support for meaningful campaign finance reform. I will be voting today for cloture on the Daschle amendment which is the broader version of campaign finance reform passed by the House, including provisions to limit issue advocacy advertising during campaigns. Should we have a vote on the Reid amendment, I will also be voting for cloture on a ban on so-called soft money contributions to political parties. Although I was unavoidably absent from the Senate during yesterday's vote, I would have voted against the motion to table the Reid amendment banning soft money contributions. 
   Banning of soft money is the least we can do. This unlimited flow of money into party coffers creates the greatest opportunity for special interests to seek favor with politicians. The reality that businesses or organizations can be tapped for such vast sums has dramatically changed the atmosphere surrounding the work of our legislative and executive branches of government. Even responsible voices in business have said that they want out from this unseemly competition. The Committee for Economic Development, a group of 200 senior executives and college presidents, has put forward its own campaign finance proposal, mirroring many of the ideas we have discussed over the last few days, stating, ``As business leaders, we are troubled by the mounting pressure for businesses to contribute to the campaigns their competitors support, as well as the dangers that real or perceived political corruption pose for business and the economy.'' 
   Whether the presence of unlimited political contributions is corrupting or whether it just creates the appearance of corruption, the damage is done. Americans are disaffected with politics and political campaigns and have voted  against the current system with their feet: U.S. voter turnout in elections is in serious decline. According to the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, over the last 30 years we have witnessed a 26 percent decline in voter participation. Fifty-four percent of voting age adults reported voting in the last Presidential election in 1996, the lowest level since the Census Bureau began collecting these statistics in 1964. And these statistics may not even tell the whole story, with some citizens unwilling to admit they did not vote. The official statistics maintained by the Clerk of the House measured voter turnout in 1996 at 49.8 percent. For non-Presidential election years, the numbers are even more discouraging. During the 1998 elections, we witnessed the lowest voter turnout since 1942. 
   Our representative democracy is harmed by eroding participation. As elected officials we have a responsibility to try to address the sources of voter disaffection. According to the Census Bureau, 17 percent of non-voting registered individuals reported they did not vote because of apathy. That number was up from 11 percent in 1980. In response, we should be working to help reconnect the voters with their elected officials and to invest them in the political debates of the day. Campaign finance reform, in one form or another, is an important part of that process. However, there is more we can be doing to bring citizens back to the polls and to engage them in the issues facing our country. We must be clearly responsive to our constituents and not the special interests who often seem to have a stranglehold on the political process. Unfortunately, there are far too many bills which have the fingerprints of special interests all over them. We must take back the process from the special interests and craft bills beholden to no one but our constituents. 
   We should also be working to eliminate barriers to voting. Nearly 5 million registered voters said they did not make it to the polls in 1996 because they couldn't get time off from work or school to vote. In response, we need to explore ways to make it easier for Americans to cast their ballots, and we need to do so in a way that does not encourage voter fraud. One such approach which merits 
   further consideration is longer voting hours at the polls. 
   In the past I have introduced legislation to study the possibility of extending voting hours across the weekend. If polls were open on Saturday and Sunday, people would have more than enough time to vote. Since the mid-19th century we have held election day on the first Tuesday in November, ironically because it was the most convenient day for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally ``court day'' and landowning voters were often coming to town that day anyway. We need to consider the national rhythms of today and determine what framework for voting makes the most sense for the American people. 
   While weekend voting may pose some challenges, others have recommended that we require the states to keep the polling stations open from early in the morning until late in the evening on election day. This more limited proposal would be less costly and more manageable for states and would also provide more opportunities for people to vote. 
   We should consider proposals to create a national voter leave, perhaps just two hours on election day to enable workers to make it to the polls. I am also intrigued by proposals to allow the disabled to vote by telephone, and we should be investigating how we can make use of the internet to make registration and voting easier. 
   The internet is already ushering in a new era in elections, bringing new meaning to the issue of transparency in the financing of political campaigns. Until now, disclosure has been one of the cornerstones of campaign finance reform. The disinfectant of sunshine has always been heralded as a means of keeping politics clean. However, in this era of instant posting of campaign contributions, we are seeing an interesting side effect. The very tool to limit the role of special interests in politics is also highlighting that role and adding to the disaffection of voters. While it is important for us to continue to shine a spotlight on campaign contributions, we must recognize that disclosure is not enough. Ultimately, meaningful campaign finance reform and other efforts to increase voter motivation are the keys to bringing citizens back into the polling booth. Elections are essential to maintaining a robust democracy. Looking at the fragile democracies around the world reminds us that the right to elect our own leaders is a precious right--most valuable if it is exercised. 
   Mr. President, whether we pass campaign finance reform today or at some point in the future, I want to acknowledge the hard work of my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator RUSS FEINGOLD in moving this issue forward. Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN have persisted in raising campaign finance reform in the face of opposition from a minority determined to block reform. I will continue to support their efforts and look forward to the day when all Americans recognize that they have a stake in our society and are motivated to exercise their civic duty to vote.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators HATCH, LEAHY, GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, and SCHUMER in introducing the Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999. Our bipartisan measure will help give back to Federal judges the authority they need to handle multiple, overlapping cases as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
   This legislation essentially overturns the Supreme Court's decision in Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998). In that case, the Supreme Court rejected 30 years of practice during which trial courts overseeing related cases for consolidated pretrial proceedings had been permitted to retain jurisdiction of those cases for trial. That long-standing routine made plain common sense, because oversight by one court (instead of dozens of courts) is often the best use of resources, regardless of whether the parties are still in discovery or already at trial. Indeed, a consolidated trial may not only be more convenient for the parties and the witnesses, but it also promotes justice by keeping the case before a judge who is already familiar with the underlying facts.  
   Let me just point out that I do not mean to criticize the Supreme Court's decision as a matter of law. It may well be that the original Multidistrict Litigation statute was too narrowly drafted, and ultimately it is the responsibility of Congress to write--or, in this case, rewrite--the law to make sure it says what Congress intends. 
   While this measure is an important step forward, we must recognize that it is just that--a step. There is much more we can do to promote efficiency and fairness in litigation for both victims and defendants. In fact, the proposal to overturn Lexecon was first raised publicly at a hearing on class action reform in the House early last year, as just one of several proposals that would help ensure the fair administration of justice. Ironically, while this measure appears to be on the fast track, we continue to delay consideration of the other more pressing class action measures that were the focus of that hearing. And, while consolidation could be particularly valuable in the class action context, without class action reforms this bill actually won't affect most class actions. The reason is simple: while this bill only applies to cases filed in Federal court, most class actions--even ones that are nationwide in scope and shape nationwide policies--end up in State court. 
   Indeed, increased consolidation would help eliminate one of the most significant class action abuses--that is, the dangerous ``race to settlement'' among competing cases. Currently, overlapping class actions involving the same parties and the same claims put rival class lawyers in competition to get the first--and only--settlement available. The result is all too common: one lawyer lines his pockets with huge fees by taking a quickie settlement, while the class gets the short end of the stick. For example, in one instance involving overlapping Federal and State actions, the class lawyers who brought the State case negotiated a small settlement precluding all other suits, and even agreed to settle federal claims that were not at issue in State court. Meanwhile, the Federal court was outraged, finding that the Federal claims could have been worth more than $1 billion, while accusing the State class lawyers of ``hostile representation'' that ``surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of subversion'' and of having ``more in line with the 
   interests of [defendants] than those of their clients.'' 
   This danger was recently underscored by the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules Report on Mass Tort Litigation, which found that ``[T]he risk is considerable that speedy justice may be converted into speedy injustice ..... if two or more courts enter a race to be first to achieve a disposition binding on all courts.'' The report added that, ``This risk is aggravated by the `reverse auction' scenario ..... , in which a defendant may play would-be class representatives off against each other, bidding down the terms of settlement to the lowest level that can win approval by the most complaisant available court.'' This race to settlement, or ``reverse auction,'' shortchanges legitimate victims, while allowing blameworthy defendants to get off easy. 
   Mr. President, we can prevent abuses like this--and encourage efficiency--simply by permitting more overlapping nationwide class actions to be brought into Federal court, the only place where the consolidation procedure is available. Once the cases are consolidated, lead counsel will be appointed, making it impossible to shop around low-priced settlements and to pit competing class lawyers against each other. However, as long as these class actions can be kept in various State courts, this bill won't succeed in bringing consolidation to the complex cases that need it most. 
   That's one of the principal reasons why Senator GRASSLEY and I introduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 (S. 353) earlier this year. Our proposal, which among other provisions allows more nationwide class actions to be removed to Federal court, would--in conjunction with the bill we are introducing today--help eliminate the race to settlement in most class actions, save court resources and promote efficiency by placing related class actions before one court. A similar measure has already passed the House, and we look forward to moving this measure ahead in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today in offering our proposal to return to Federal courts the authority they need to consider multiple, overlapping cases in a fair, expeditious and just manner. This is a necessary step in the direction of real reform, and I hope it will build momentum for more comprehensive reform, like the Grassley/Kohl Class Action Fairness Act.

   Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague, Senator COCHRAN, in support of the conference report to H.R. 1906, the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I congratulate Senator COCHRAN, chairman of the subcommittee, for guiding us past many obstacles that have stood in the way of final passage of this measure. At the end of today's debate, we will send to the President an agricultural spending bill that will result in immediate aid to hundreds of thousands of farmers across our country. That is an accomplishment of which we can all be proud. 
   At times, work on this bill was contentious. The money we had available to work with made it very difficult to fund adequately the most critical programs at USDA, FDA, and the other agencies in this bill. 
   Senator COCHRAN did a masterful job in finding a balance of priorities, given the budgetary constraints under which we had to work. In fact, we were even able to increase spending for some critical programs. This conference report provides an increase for the President's food safety initiative, as well as additional funds to help avoid a shortfall in inspectors at the Food Safety Inspection Service. An increase is provided for the WIC Program to help maintain caseload. Other programs, such as research and education, conservation and rural development are all funded at a very healthy level. 
   Most important, we have managed to include $8.7 billion in emergency aid to farmers suffering from the price collapse that has hit too many commodities. I realize some of my colleagues, especially those from the Northeast, will argue that more is needed to address the needs of farmers suffering from the effects of this summer's drought and Hurricane Floyd. I agree. The administration should send us a separate emergency request for these recent disasters, and Congress ought to act on it immediately. But our commitment to help the farmers of the Northeast overcome the natural disasters of the last several months should not stop us from enacting aid for farmers all over the country suffering from the economic disasters of the last several years. 
   I also want to note the efforts made to ensure that harmful legislative riders, such as attempts to undermine USDA reform of dairy policy, did not become part of this conference report. We have spent months putting together a fair bill--not perfect, but fair. Efforts to incorporate dairy compacts into this legislation were defeated more than once. It is time to pass this bill and get much-needed funding to dairy farmers and to hardworking farmers across the country. 
   And let me emphasize that last point. This bill contains almost $9 billion in emergency assistance to struggling farmers everywhere. Within days of the President signing the bill, almost $5 billion of that aid will be on its way to farmers. It is all well and good for us to spend days listening to talk about this money--how it is distributed and how much there should be--but there are hundreds of thousands of farmers who need it now to plant, feed, and operate. All the words in the world will not help farmers get next year's crop in the ground or milk the cows. We have talked enough--it is time now to pass this bill. 
   In closing, let me say how much I have enjoyed working with Senator COCHRAN. This is my first year as ranking member on this subcommittee and his exceptional leadership, good judgment, and helpful hand has been indispensable in making this a positive experience for all of us. I would also like to thank his distinguished staff, Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Les Spivey, and Hunt Shipman, for their important contributions to this bill. And, of course, I must thank Galen Fountain of the minority staff for his wisdom and patience. Galen is an invaluable resource to me, to all Democratic Senators, and to the Senate itself.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If two-thirds of this body fails to ratify the treaty, we are squandering a unique opportunity to make the world a safer place for our children. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is really quite simple: It bans all nuclear explosives testing for weapons or any other purposes. This treaty does not ban nuclear weapons. We currently have some 6,000 nuclear weapons in our arsenal. Nothing in this treaty requires us to give up these weapons. Nor does the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty require us to limit our own nuclear testing in a way that we have not already chosen to do unilaterally. Yet, opponents of the treaty have painted a picture of dire consequences and doom that requires a response. 
   The history of the 20th century is replete with lessons about the danger posed to us by nuclear weapons. Those of us who remember when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of World War II are vividly aware of the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear arms are not a dry topic for policy debate. They are devastating weapons that have been used and could be used again by any nation that currently possesses nuclear weapons or the capability to develop them. 
   It was not so long ago that we were in the midst of a nuclear arms race during the Cold War. Those of us who remember the Cuban missile crisis and the palpable fear that swept across the country at that time are well aware of the dangerous potential for a crisis to escalate between nations with nuclear capabilities. Yet in the midst of the Cold War, we were able to negotiate the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty which prohibits nuclear explosions for weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space and under water. 
   Must we be on the brink of crisis or engaged in another arms race to recognize the value of a nuclear test ban treaty? The Berlin Wall may have fallen and the Cold War may be over but the possibility of new and threatening nuclear powers emerging in the next century must still inform our national security policy. Our formidable stockpile of weapons may serve as a deterrent to the current nuclear weapon states, but far more frightening is the prospect of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of a rogue nation or terrorist organization. 
   There is no question that a world without nuclear weapons is a safer one. However, we have long moved beyond that point. Rather, we have pursued--for the most part in a bipartisan fashion--arms control agreements and policies to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Thus, it defies logic that the Senate would not embrace this tool to help us ensure that there are fewer nuclear weapons and fewer advanced nuclear weapons. Without nuclear explosive testing, those attempting to acquire new nuclear weapons cannot be confident that these weapons will work as intended. Banning testing is tantamount to banning the development of nuclear weapons. 
   Since the signing of the CTBT treaty, 154 states have signed the treaty and 51 have ratified it. A smaller group of 44 states which have nuclear power reactors or nuclear research reactors and are members of the Conference on Disarmament are required to ratify the treaty for it to go into force. Of this group, 41 have signed the treaty and 26 have ratified it. Today, only five countries are nuclear weapons states and only three countries are considered to be nuclear ``threshold'' states. Limiting nuclear explosive testing is the key to keeping the number of nuclear weapon states down. 
   For those of my colleagues who see no value in pursuing arms control and policies to limit the development of nuclear weapons--weapons that one day may be directed toward us or our allies I say that you are out of step with the American people. Arms control does not compromise our national  security: it bolsters it. Polling on this issue and other arms control issues indicate that the American people recognize that we are safer if there are fewer nuclear arms in the world, especially when we continue to have the most robust conventional and nuclear forces in the world. 
   Indeed, the CTBT locks in our nuclear superiority, for it is the U.S. government that has conducted more nuclear explosive tests than any other nation. We are integrating the knowledge acquired during our 1000-plus tests with ongoing non-nuclear testing and the science-based Stockpile Stewardship program to monitor the reliability of our weapons. Although some critics have described this approach as risky and incomplete, the three directors of our nuclear weapons labs have all affirmed that this approach is sufficient to maintain the safety and reliability of our stockpile. And, they will continue to review these findings on an annual basis. 
   Should the lab directors be unable to vouch for the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, I have no doubt that they will advise the President accordingly. For the safeguards package accompanying the treaty, and reflecting current U.S. policy relative to the treaty, states that the CTBT is conditioned on:  
   The understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command--that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.  
   In fact, opponents argue that this treaty cannot restrain nations from testing nuclear weapons because there is nothing to prevent nations from withdrawing from the treaty. That is the case, of course, for all international treaties. While there are no guarantees that this treaty will stop nations from testing, signing the CTBT makes it more difficult for a nation to conduct nuclear tests. A nation must balance its desire to conduct nuclear tests with the likelihood it will be subject to international condemnation. Will we be able to overcome international pressure should the President be advised that we need to conduct nuclear explosive tests again? I am hopeful we will never reach that point, but given the willingness of some members to reject this treaty today, I don't believe that international pressure will prevent us from heeding the advice of our nation's nuclear weapons experts. 
   We have heard much over the last few days from those who say that we should reject the CTBT because the treaty is not verifiable. Yes, there are some nuclear tests we will not be able to verify, particularly at the lowest levels. This would be the case whether the treaty was in force or not. 
   There is a strong case to be made, however, that tests difficult to verify are at low enough levels to render them militarily insignificant. Treaty opponents also neglect to mention that we are worse off in our ability to monitor nuclear testing around the world without the CTBT. As Secretary Cohen stated in his testimony to the Armed Services Committee last week, ``I think that our capacity to verify tests will be enhanced and increased under the treaty by virtue of the fact that we'd have several hundred more monitoring sites across the globe that will aid and assist our national technical means.'' 
   If we fail to ratify the CTBT not only are we squandering an opportunity to advance our own national security interests by limiting nuclear testing, but we are at risk of undermining everything we have achieved until now to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. As Paul Nitze, President Reagan's arms control negotiator, explained:  
   If the CTBT is not ratified in a timely manner it will gravely undermine U.S. non-proliferation policy. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the primary tool for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, was made permanent in 1995 based on a firm commitment by the United States and the other nuclear weapon states to negotiate a CTBT by 1996. Violation of the spirit, if not the letter of this NPT related commitment of 1995 could give nations an excuse to withdraw from the Treaty, potentially causing the NPT regime to begin to erode and allowing fears of widespread acquisition of nuclear weapons by many nations to become reality. 
   By taking away the most significant weapon in the battle to prevent their spread, failure to ratify the CTBT would fundamentally weaken our national security and facilitate the spread of nuclear weapons. Instead of being a leader in the fight against nuclear proliferation, the United States would have itself struck a blow against the NPT.  
   Our military leaders have also been advocates for the CTBT. The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Mr. Nitze's remarks when he said in his testimony last week, ``The CTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In short, the world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the CTBT treaty.'' Four of the previous five chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff support our ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   The CTBT is not the product of one administration. Rather it is the culmination of the work and ideas of several administrations. The decision to place a moratorium on nuclear testing was first made in 1992, by President George Bush when he announced a five-year moratorium on tests to develop new warheads, and then when he signed legislation containing the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment banning nuclear testing for at least one year. That testing moratorium has been maintained by President Clinton. And, none of the major presidential candidates have said that they are prepared to end this moratorium and begin conducting nuclear tests. 
   This treaty is not a Democratic treaty: It was President Eisenhower who said that the failure to achieve a nuclear test ban was one of greatest disappointments of his administration. And it was President Eisenhower who said, ``This Government has stood, throughout, for complete abolition of weapons testing subject only to the attainment of agreed and adequate methods of inspection and control.'' Mr. President, that day has arrived. 
   This treaty is an American achievement. It was American determination and leadership that brought the CTBT negotiations to conclusion, and it is American leadership which invigorates international arms control efforts in general. I support these efforts. 
   The debate we are having is being watched around the world. Our allies are dumbfounded that we are on the verge of defeating the CTBT and so am I. 
   I deplore the partisanship which has underscored this debate. This treaty is not about politics. I urge my colleagues to review the merits of this treaty in a non-partisan fashion. It is clear from the partisan divide that this issue is very much caught up in the politics of this institution. So, I wish we had put off further debate and a vote on ratification for another day and give the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the unbiased scrutiny it deserves.

   Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the view of the Senators from Michigan and California regarding this issue. For many years, I too have grown concerned by the trend away from healthy food choices and toward eating patterns that may lead to tremendous health care costs in the future. To the extent that human health is a result or human choices, there is probably no better example than in what we choose to eat. 
   In my opinion, American consumers receive too much persuasion regarding diet from our popular culture and far too little from those best qualified to provide good counsel. In the instance of the matter raised by the Senator from Michigan, I am not sure what benefits to public policy are achieved by an never ending discussion within political circles where expertise in human nutrition is probably lacking. Does this send a good strong message to the American consumer regarding the right choices to make regarding nutrition? I hardly think so. 
   It is time, it is long time, for politicians to step back and let the experts decide what is best for the American consumer. The Senator from Michigan makes some valid points regarding the need for a common sense approach to nutrition and public health. I hope the Department of agriculture recognizes that their responsibly transcends the political winds where some matters, such as sound nutritional advice, have no place. I would not expect doctors at the Mayo Clinic to take my advice on how to proceed with a delicate operation. Further, I would not expect nutrition experts at USDA to take my advice on what details best constitute a totally balance diet for a certain population beyond my suggestion that they use their best judgement base don their knowledge and experience. If they don't follow those standards it is unclear why they are there in the first place.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be voting against the fiscal year 2000 Foreign Operations appropriations bill conference report. Although I supported this bill when it came through the Senate, I was hopeful that during the conference we would find the resources to address the serious deficiencies in this bill. Unfortunately, that was not the case and we have before us a bill that dramatically cuts the Administration's request for foreign operations by 14 percent. 
   At a time of great uncertainty around the world, when we are being called on to foster new democracies, support peacekeeping operations, prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and provide critical support for the ongoing Middle East peace process, we have before us a bill which threatens to undermine many of these vital foreign policy interests. If we nickel and dime our foreign policy priorities now, we will pay a higher price down the road when we respond to the ensuing international crises. 
   I have generally supported our foreign aid budget. It is a less than one percent of our annual budget, a small amount to protect our national interests and provide tremendous benefit to those in need. In the past, however, when our spending contributed to burgeoning deficits, I opposed foreign aid or for that matter any spending bill that surpassed the spending levels of the previous year. However, in this era of budget surpluses the debate has shifted to a question of priorities. And, it is in this context that I must oppose this bill. We cannot afford to give short shrift to basic priorities traditionally funded in this bill. It is my hope that after the President vetoes this bill, we produce a bipartisan foreign operations budget that can be supported by all.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for their good efforts and sense of fairness in putting together the VA-HUD Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. We all agree that this year's attempts to stay within the spending caps has forced us all to make some tough choices and to work that much harder to reach consensus and complete our appropriations work in a timely and responsible manner. Senators BOND and MIKULSKI are to be commended for their hard work. 
   I would ask for a clarification on a point of concern for my constituents in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As you know, the VA-HUD bill contains funds in support of several important economic development initiatives in Wisconsin, including both the Metcalfe Neighborhood and Menomonee Valley Redevelopment projects in Milwaukee. I am pleased that the Committee has expressed support for both projects, but would simply ask if the Chairman and Ranking Member would have any objection to shifting the amount of funds distributed between these projects during the conference negotiations. In other words, would you have any objection to shifting funds designated for the Menomonee Valley project to the Metcalfe Neighborhood project? I ask for this clarification in order to allow the City of Milwaukee the flexibility to reallocate the funds provided in keeping with its economic development needs and timeframes for project completion.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Ted Stewart, as any other nominee, deserves a vote. And eventually, I expect to vote for him, because I respect the judgment of my friend ORRIN HATCH and of the President. But there is a long line of qualified nominees ahead of him and, at least at this point, it's not right for him to ``cut'' in line. 
   For example, just compare Mr. Stewart's path with that of another qualified candidate, Tim Dyk, a nominee for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Dyk was first nominated 18 months ago, came out of Committee with strong bipartisan support, then stalled on the floor in the last days of the session because of a ``secret'' hold. He was nominated again eight months ago, and he has still never been placed on the agenda. 
   As for Mr. Stewart, he was nominated less than two months ago, and it took him just 48 hours to go from nomination, to hearing, to Committee approval. Now Mr. Stewart is up for a full Senate vote just 53 days after he was nominated. Meanwhile, five hundred and two days after Tim Dyk was nominated, he seems to be going nowhere fast. 
   That makes no sense to me or, I suspect, to Chairman HATCH, who also supports this nominee. 
   Mr. President, as with Mr. Stewart, Mr. Dyk will, I predict, be confirmed with bipartisan support. He's a first-rate intellect. He passed this Committee by a 14 to 4 vote last year, and all of us know that the Federal Circuit would be lucky to have someone of his caliber. 
   Like Tim Dyk and Ted Stewart, there are many other deserving nominees out there. Let's not play favorites. These nominees, who have to put their lives on hold waiting for us to act, deserve an ``up or down'' vote. And, more importantly, the American people deserve prompt action, so that our courts can stay on top of their workload, and continue putting criminals behind bars. 
   So, Mr. President, I expect to support Ted Stewart, but don't think he alone should get the timely consideration that all nominees--including Tim Dyk, Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez--deserve. So I hope we can get an agreement to move forward not only Mr. Stewart, but also other deserving nominees. Thank you.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would compensate a company that built a school building for the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe in my state of Wisconsin. It would also clarify ownership of the building. The educational program of the school, as well as the operation and maintenance funding are provided to the Tribe through a grant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   When a number of classrooms were condemned, the BIA provided a grant to the school to lease temporary space while the classrooms were replaced. Rather than lease space, the Tribe entered into a lease/purchase agreement with a contractor for construction of an 8,400 square foot building. When the  Bureau learned that the Tribe had not used the initial grant payment to lease space, they declined to provide additional money to the tribe for this project since the BIA was, at the same time, providing about $2 million for the tribe to replace the condemned classrooms. All of this and more is detailed in an audit report issued by Interior's Inspector General last March. 
   It is my understanding that this amendment will have no impact on construction projects which are to begin in fiscal year 2000. To that end, I would urge the chairman to call on BIA to identify before conference any potential negative impact associated with this amendment.

As they have noted, there is some significant research being conducted by the Forest Service, vital to forest health management and forest productivity that the Committee supports. Am I correct in my understanding that it was the Committee's intention in its discussion of Forest Service research in the Committee's report to maintain for fiscal year 2000 the forest products utilization research and supporting research activities conducted at the Forest Products Lab in Madison, Wisconsin, at the fiscal year 1999 funding level?

   Mr. KOHL. Cutting these research programs would dramatically decrease the Nation's ability to conserve scarce forest resources. It would eliminate work on major research issues in western softwood forests and in eastern hardwoods. Forest products research defrays forest management costs, increases fiber availability to meet the Nation's need for wood and fiber, speeds the acceptance of new and more efficient utilization technologies, and enhances the development of technologies that will restore economic vitality to forest-dependent communities. Curbing forest product research would also eliminate technical expertise on wood use, particularly in the area of housing.

   Mr. KOHL. I rise to engage the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from Washington, Senator GORTON, in a colloquy on an item in the Forest Service budget which needs some clarification. The fiscal year 2000 budget justification submitted by the administration included $300,000 for planning and design of a new facility at the Forest Products Lab in Madison, WI, to accommodate a move of the Forest Service's regional office from Milwaukee to Madison. However, on April 15, 1999, during a hearing in the Appropriations Committee on the Forest Service budget Mike Dombeck, the Chief of the Forest Service, reiterated what the Forest Service has told me in the past: The Forest Service has withdrawn the proposal to move its Milwaukee office. The idea of moving the regional office from Milwaukee first came up in response to concerns about the rent in Milwaukee. Since then General Services Administration (GSA) has indicated that by fiscal year 2000, the rent in Milwaukee will be reduced by 18 percent, eliminating the need for the move. 
   During the Appropriations Committee's markup, we inadvertently included $300,000 for the proposed move in the Forest Service's reconstruction and maintenance budget. Since the Forest Service and GSA have confirmed that the move will not and should not go forward, the Committee is directing the Forest Service to use the $300,000 in this account at the Forest Products Lab to expand the planned heat, ventilation and air conditioning work already scheduled to occur at the lab. The funding should be used to replace air conditioning equipment for buildings 33 and 34. The current equipment is more than 30 years old and is in poor condition, lacking automated controls so overtime staffing is needed to operate the equipment on weekends. Replacement of the air conditioning chillers in these buildings will be more energy efficient and will reduce overtime costs.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to engage the distinguished chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, on a matter relating to the Land Acquisition and State Assistance account for the National Park Service. 
   I was pleased to see that the Committee chose to provide funding for the Ice Age National Scenic Trail in this account. One of eight National Scenic Trails in the United States, the Ice Age Trail meanders through 31 Wisconsin counties, generally following the terminal moraine. As I noted in my request to the Subcommittee, the depth of commitment to the Ice Age Trail in the state of Wisconsin is impressive. Many volunteers, local governments,  and private organizations have contributed to the development of the trail. The state of Wisconsin has also provided essential matching funds to the trail's many partners. One of the most compelling aspects of this request for funding was the commitment from the State of Wisconsin to match the federal funding we are providing for Ice Age Trail land acquisition.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes. 
   I rise today in strong opposition to cloture on the majority leader's motion to recommit. If it carries, the Agriculture appropriations bill will be reported back to the floor with what is known as the Jeffords dairy compact amendment and will be subject to 30 hours of continuous debate. 
   Now, as most in the Senate know by now, I am committed to fighting the creation, expansion, or continuation of the price-fixing cartels known as dairy compacts. They embody bad national policy, bad economic policy, bad precedent, and disastrous implications for farmers who are forced to operate outside the protectionist walls these compacts throw up. 
   But that is not only why I oppose the Jeffords amendment. I oppose the Jeffords amendment because it would do something much worse. It would remove the Federal Government from the milk market order system. The Jeffords compact amendment would specifically disallow USDA from spending money to administer the milk market order system. What would be the result of that? According to the Secretary of Agriculture, with whom I spoke yesterday, the result would be ``chaos and confusion'' in the dairy industry. USDA would have no way to enforce any price system, so processors would end up setting the price of milk. Farmers would have no recourse to USDA or anywhere else if they thought they were receiving an unfair price.  
   What does the amendment achieve by creating this mess? Certainly not what its proponents claim. The amendment would not continue the current pricing system, or 1-A, as many of you know it. Regardless of whether this amendment passes or not, the old pricing system will expire on October 1.

   Mr. KOHL. The amendment will not create new dairy compacts in the Southeast or open up the current Northeast Compact to any new members. None of those items is contained in this amendment. 
   The amendment will not extend the life of the Northeast Dairy Compact. USDA has made it clear that the compact will expire on October 1, whether this amendment passes or not. 
   So, then, why are we even considering this amendment? I can only imagine it is because the proponents of the amendment are betting that they will get some of the things they promised--most notably, an extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact--in conference. 
   I think that is a cynical and an irresponsible bet, especially by Senators who are not even on the conference committee. Under an uncertain and unregulated system, dairy farmers across the country stand to lose $194 million a year. Furthermore, this very week dairy farmers all across America are voting on what sort of milk market system they want. So should we not wait to see what farmers have to say before we bet their farms on the Jeffords amendment? 
   The Jeffords amendment is not 1-A. It is not a dairy compact. It is a desperate last attempt to carve a dairy cartel for the Northeast out of the current pricing system. Unfortunately, the authors of the amendment used an ax rather than a knife, and the result will be a milk market order system that will be a bloody mess. 
   The proponents of this amendment have accused us of describing their amendment in a way that makes it more terrifying than the ``Blair Witch Project.'' They are correct. Their amendment is more terrifying. That is because the chaos it would create would not be a fiction; it would be real. 
   The Jeffords amendment is opposed by the 300,000 farmers of the National Farmers Union and the 300,000 taxpayers of the National Taxpayers Union. I urge my colleagues to join the taxpayers and the farmers of your States and oppose cloture on the Jeffords amendment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I had hoped that the last vote had ended the debate on dairy compacts. But if my colleagues wish to eulogize these cartels, I am happy to join them. 
   First, I want to explain why I care so much about this issue. Wisconsin is the dairy state. We have 22,000 farms, and almost all of them family-owned businesses. We have thousands more residents who make their living buying  and selling dairy products, farm equipment, barns, feed, even the early morning coffee served to the farmers who come to town straight from their milking barns each morning. Dairy compacts do not only strike at an industry in my state. They strike at the heart and soul of Wisconsin, at our way of life. 
   The Northeast dairy compact legislatively raises the price of class I milk above the prevailing federal milk marketing order price for farmers in the States lucky enough to be in the compact region. By a complicated formula, all dairy farmers in the region--regardless of what class milk they produce or for what use--receive some extra subsidy from the region's milk processors based on their overall milk production. Of course, this is a classic anti-market incentive for these farmers to produce more milk than the region needs or demands. 
   Besides having a very real cost to the Treasury, the overproduction of all sorts of milk in the compact region causes prices to fall in non-compact states for milk used to produce cheese, butter, milk powder and other products likely to be exported out of State. If the Northeast dairy compact becomes permanent, the oversupply problem will grow exponentially as Northeast farmers make the capital investments warranted by their permanent guarantee of an artificially high price for all of their milk. If compacts spread to other regions of the country, non-compact regions--the fewer and fewer farmers operating in a free market--will be squeezed even more by even more overproduction. The cost to the Treasury would be unjustifiable. The cost to efficient family farms in the Midwest would be unbearable. 
   This is more than bad economic policy. The regional favoritsm it embodies is downright un-American. What other industry sees prices set based soley on what region of the country the producer produces? What other industry faces trade barriers erected within the United States? 
   You may support dairy compacts today based on the hope your State might join a dairy compact soon or based on indifference to a dairy industry problem that doesn't have much to do with your State. But remember your support tomorrow when your neighboring state or region throws up a wall to keep you from selling fruit or vegetables or grain or beef or cars or computers in their State. That is no way to run a country. That is no policy for States that are allegedly united into one country. Mr. President, I hope we can put this issue to rest for the year and move forward with this important agricultural appropriations bill. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a few points about the increase included in this bill for enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and certain language which appears in the Senate Report to accompany the appropriations bill now before the Senate. 
   Under the Animal Welfare Act, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate standards and other requirements governing the humane handling, housing, care, treatment, and transportation of certain animals by dealers and other regulated businesses. The Secretary has delegated the authority for enforcing this Act to the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) whose budget is included in the pending appropriations bill. 
   For a number of years, the appropriated level for APHIS's enforcement activities of the Animal Welfare Act has held stagnant in the area of $9 million annually. The level of funding has allowed for employment of approximately 69 field inspectors to monitor activities in all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Obviously, this number of inspectors, responsible for such a vast geographical area, is totally insufficient to investigate and control all inappropriate and illegal mistreatment of animals where it occurs within the regulated community. For many people, their pets are essentially members of their families and too often we learn of tragedies that occur during commercial transportation where pets are injured or killed. In other instances, we learn of inhumane treatment of animals in settings often referred to as ``puppy mills'' where conditions include disease, pests, poor feeding, and other forms of mistreatment that should and must be stopped.

   Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his explanation of the activities included in the President's request for enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and for the generous increase he was able to provide in this bill. I want to stress to all Senators that the increase in this bill is designed to allow better enforcement of currently regulated activities. I am aware that the President's budget explanation also included concern that pending litigation and potentially expanded jurisdiction for enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act would further strain the limited resources of the agency. It was, in part, for that reason that language is included in Senate Report to make clear that the increase in this bill is to improve ongoing activities of the agency and not for expansion of regulated activities.

   Mr. KOHL. The Senate report language expresses our concern, as does the President's budget justification, that a strain on existing resources could potentially negate the efforts taken in our bill to increase the number of inspections at regulated facilities by inadvertently increasing the caseload of inspectors. I have heard from numerous animal care advocates in Wisconsin who have told me we need more inspectors to make sure the work now going undone is taken care of. For that reason, and not for expansion of authorities, the increase is included in this bill. 
   However, I also want to note that while the language in the Senate report expressly limits the increased funding to currently authorized activities and also expresses our concern that expansion of agency programs at this time may strain resources past the breaking point, it is not intended to chill the efforts by advocacy groups to pursue their interests through either the rulemaking process or through the courts. It is not our intention for the Senate report language to sway, in one way or the other, upcoming decisions of the courts or to infringe on the Department's proper exercise of rulemaking authority. For those who may read the report language and be concerned that we are stepping too far into the realm of agency or court activities, we may wish to consider some modifications to this language for purposes of inclusion in the statement of managers to accompany the conference report to this appropriations bill.

   Mr. KOHL. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. In my home state of Wisconsin, a number of plant pathogens cause production losses for our producers. APHIS' implementation of plant protection programs using the appropriations in this bill, consistent with the Committee's intent, will assist researchers at many universities including the University of Wisconsin in their research efforts to combat plant disease and pests.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today approved legislation that gives a Congressional ``stamp of approval'' to a settlement that the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin has long awaited. In my opinion, in the opinion of the U.S. Court of Claims that approved this settlement last year, and in the opinion of Wisconsin leaders like Governor Tommy Thompson and former Congressman Melvin Laird, this is a settlement that is long overdue. 
   As part of S. 606, the Menominee Tribal Fairness Act is the final step in a ``Legislative Reference'' that settles a 45-year-old case between the Tribe and the Federal Government once and for all. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mismanaged the Tribe's assets such as their forests and mills, leaving them ill-prepared to be self-sufficient. However, in the 1960s, Congress terminated the Tribe's federal trust status, and the Tribe plunged into years of service impoverishment and community turmoil. 
   Then in the 1970s, the Government recognized its mistake in these actions and restored the Menominee Tribe's federal trust status. Clearly, though, the decades of damage could threaten the Tribe for generations to come, so the Tribe went to court seeking compensation for the devastation it had endured. 
   After winning at trial court, this case was dismissed on technical grounds at the appellate court in 1984. The Tribe then came to Congress for help, and we passed a ``Legislative Reference'' asking the Courts to decide the merits of this case and determine what, if any, compensation was due. Before this case again headed to trial, the Department of Justice settled with the Tribe, agreeing to a sum of $32,052,547. The U.S. Court of Claims endorsed this settlement last summer. Now, as the final step in this process, Congress has approved the payment of this settlement--and from the Treasury Department's already existing ``judgment fund,'' not through a new appropriation--to finally resolve this case after 45 years. 
   This decades-old case is a perfect example of how the ``Legislative Reference'' procedure should be used: the court examines claims against the United States based on negligence or fault, or based on less than fair and honorable dealings, regardless of ``technical'' defenses that the United States may otherwise assert, especially the statute of limitations. 
   In other words, this procedure is to be used for precisely the types of circumstances surrounding the Menominee Tribe. The tribe and its members suffered grievous economic loss through legislative termination of its rights and from BIA mismanagement of its resources. Indeed, the Federal governments' actions brought the Menominee Tribe to the brink of economic, social, and cultural disaster. Although the Tribe was restored to Federal recognition and tribal status by action of the Congress, the Tribe and its members have yet to be compensated for the damages they suffered. But thanks to the Senate's actions today, that will change. 
   I thank my colleagues for supporting this vitally important ``Legislative Reference'' that will bring closure, once and for all, to a settlement that is long overdue. I especially want to thank our House sponsor, MARK GREEN, as well as Congressman SENSENBRENNER, Congressman MCCOLLUM, and Senator NICKLES, for all their hard work.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle amendment to provide relief to the farmers of this nation who now suffer from the irony of an economic crisis in rural America at a time when the rest of the nation is enjoying one of our history's greatest period of economic prosperity. Senator DASCHLE's amendment will bring much needed relief to America's farmers who face the real threat of a failed market and, in some cases, farmers who are caught in the grips of one of the worst droughts of this century. 
   Last year, Congress provided similar relief to farmers totaling nearly $6 million. The amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE is in the $10 billion range. Without question, these are huge sums of money and this Congress should not recommend their expenditure without serious consideration of the need and the consequences. However, I would like to remind my colleagues that during the farm crisis of a decade ago, farm spending for commodity price support programs in some years exceeded $25 billion. By comparison, the Daschle amendment when coupled with USDA farm outlays under current law, especially when adjusted for inflation, are modest by comparison. 
   Ask any farmer across America, including dairy farmers in Wisconsin who a few months ago witnessed the greatest drop in milk prices in history, and you will learn just how serious the current farm crisis is. The Daschle amendment is necessary to protect our farmers and their ability to protect our national food security. We can point to many different reasons why the farm economy is now suffering. But more importantly, action is needed to deal with the immediate problem. Farmers now suffer from a failed safety net and Senator DASCHLE's amendment will help patch the holes in that safety net until one of greater substance and success can be put in place.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Roth tax bill and to express disappointment that Senator MOYNIHAN's alternative did not pass the Senate. The Moynihan amendment would have provided real tax relief to those Americans who need it most, maintained the balanced budget that we fought so hard to achieve, and strengthened the Social Security and Medicare programs for generations to come. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN's amendment would have reduced the unprecedented $800 billion, ten year tax cut to a more reasonable $295 billion. The Moynihan proposal pays a fair dividend, fairly distributed, to the working families that have fueled the current economic recovery. The Roth proposal breaks the bank with tax breaks for those who don't need them, and benefit cuts to those who have already suffered them. The Moynihan proposal takes a conservative, cautious estimate of the American economic pie and divides it evenly. The Roth proposal uses ``pie in the sky'' surplus estimates to justify huge tax breaks for a very small segment of society. 
   The proponents of $800 billion worth of tax relief would have us believe that a $1 trillion surplus is as reliable and inevitable as the sun coming up in the morning. But as my colleagues know, this projection is based on the most optimistic and unrealistic assumptions--assumptions about the precise direction of the economy, which is notoriously hard to predict, and assumptions about the willingness of Congress to make large and drastic spending cuts, which is notoriously nonexistent. 
   Over the next 5 years, the smallest changes in the economy could lead the $1 trillion surplus estimate to be off by as much as $250 billion. 
   And, who among us believes that Congress and the President have the ability, or the desire, to cut programs like education, agriculture, and biomedical research by the approximately 50% required? In fact, already this year we have increased spending by $35 billion with more added every day. Furthermore, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle admit there is no way we will finish our annual appropriations bill without yet another, end-of-the-year cash infusion. 
   The surplus is not a sure thing, and basing an $800 billion tax cut on it is a long-shot gamble. It was wrong, during the years of deficit spending, to take money from future generations and spend it on ourselves. It is equally wrong today to bet the money of future generations on shaky economic projections and the surreal expectation that Congress will suddenly--for the first time--decide to make tough cuts in government spending. 
   None of this is to suggest that our budget is as bad as it was ten years ago--it is just not as good as the Roth proposal assumes. Our nation is currently enjoying record unemployment, falling welfare rolls, and increased prosperity for more Americans than at any time in history. We can and should use this opportunity to fix oversights and inequities in our tax code. Working Americans have driven this economy, and they deserve to share in it--they deserve a tax code that helps them send their children to college, that eases the burden of paying for long-term care, that encourages marriage, saving and high quality child care. Simply put, in times of economic prosperity, we have the chance--and the obligation--to expand the pool of winners in our economy. 
   And there are definitely some provisions in the Roth proposal that do just that. Both Senator ROTH's bill and the Moynihan amendment contain a version of my Child Care Tax Credit to encourage employers to get involved in increasing the supply of quality child care. Both bills also contain my Farmer Tax Fairness Act to allow farmers to realize the benefits of income averaging. And both bills provide for education tax relief, marriage penalty relief, full health insurance deduction for the self-employed, tax relief to cover the costs of long-term care, and the extension of tax credits that are vital to our economic health. 
   But despite any common elements, on almost every point, the Moynihan alternative not only does a better job of containing the overall cost of tax relief, it also focuses that relief on those taxpayers most in need of help. It is a conservative package that leaves plenty of room to preserve Social Security and Medicare, preserve the fiscal balance we have worked so hard to achieve, and pay down the national debt. 
   Mr. President, for all these reasons, I hope, when we finally get serious about writing a tax bill later this year, we will seriously consider the Moynihan alternative. It is balanced, responsible and fiscally prudent. It will help us expand opportunities and make life better and easier for more Americans and their families. And we should reject the Roth proposal. It turns the clock back to the failed budget policies of the past, while providing too much benefit for too few Americans at too great a cost.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Patient Abuse Prevention Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator REID, who has worked tirelessly with me on this important legislation. 
   This bill is the product of collaboration and input from the administration, the health care industry, patient and employee advocates--who all have the same goal I do: protecting patients in long-term care from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment. 
   Last fall, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a report describing how easy it is for people with abusive and criminal backgrounds to find work in nursing homes. On September 14 of last year, the Senate Aging Committee held hearings on this disturbing problem, where we heard horrifying stories of elderly patients being abused by the very people who are charged with their care. While the vast majority of nursing home workers are dedicated and professional, even one instance of abuse is inexcusable. This should not be happening in a single nursing home in America. 
   Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43 percent of Americans over the age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number of people needing long-term care services will continue to increase as the Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of nursing homes, home health agencies and hospices do an excellent job in caring for their patients. But it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing environment. 
   A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, and have subsequently abused patients in their care. In 1997, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this problem, which led my home State of Wisconsin to pass a criminal background check law for health care workers. The legislation I introduce today follows their example and builds on their efforts. 
   Why is it necessary to act? Because it is just far too easy for a worker with a history of abuse to find employment and prey on the most vulnerable patients. The OIG report found that 5 percent of nursing home employees in two States had prior criminal records. The OIG also found that between 15-20 percent of those convicted of patient abuse had prior criminal records. It is just too easy for known abusers to find work in health care and continue to prey on patients. 
   Current state and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of abusive nurse aides. But nurse aids are not the only workers involved in abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there is no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides between States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving to Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there. 
   In addition, there is no Federal requirement that long-term care facilities conduct criminal background checks on prospective employees. People with violent criminal backgrounds--people who have already been convicted of murder, rape, and assault--could easily get a job in a nursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being discovered. 
   Our legislative will go a long way toward solving this problem. First, it will create a National Registry of abusive long-term care employees. States will be required to submit information from their current State registries to the National Registry. Facilities will be required to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective worker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of patient abuse will be prohibited from working in long-term care. 
   Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to protect patients from violent criminals. If the National Registry does not contain information about a prospective worker, the facility is then required to initiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for patient abuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from working with patients. 
   I realize that this legislation will not solve all instances of abuse. We still need to do more to stop abuse from occurring in the first place. But this bill will ensure that those who have already abused an elderly or disabled patient, and those who have committed violent crimes against people in the past, are kept away from vulnerable patients. 
   Mr. President, I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most long-term care providers and their staff work hard to deliver the highest quality care. However, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get rid of those that don't. When a patient checks into a nursing home or hospice, or receives home health care, they should not have to give up their right to be free from abuse, neglect, or mistreatment. 
   Our nation's seniors made our country what it is today. It is our obligation to make sure we treat them with the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues, the administration, and the health care industry in this effort to protect patients. Our nation's seniors and disabled deserve nothing less than our full attention.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his questions, his acknowledgment of the severity of the Meth problem faced by rural communities and cities in the Midwest and throughout our country, and his active support for increased funding to combat Meth. In my own State of Wisconsin, criminal justice officials recognized early on that we had to develop a strategy and consolidate our enforcement and prevention efforts to limit the spread of the Meth epidemic that has been invading our Western Wisconsin borders from Minnesota and Iowa since the mid 1990's. Today, the number of Meth-related incidents is increasing. The Wisconsin State Laboratory reported increases of Meth analysis from 42 examinations in 1996 to 112 examinations in 1998. In 1998 alone, the Wisconsin Department of Narcotics Enforcement opened 90 investigations regarding Meth and prosecuted 40 individuals. In Wisconsin, Meth users generally range from 18 to 25, and recently there was even a disturbing report of Meth trafficking in a rural high school. 
   With the escalation of Meth trafficking, in February 1997 Wisconsin law enforcement officials organized a coordinated enforcement and prevention initiative among local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to target Meth traffickers. This major effort also addressed the need for training to prevent the potential health threat from toxic and flammable chemicals in clandestine Meth labs. Funding for this continuing intiative has been raised from a variety of sources, including the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance and the State Attorney General. 
   Recently, representatives from Wisconsin agricultural associations have reached out to their members and communities to educate the public about the dangers of Anhydrous ammonia, a precursor used in the crude production of Meth. These associations are now working with law enforcement as well. 
   And this May, the State Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin sponsored three Meth symposiums to educate and train members of the criminal justice system. 
   The $1 million appropriated for the Western Wisconsin Methamphetamine Initiative will help build on these efforts and promote more coordination of anti-Meth activities. It will be used jointly by the Office of Attorney General (through the Division of Narcotics Enforcement) and the Office of Justice Assistance (under the direction of the Governor) to support a plan developed in coordination with each other to continue combatting Meth production, distribution and use and for policing initiatives in ``hot spots'' of Meth trafficking activity. Part of this funding will also be used for community and school-based Meth education and prevention awareness programs. 
   Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina--and our Chairman, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator GREGG--for their commitment to addressing the Meth problem.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. 6, the Patients Bill of Rights. After 2 years of partisan struggles, I am pleased that we finally have the opportunity to consider this important bill, which could benefit all 161 million Americans in managed health care plans. 
   For many years, managed care has helped to rein in the rapidly growing costs of health care. That benefits all patients across the nation and helps to keep health care costs in check. 
   However, there is a real difference between making quality health care affordable and cutting corners on patient care. In Wisconsin, we are lucky that most health plans do a good job in keeping costs low and providing quality care. But too often across this nation, HMOs put too many obstacles between doctors and patients. In the name of saving a few bucks, too many patients must hurdle bureaucratic obstacles to get basic care. Even worse, too many patients are being denied essential treatment based on the bottom line rather than on what is best for them. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure that patients come first--not HMO profits or health plan bureaucrats. It makes sure that doctors, in consultation with patients, are the ones who decide which treatments are medically necessary. It gives patients access to information about all available treatments and not just the cheapest. Whether to seek emergency care, pursue treatment by a specialist, or try an innovative new treatment--these are hard questions that should be answered by caring physicians and concerned families--not by a calculator. S. 6 puts these decisions back in human hands where they belong. 
   This legislation will also make sure that health plans are held accountable for the decisions they make. First, all health plans must have an external appeals process in place, so that patients who challenge HMO decisions may take their case to an independent panel of medical experts. And second, if a health plan's decision to deny or delay care results in death or injury to the patient, this bill ensures that the health plan can be held accountable for its actions. 
   Most importantly, this bill gives all of these protections to all Americans in managed health care plans, not just a few. All 161 million Americans in managed health plans deserve the same protections--no matter what State they live in. 
   I am shocked by the refusal of some of my colleagues to endorse this commonsense legislation. If you or a member of your family got sick, who would you trust to make decisions about their care? Who would you trust to decide what kind of specialist was necessary? Who would you trust to tell you about all available treatments and not just the cheapest? Wouldn't you insist on having access to the best possible medical care? Most of us would. Why should the 161 million Americans in managed health care deserve less than what we would insist upon? 
   The answer is, simply, that all Americans deserve access to the best quality health care available. As someone who comes from a business background, I understand the concerns of employers. Some of my colleagues on the other side have claimed that our bill will increase health care costs by as much as $72 billion, making it impossible for employers and families to afford coverage. But the Congressional Budget Office reported that the patient protections in our bill will only increase premiums by 4.8 percent over 5 years. This translates into only $2 per month for the average employee. An independent Coopers & Lybrand study found that our provision to hold health plans accountable--the provision the other side opposes the most--would only cost 3 to 13 cents per person per month. This is a small price to pay to make sure that health plans cover the health care services we all deserve. 
   I am willing to look at possible improvements to the bill. But there is no reason whatsoever to continue to allow health plans to skimp on quality in the name of saving profits. Patients have been in the waiting room long enough. It is time for the Senate to act and make sure they receive the health care they need, deserve, and pay for.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumers Dairy Relief Act, a bill that will save American consumers $500 million a year on their milk, cheese and dairy purchases. This legislation terminates the Federal Milk Marketing Orders by the year 2001. 
   Consumers are paying far more than necessary for their dairy purchases because our current system encourages milk production in high cost areas. Our nation's milk pricing laws, which were designed in the 1930's, are seriously outdated and long overdue to be reformed. Dairy farmers in Wisconsin have suffered under the present system for too long. Wisconsin loses, 1,500 dairy farmers a year, not because they are inefficient, but because a federal law discriminates against them by preventing them from competing on a level playing field. 
   Opponents of this legislation will tell you that we need to keep the present system in order to maintain a fresh milk supply in their states. While that may have been true in the 1930's, when we lacked the refrigeration technology necessary to store and transport milk, it is certainly not true today. We can now easily and safely transport perishable milk and cheese products between regions of the United States. In fact, the industry has actually perfected the system to such a degree that we now export cheese to countries around the world. 
   Mr. President, as the United States expands its role in the export dairy market and enters into more trade agreements, our domestic agricultural policy is coming under intense scrutiny. Another reason to eliminate our antiquated milk pricing system is that it will give us another negotiating tool to use during the next round of WTO discussions scheduled to take place in Seattle this fall. 
   Our trading partners are growing increasingly concerned about the intervention of the federal government in the pricing of milk. Earlier this month, The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries said  they want to put the issue of USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Orders and dairy compacts on the table for discussion at the next round of Agricultural discussions in Seattle this fall. 
   By passing this legislation and reforming our milk pricing laws, we can eliminate another hurdle currently in the way of negotiating agricultural trade agreements that would open up new markets for our farmers. 
   Mr. President, if the Senate decides to discuss reforming our milk pricing system, we must give serious consideration to eliminating the present system. Today I have touched on a few of the reasons we need to scrap our current milk pricing system. There are many others, but I will save those for another time.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to you today to pay tribute to one of Wisconsin's finest educators, Forrest ``Woody'' Weber. Woody recently retired after a distinguished career spanning 36 years. Focusing his talents in elementary schools, Woody proved instrumental in developing the young lives of his students. 
   Woody served children and their families as a guidance counselor for 21 consistent years, during which time he specialized in classroom and small group counseling. One of his most substantial accomplishments during this time was addressing the needs of students with cerebral palsy. Since many of these students use ``bliss boards'' to communicate, Woody developed a unit to be used by other students so they could understand this communication device. This act of kindness earned Woody many public accolades, leading up to his 1993 nomination for ``Educator of the Year.'' 
   Woody's service and volunteerism permeated every aspect of his long career. Between organizing an annual slide show for graduating sixth-graders, serving on both the Menasha school board as well as the City Council, sitting on numerous other community boards, coaching local athletics, and volunteering for the Salvation Army, he served his community well. Woody's wife, Dale, worries that his new retirement will keep him away from home even more because it will allow him more time to volunteer. 
   Though his daily presence as an educator will be missed, we wish Woody all the best in his retirement.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am very glad to join my friend from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN, in bringing to the floor S. 1233, the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies. I am grateful to Senator COCHRAN, the Chairman of the subcommittee, for his gracious approach to crafting this bill and for the fair and reasonable manner in which the interests of all Senators have been given consideration. 
   Senator COCHRAN has outlined the general spending levels for items included in this bill. I would like to emphasize to all Senators the importance of the programs funded by this bill, and the need to ensure its passage. This bill provides funding for programs vital for our nation's continued leadership in agricultural production through research, implementation of farming practices, and marketing. This bill also includes funding to protect the environment, to restore economic prosperity to rural America, and to improve the standard of living there. This bill provides funds to help feed the most vulnerable of our populations at home and abroad, and this bill helps American farmers maintain a strong presence in foreign markets while, at the same time, combating the destructive consequences of unfair foreign trade. Also, this bill provides funds important to protect the public health of this nation in the areas of food safety, medical drugs and devices, and oversight of our blood supply. 
   There will likely be some Senators who will question whether the levels of spending in this bill are adequate. When our subcommittee received its initial allocation for discretionary spending, I had grave concerns that we would not be able to craft a bill that I could support. I was prepared to vote against the allocations at that time, but Chairman STEVENS persuaded me that we needed to move forward in order for the full Senate to see what effect the discretionary caps will have on ongoing programs in fiscal year 2000. Fortunately, since then our subcommittee did receive an increase in the allocation, and I supported reporting this bill at both the subcommittee and full committee levels. 
   I have received a communication from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget regarding this bill. While that letter describes certain programs for which the Administration would like to see increased funding, there is nothing in the letter to indicate that the President would not approve this bill if sent to the White House in its present form. Likewise, I have letters from Secretary Glickman that makes appeals for increased funding in some areas, and at the appropriate time, I will ask unanimous consent that these letters be entered into the RECORD. 
   The Senate Report to accompany this bill begins with the following statement, ``Given the budgetary constraints that the Committee faces, the bill as reported provides the proper amount of emphasis on agricultural and rural development programs, and on other programs and activities funded by the bill.'' I believe this statement to be true. Senator COCHRAN has done an outstanding job in crafting a bill that is fair, and goes far in meeting the expectations of all Senators, and in view of the foregoing statement, I join Senator COCHRAN in supporting this bill. 
   Still, we should all give pause to consider the first four words of the statement I quoted above, ``Given the budgetary constraints'' and the implication of those words for the work that this Congress must complete before September 30th. In terms of the bill before us today, each Senator will have to consider for his or her self whether the ``budgetary constraints'' have weakened the programs in this bill beyond the point they can allow. Over the past several years, we have seen programs at USDA, FDA, and the other agencies funded by this bill, suffer a slow strangulation that is affecting programs and services to the American people and the ability of the agencies to carry them out. 
   I do support my chairman, Senator COCHRAN, in urging the passage of this bill, but I seriously hope that we have all come to the realization that continued reductions in these programs must come to a halt. It is for the full Senate to decide whether we have already gone too far. 
   Mr. President, during committee debate on this bill, an amendment was discussed, though never offered, that involved dairy pricing issues. That amendment would have extended the life of the Northeast dairy compact and created new compacts in other regions. In committee, I was willing to delay the agriculture spending bill indefinitely to avoid inclusion of such an amendment. It concerns complex issues in the jurisdiction of the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees--issues that have no place on a funding bill. Also, if passed, the amendment would do unacceptable damage to the dairy industry in the State of Wisconsin and all around the Upper Midwest. And finally, it would put in place permanently and nationally an unprecedented policy of regional protectionism. 
   For these reasons, I, and many of my colleagues, oppose such an amendment adamantly and will do everything within our rights to keep it off of this bill. To that end, I regret to inform my colleagues, I will not be able to clear any amendments, no matter how uncontroversial, or agree to any manager's package, until it is clear no destructive dairy amendment will be offered or included in this bill.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the communications from the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Agriculture make the case for the need to provide additional resources for this bill. I am also aware that funding constraints have prevented the bill from including levels of spending for programs important to Senators. In support of, and in addition to, the comments provided by OMB and USDA, I would like to offer the following observations. 
   While this bill provides a substantial increase for the President's Food Safety Initiative, it does not meet the fully recommended level submitted by the President. Perhaps the greatest single responsibility of this subcommittee is to protect public health. That responsibility is carried out primarily through  oversight of the blood supply, the approval of medical drugs and devices and, most certainly, the food supply. 
   Many of the procedures for protecting our food supply are now in transition, moving toward a HACCP system that provides a new set of checks and balances in the production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution of food. In addition, we are learning through research new techniques to help enhance the safety of the food we eat. It is unfortunate we are unable to find the resources within our ``budgetary constraints'' to provide the fully requested increase. We should, at least, provide the fully recommended level for inspections of meat and poultry provided for the Food Safety Inspection Service. 
   One of the most popular programs funded in this bill is the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Again, this bill provides a significant increase for this program and I am very happy to report that the level appropriated, more than $4.038 billion, is determined to be adequate to support an average program participation level of 4.7 million people, which is likely to be an increase above the FY 1999 participation average. However, we know that this program is not only popular, it works. It works in protecting people who are nutritionally at risk, and it works to protect the American taxpayer by lowering future health care costs. The President's budget would have allowed for the program to grow to the fully targeted participation level of 7.5 million women, infants, and children and this Congress should be providing the resources to make that happen. 
   In addition, this bill should be providing higher levels for WIC Farmers Market Program, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Nutrition, Education and Training Program, for the Commodity Assistance and Food Donation Programs and for the Secretary's 
   Food Recovery and Gleaning initiative. Also, this bill should restore full levels for the studies and evaluations activities of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). It is curious that while Food Stamp rolls are dropping, we are seeing increased demand for food assistance at shelters, through charitable organizations, and through the various food donation programs. We need to understand this phenomena better and to do so, the agency in charge of these programs should be given the tools to research and evaluate what is happening. At the very least, a reasonable level of funds should be provided to FNS to conduction studies and evaluations of activities directly related to nutrition. 
   Agriculture has always been, and continues to be, the backbone of the American economy and society. The history of this nation is firmly grounded in the development of agriculture beginning with the earliest settlers who learned farming techniques, such as fertilization, from Native Americans. The first Thanksgiving was, among other things, a celebration of agriculture. 
   As the growth of America continued, agriculture was a driving force economically, socially, and politically. Thomas Jefferson, whose philosophy in so many ways personifies the national spirit, centered much of his political and governmental engineering around the role of the farmer. In time, farming in this nation followed the lines of westward expansion and filled the vast spaces of our interior with continuing advances in production and further development of democratic principles. When the United States entered the stage of world power, especially during our two world wars and since, the American farmer continued to provide the basic necessities to keep our armed forces fed and our populations safe. 
   In so many ways, food security is an integral part of national security. We all are aware of the hard times now facing farmers and the rural economy. Yet, without agriculture, and the economy that supports it, food shortages and disruptions would lead to urban panic and riots. No region of the nation would be safe and our entire national security would be at risk. In spite of these facts, we struggle to find the resources to protect agriculture. Can any Senator imagine how absurd it would sound to stand here on the floor of the Senate and announce that we simply can't afford national security? To a degree, that is what we are saying when we announce that we can't afford to help our farmers. 
   Does this bill fully fund the request for agricultural research, no it does not. Neither does it provide funding for initiatives to help farmers overcome today's economic troubles through outreach to socially disadvantaged farmers, small farmers, or to help USDA agencies protect against unwarranted market concentration. This bill does not provide additional levels to help establish and hold on to foreign markets through export programs such as PL 480 which combines humanitarian assistance with overseas market development. 
   I am also disappointed that our allocation has prevented us from making the gains we should in the area of conservation and environmental protection. In order to achieve savings, this bill has had to impose limitations on the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Conservation Farm Option program. It also fails to fully fund many of the other conservation initiatives recommended by the President. 
   In addition, if resources were available, we could provide additional funds to help the environment, and the farmer, through the development of better methods for overcoming pesticide related problems. In the near future, the fumigant methyl bromide is going to be removed from the market and unless a viable alternative is developed, production of various commodities will fall sharply, much to the dismay of farmers and consumers who have come to take the availability of these food items for granted. Also, this bill does not provide adequate levels for Integrated Pest Management and for program increases requested for implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act. 
   Mr. President, there are many other items I could describe and I do not, in any way, want to detract from the fine work of my colleague, Senator COCHRAN. As I stated earlier, my friend from Mississippi has done an outstanding job in crafting this bill with the resources he was given, and I support him and this bill. I simply feel it is my responsibility to remind my colleagues that everything is not necessarily fine simply because things are not getting a whole lot worse. 
   I don't know if this subcommittee will receive any additional resources between now and when this bill goes to conference with the House. We can't count on that happening and we must realize that what we approve here may be all that is finally included in the appropriations for these programs in fiscal year 2000. As we proceed with this bill on the floor, it is important that we all work together for what is best for all farmers and for all areas of rural America, and for all Americans.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we should act both to deter frivolous litigation over Y2K defects and to encourage Y2K fixes, but this bill will create as many problems as it solves. Instead of merely establishing incentives to address Y2K defects, several provisions in this bill could, perversely, discourage companies from acting responsibly and reward those who silently --and inexcusably--wait for defects to happen rather than cure them before disaster strikes. In short, I will oppose this measure because it fails to strike the right balance. 
   To be sure, the bill has improved from earlier versions, and some sections--like class action reform to curtail frivolous lawsuits and a 90-day waiting period to promote remediation instead of litigation--are steps in the right direction. Still, provisions like limits on punitive damages and a one-sided duty on consumers to anticipate all Y2K defects give businesses an excuse to continue doing nothing because even the bad actors end up with a lower risk for liability. And provisions like the elimination of ``joint and several'' liability, which I have supported in other contexts, seem out of place here where remediation is the heart of the matter. In other words, if a company isn't fixing a defect when it could be 100 percent liable, why should limiting its liability to a fraction of that be anything but a disincentive to take corrective steps? 
   While this issue has become a political football here in Washington, it doesn't play the same way in Wisconsin, where we know how to play football. Our home State businesses are concerned about the potential for wasteful litigation, and they want to see fixes rather than breakdowns. Like me, they do want Y2K liability reform. That is why I supported the Kerry/Robb substitute. But the Wisconsin businesses who've contacted me don't have very strong feelings about any of the provisions unique to the McCain/Wyden bill. And it is not surprising because, unlike as with product liability reform, here they are more likely to be plaintiffs than defendants, making them weary of measures that discourage remedial action. 
   I continue to believe that we should generally reform litigation. But if we are going to start doing it piecemeal, the place to start is probably in the  product liability context, where 90-year-old products, still in use, are being judged by today's standards. The place not to start with sweeping reform is here--especially when it would benefit a software manufacturer who produces a product in 1998 that becomes dysfunctional just two years later and did nothing at all to try to prevent the defect from happening. 
   That said, there are moderate steps we have taken, and can take, to help address the Y2K issue. For example, last year I cosponsored and Congress passed the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act. This law encourages the disclosure and exchange of information about computer processing problems by raising the standard regarding when companies can be liable for releasing false information. I also cosponsored the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, which was signed into law earlier this year. It expands the Small Business Administration's lending program to provide companies with assistance as they work to become Y2K compliant. The Kerry/Robb substitute is a reasonable measure that can make a difference and, indeed, that the President can sign. 
   When all is said and done, I suspect we will enact a law this year and before the Year 2000, and that it will look a lot more like the Kerry/Robb substitute than the unbalanced bill before the Senate today. That would be fair to the high tech world and it would be in the best interests of consumers and small businesses in Wisconsin.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am aware that an amendment or amendments relating to dairy policy may be offered during full committee mark-up on the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development and Related agencies. I serve as ranking member for the Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee and I am proud of the work I have done with Senator COCHRAN, Chairman of the Subcommittee, in preparing the bill for fiscal year 2000 and having it approved unanimously by the entire Subcommittee. I am, therefore, very distressed to learn of possible amendments that are authorizing in nature, and that would result in setting dairy policy with disastrous consequences for my State and region. 
   Due to my very strong commitment to keep the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill clean of amendments of the nature suggested, I am prepared to take whatever steps possible to prevent inclusion of these amendments during consideration of the bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee. I strongly believe that the issues surrounding these amendments are of such an important nature that deliberation by the full Senate is imperative. If proponents of these amendments wish to bring them to the floor to offer and debate them, I welcome the opportunity for the discussion. However, I will do all I can to ensure that these matters are not decided by the smaller number of Senators that comprise the Appropriations Committee. 
   In the event an amendment or amendments relating to dairy policy, such as one establishing or extending interstate compacts, are offered for adoption by the full Appropriations Committee, I am prepared to offer, and will offer, a number of second degree amendments to eliminate the harmful policy that amendment proponents apparently seek to impose on farmers and consumers. Also, in an attempt to keep this sort of anti-consumer, anti-farmer amendment from ending up on the bill, I am prepared to offer, either as first or second degree amendments, a number of other amendments--some related to the bill and some not. If the committee chooses to enter into controversial debates that belong in authorizing committees, I too have several non-Appropriations issues that I would like considered. 
   I do not relish holding up the work of my Committee, and I will not if these sort of dairy amendments are not offered. But I feel it is only fair to my fellow Committee members and to the Senate to let them know how very seriously I take attempts to harm the dairy industry in the State of Wisconsin. 
   The amendments I may offer that are relevant to the Agriculture Appropriations bill, include, but are not limited to: 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the President's Food Safety Initiative. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the WIC program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the President's Human Nutrition Initiative. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the Wetlands Reserve Program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the Conservation Farm Option Program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the TEFAP program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds relating to the Food Quality Protection Act. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the National Research Initiative. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the NET program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the Food and Drug Administration. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the EQIP program. 
   An amendment to provide additional funds for the Fund for Rural America. 
   An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on the history of dairy policy. 
   An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on diary compacts and their harmful effects on consumers. 
   An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on dairy compacts and their fundamental conflict with the principles of free trade. 
   An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on dairy compacts and their harmful effect on the Midwestern dairy industry. 
   An amendment to express a sense of the Senate on the economic policy problems with dairy compacts. 
   In addition to these, I have at least 40 other amendments funding changes to the bill that will require votes by the full Committee. 
   I also have many amendments not relevant to the bill and more in the nature of authorizing legislation. However, as I said before, if the Committee is going to consider dairy legislation of an authorizing nature--legislation with a very real impact on my State--I would insist on also considering other authorizing issues of importance to my constituents. These would include: 
   The Patient Abuse Prevention Act: This amendment is based on my bill that establishes a national registry of abusive long-term care workers, and requires nursing homes, home health agencies and hospices to check the registry and do criminal background checks on potential employees before hiring them. 
   Folic Acid Promotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act: This amendment is based on a bill I will be introducing with BOND and ABRAHAM next week. It would authorize $20 million per year to provide education and training to health care providers and the public on the need for women to take folic acid to reduce birth defects. 
   Sense of the Senate on the nursing home bill: This amendment is based on an amendment that passed two years ago on the Budget Resolution. It is a Sense of the Senate that Congress should create a national registry system so long-term care facilities may conduct background checks on potential employees. 
   Organ distribution amendment: This amendment would nullify the HHS proposed rule that changes 
   the way organs are distributed across the nation. 
   Class size fix: This would amend the Class Size Reduction program to ensure that smaller school districts have access to their class size funds without having to form a consortium with other districts. 
   National Family Caregiver Support program: This would provide support services, including respite services, to persons caring for a disabled or elderly relative. 
   Sodas in Schools: This is based on a bill introduced by LEAHY, JEFFORDS, KOHL, and FEINGOLD last month) This would prohibit the giveaways of free sodas during the school lunch program. 
   The Child Care Infrastructure Act: This amendment would establish a tax credit for employers who provided child care benefit to their employees. 
   Child Support Pass Through: This amendment would reform the child support collection system to provide more income support for low-income families. 
   Income Averaging for Farmers: This, and another amendment creating Farmer IRAs would establish more fairness for farmers. 
   Several foreign policy Sense of the Senates including: A sense of the Senate resolution calling for a United States effort to end restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus; a sense of the Senate resolution condemning Palestinian efforts to revive the original Palestine partition plan of November 29, 1947, and condemning the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for its April 27, 1999, resolution endorsing Palestinian self-determination on the basis of the original Palestine partition plan; a sense of the Senate regarding a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor, and for other purposes. 
   Apostle Islands: An amendment to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study whether the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore should be protected as a wilderness area. 
   Zachary Baumel: An amendment to locate and secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a citizen of the United States, and other Israeli soldiers missing in action. 
   Women's Business center: A bill to amend the Small Business Act with respect to the women's business center program. 
   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness.  
   Military Reservists: An amendment to authorize the Small Business Administration to provide financial and business development assistance to military reservists' small business, and for other purposes. 
   Menominee: An amendment to provide for the settlement of claims of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farmer Tax Fairness Act, along with my farm state colleagues, Senators BURNS and HAGEL. This legislation is a targeted provision that will help ensure that farmers have access to tax benefits rightfully owed to them. 
   As you know, farmers' income often fluctuates from year to year based on unforeseen weather or market conditions. Income averaging allows farmers to ride out these unpredictable circumstances by spreading out their income over a period of years. Last year, we acted in a bipartisan manner to make income averaging a permanent provision of the tax code. Unfortunately, since that time, we have learned that, due to interaction with another tax code provision, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), many of  our nation's farmers have been unfairly denied the benefits of this important accounting tool. 
   As you know, the AMT was originally designed to ensure that all taxpayers, particularly those eligible for certain tax preferences, paid a minimum level of taxes. Due to inflation and the enactment of other tax provisions, more and more Americans are now subject to the AMT. While other reforms are required to keep the AMT focused on its original mission, our legislation addresses the specific concern of farmers relying on income averaging. Under our legislation, if a farmer's AMT liability is greater than taxes due under the income averaging calculation, that farmer would disregard the AMT and pay taxes according to the averaging calculation. In this way, farmers would still pay tax, but would also have access to tools designed to alleviate the inevitable ups and downs of the agricultural economy. 
   This provision is a modest and reasonable measure designed to ensure farmers are treated fairly when it comes time to file their taxes. I urge my colleague to lend their support. Thank you.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to request a boycott by all Senators to the ``Alternative Ice Cream Party'' being sponsored by Senators from the Northeastern United States. The ``Party'' is designed to rally support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The dairy compact that was eliminated by the recently revised milk marketing orders has cost consumers in the Northeast over $60 million and cost child and nutrition programs an additional $9 million. If proposals to expand dairy compacts to 27 states this year are adopted, it will force 60% of the consumers in the nation to pay an additional $2 billion, that's correct, $2 billion a year in higher milk prices. And while the Northeast's consumers are purchasing overpriced milk, Wisconsin is losing dairy farmers by the day--over 7,000 in the past few years. 
   Mr. President, rather than ice cream, the Northeast Senators should give away cow manure instead: At least  then the freebies would have some relation to the legislation they are pushing. There are many other areas of concern I have in regard to this issue, particularly why the hard-working cows in the Northeast are not seeing the money from the extra profits that the large processors are making. I am surprised that animal rights and labor activists have not raised issue with the long hours worked and extra milk that cows in the Northeast are forced to produce. I am doubly surprised that my good friends from the Northeast can sit in Washington eating free ice cream while poor children in New England end up paying more for their school lunch milk because of the dairy compact. 
   If we as the United States can no longer expect to give a fair (milk) shake to dairy farmers and consumers across the country, then maybe it is time for the Northeast to secede from the Union. Maybe Canada would be willing to accept them. But then, of course, the North American Free Trade Agreement would require them to practice free trade and eliminate the dairy compact.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recommend an article that appeared this week on National Journal's website. It is ``More New Budget Math'' by Stan Collender and discusses in a very readable way why gross federal debt continues to rise even when the government is running a surplus. The concepts of deficit, surplus, debt, and trust funds lie at the heart of many of our fiercest budget battles, and everyone has an opinion, or a one-liner, about all of them. But these concepts are as technical and difficult to understand as they are controversial, and I always appreciate it when they are explained in a clear manner, as they are in this article.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of recent engineering breakthroughs in the area of naval propulsion. In the past few years, industry has been working hard to develop electric drive technology that could be used in a naval vessel. Electric drive would replace the traditional mechanical drive system, that turns the ship's propellers through a system of reduction gears, with a system that uses electricity directly to turn the engines and power the rest of the ship's systems. 
   Electric drive offers major benefits over mechanical drive. It is more efficient in terms of reduced fuel consumption and requires fewer crew to maintain. It can also generate more power than mechanical systems. Electric drive is also quieter, making it an attractive option for submarines, or any vessel concerned with stealth. Industry analysts believe electric drive could save the Navy $4.3 billion over the life of the new destroyer program, the DD-21, alone.  
   Last year the appropriations committee included a provision in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill asking the Navy to produce a report on the potential for electric drive. The Secretary of the Navy released the study in March, a study that was a powerful endorsement of the electric drive technology. This report points to electric drive as a technology that will no doubt have major implications for the future of naval ship design and engineering. I hope the Navy will continue its research efforts, and make every effort to include this technology in the next generation of destroyers, the DD-21. I also hope the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee will maintain its interest in the program and continue its support.

   Mr. KOHL. As I am sure the chairman and ranking member are aware, much of the research into this technology has been privately funded. General Dynamics and Eaton Corporation, among others, have been leaders in the field of electric drive and their efforts have been crucial to moving the development along. Their investment has presented the Navy and Congress with an excellent opportunity to take advantage of developments financed in the private sector. As the Navy continues to evaluate electric drive and the DD-21 program I hope the committee will be ready to capitalize on that investment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to draw the Senate's attention to the CBO cost estimate on the Defense Authorization bill. In the Budget Resolution Congress agreed that the national defense account would have $288 billion in Budget authority and $276 in outlays for fiscal year 2000. 
   The CBO estimates that the Defense Authorization bill as it currently stands in the Senate, would exceed the outlay level by almost $7 billion. The Budget Committees of the House and Senate have told CBO to reduce their score of the outlays by $10 billion in order that the bill fit under the caps. While this changes the scoring number, it does not change the fact that the bill still authorizes the Department of Defense to spend $284 billion next year, $7 billion over the caps. 
   Whether someone agrees with the Budget Resolution or not, these sorts of end runs are destructive to the process by undermining popular confidence in the institution. 
   If there is not enough money for Defense in the Budget Resolution, then members should not have supported it back in March. If there was enough in March, nothing has changed, and it should be enough now. The Congress recently passed a Supplemental Appropriations bill that include $11 billion for funding for the Kosovo operation, almost $5 billion over the President's request, so there should be plenty of money for our operation in Europe. Now, if members grudgingly supported the Resolution because of the assurances of the Budget Committee Chairman that he would ``fix the outlay problem'' I ask them to show me the fix. It looks as thought the Budget Committee did nothing but allow Defense spending to exceed the budget caps without letting any other program do the same. 
   Congress should own up to the fact that the Budget caps are being exceeded. They are being quietly raised by hiding the increase in a scoring gimmick. Members should take notice that the way to get more money for your appropriations priorities is to petition the Budget Committee for an ``outlay fix''. 
   There is going to be a train wreck at the end of this year, and we all know it. There is going to be a train wreck, and it will happen because no one is driving the train, we are all just nervously looking out the window admiring the scenery and trying not to think of our impending doom. 
   I have faith that the American people will eventually figure out how much we are going to spend next year. The increases in Defense spending will no doubt be joined by a tremendous amount of last minute spending at the end of the year. The American people will look at what Congress told them we would spend at the beginning of the year, and what we will eventually agree to at the close of the year and they will be very surprised at the difference. I hope they hold us accountable. 
   It is worth noting that we do not have to be in this situation. Congress could take action to cut unnecessary spending in the defense account. This would reduce the pressure on the discretionary budget, and free up resources for other needs around the country. 
   Another two rounds of base closures for example, while increasing outlays in the short run, would yield savings of $4 billion over ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office. I co-sponsored Senator MCCAIN's legislation on this matter, and I co-sponsored the McCain-Levin amendment, which would only authorize one additional round. I was disappointed the Senate refused to support this worthy alternative. The military has come to the Senate time and again pleading with us to give them the authority to close bases through the Commission process in a manner isolated from political pressures. Had we supported base closure rounds when they were initially requested we might not now be pushing so tightly against the budget caps, while straining under draconian cuts in the non-defense accounts. 
   Senator KERREY has also offered an amendment that could help reduce the need to rely on budget gimmickry without reducing our capacity overseas. He would simply allow the Department of Defense to reduce our nuclear forces below the START I levels  of 6,500 warheads. According to CBO, if we reduce our warheads to the START II level of 3,500 the Department of Defense could save $12.7 billion by 2009. All that savings would come without reducing our conventional capability one iota. While nuclear deterrence is still important, it can be accomplished with many fewer missiles, and at less cost. 
   My point, Mr. President, is defense spending does not have to be this high. It is only this high because Congress and the Department of Defense are unwilling to make the tough choices to bring the cost of defending our nation and international interests down to a sustainable level. When our troops are deployed overseas, and in harms way, it is hard to critically look at the defense budget for unnecessary or unwise spending. Our instinct is to give our brave men and women whatever they need and then some to get the job done. I would argue, however, that it is even more important now than ever to closely examine our spending priorities. We need to stretch every defense dollar as far as it can go, and to do that we need to look for efficiencies and cut wasteful projects and items that contribute little to our defense. 
   Careful spending is the way to reduce outlays, not budget gimmicks. Congress needs to be more critical, not more clever.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the conference report before us. It uses funds for undeniably urgent needs--our operations in Kosovo, our rescue of struggling family farmers, our efforts to dig out from the hurricanes of last year and the tornados of this month--to mask spending on unnecessary and unbudgeted urges. That is more than dishonest; it is disgraceful. It is like agreeing to let your neighbors use your car to take their sick child to the hospital--if they also agree to pick up and pay for your groceries, your dry cleaning, a set of new tires for the car, and a pizza. 
   It is no surprise that people are cynical about talk that comes out of Washington. By adopting this conference report, we prove our work means very little. We prove that the budget we endorsed just two months ago was not a promise--it was posturing. We prove that we are more interested in sound bites than sound accounting. 
   Mr. President, I understand that there are genuine emergencies that require us to spend beyond what we had anticipated for a given fiscal year. I will vote to fund such emergencies immediately and work out the budget details later. I also understand that there are supplemental spending requirements that can come up during the year. And I will also support passing supplemental appropriations bills and paying for them within the budget limits we have set for ourselves. What I find unconscionable is what we are doing here today: attempting to get around the draconian budget resolution we passed in March by stuffing as much supplemental spending as possible in this bill and then treating it as an emergency. 
   Given my strong feelings on this, I would like to clarify my vote to waive the Gramm point of order. Senator GRAMM, rightly I believe, raised many of the same issues that concern me. His point of order, however, did a surgeon's job with a hatchet. His point of order would have brought down spending that was truly emergency, and therefore was not offset--spending for humanitarian aid for the Kosovar refugees, for infusions of cash into the struggling farm credit system, for helping areas hit by natural disaster. The 
   point or order would also have brought down domestic spending that was not an emergency, but that the Appropriations Committee went to great pains to offset. There are over $2 billion in offsets in this bill, and the great majority come from cuts in nondefense programs. 
   So, while I understand Senator GRAMM's desire to make this bill fiscally honest and responsible, I cannot support his methods. Instead, we should defeat this bill and start again--passing only what the Department of Defense says they need to continue their operations in Kosovo, only what is truly a domestic emergency, only what is non-emergency and offset. 
   I have voted in support of the use of air power in Kosovo, a decision I made solemnly, and I am willing to vote to support funding the mission. This conference report, however, contains money the Pentagon never asked for and that will never have an impact on the situation in Kosovo. Almost five billion dollars in non-emergency defense spending has been attached to the President's request without even allowing the Senate an opportunity to vote or debate these additions. Calling some of these new military construction projects an ``emergency'' is shameful. Those projects cannot compare with the urgency in hurricane ravaged Central America, the economic hardship faced by our family farms, or the plight of refugees on the desolate hillsides of Albania. 
   Obviously a great deal of munitions, fuel, and material have been expended in our mission over Yugoslavia. The need to fund these operations, however, should not be an excuse to fund other special-interest projects that were never high enough priorities to be placed in the tight military budget. Suddenly these projects are so important they are given emergency designation, when a few months ago they hardly deserved mentioning, and were certainly not worth including in the budget resolution Congress adopted in March. 
   It is wrong for those who want a much larger defense budget to hold hostage the emergency funds needed for the Kosovo operation, Central America, and the devastated rural America--and it is wrong to go to the American taxpayers to pay their ransom. 
   Thus, it is with some regret that I must vote against this conference report. Regret, because there are a number of very good things in this bill, 
    including funding that I worked hard to ensure would be there to help respond to the desperate situation of our family farmer. 
   This bill provides $43 million for Farm Service Agency personnel and $110 million and for the farm credit program requested by the Administration in response to the tremendous credit crunch facing our Nation's farmers. The Farm Service Agency funds are needed to provide the support staff so USDA can deliver disaster assistance promised to farmers last fall. The additional $110 million for USDA's farm credit program will provide essential loan guarantees to farmers as they struggle through historically low prices. 
   The conference report also includes $63 million for FY 1999 and FY 2000 to  allow the USDA to provide technical assistance to landowners as they enroll in USDA's Natural Resource Conservation Service environmental programs. Because of funding shortfalls, Wisconsin's NRCS has already stopped providing technical assistance. That means thousands of acres of land, ready to be returned to their pristine state through the joint efforts of farmers and the USDA, are lying fallow. 
   Finally, I want to highlight another provision I worked on in this conference report: food assistance to the Kosovar refugees. We have all seen the news accounts, the pictures, and have heard the terrible stories of tragedy that the people in the Balkans are facing daily. Reports from that region include hunger as another major problem that is hitting hardest among the children, the elderly, and the most vulnerable. Humanitarian food assistance, or PL-480 funds, have been diverted to Kosovo from other regions of the world where serious needs exist. Funding for Kosovo food assistance was not included in initial versions of this bill, but without it, people in Africa, Bangladesh, and other troubled regions will continue to suffer from hunger and deprivation. It is never good policy or sense to rob Peter to pay Paul, but it is disgraceful when Peter and Paul are innocent, starving children on opposite sides of the world. 
   However, even with all these good things, this conference report is the harbinger of terrible things to come. By trying to slip so much non-emergency spending into this bill, the conference committee has acknowledged that we cannot meet the genuine needs of our citizens within the budget that was laid out in March. 
   Mr. President, the American people deserve an honest budget, and they deserve to know that we will meet their emergencies in a forthright manner. I regret that we could not do that today. If we pass this conference report, we will further and deservedly lose the trust of those who send us their hard earned tax dollars. I urge my colleagues to vote no.

   Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for her comments and I understand her concern about the need to provide debris removal assistance following the violent storms in her state and other states. The amendment of the Senator, to which she refers, would have expanded the statutory authority of NRCS to exercise debris removal activities on lands not covered by current law. This would not only have included the lands of which the Senator speaks, but could be interpreted to cover a wide array of other lands. It is our understanding that statutory authority does exist for the debris removal activities about which the Senator speaks, making bill language unnecessary. However, certain administrative actions by the Department will be necessary before these activities can be carried out. 
   From time to time, we are asked to provide emergency funds in response to natural disasters. Too often, there is a human cost to these disasters that we have no power to compensate. In other instances, the level of our assistance is appropriate and necessary for the task. There are times, however, when the sums required could have been reduced had a little prevention been in place before the crisis struck. 
   Obviously, the force of a tornado is such that mankind may never be able to control or overcome. The devastation we all have witnessed this Spring in several states including Arkansas, and more recently Oklahoma and Kansas, was of such a magnitude in economic and human costs that calls for our assistance must not go unheard. Now, however, we are faced with choices about actions that might, at this point, prevent future damage and future costs. 
   The debris of which the Senator describes is not only that which currently is obstructing stream flows or causing flooding or erosion, but it also includes debris located in the immediate vicinity of those streams and waterways. It takes little imagination to envision another, far less intensive storm in the region that would cause that debris to be removed directly into the steambed with substantial damage and cost as a result, costs for which we and the American taxpayers might very well be asked to compensate in the near future. in this case, a little prevention today may save substantial sums tomorrow. That is why the Senator is precisely correct and why we must ensure these needs are met. 
   The conference report now before the Senate does not include the bill language the Senator offered earlier due to the fact that, as mentioned above, the statutory authority for those activities of concern to her and to others currently exists. The Statement of Managers makes that point. However, the purpose of her amendment is well taken in bringing to the attention of the Department that necessary administrative actions must be taken immediately to address the emergency situation that remains. We do not here suggest that the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations authorities be broadened to include ``any'' lands. Instead, it is important for us all to recognize that reasonable steps by the Department should be taken to remove the debris in question before it becomes the cause of more substantial losses in the future.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of the juvenile crime bill, S. 254, because on balance it comes close enough to promoting the kind of approach that we need to reduce juvenile violence--the type of plan that is already working to reduce crime in cities like Milwaukee and Boston, and the type of strategy that will help us prevent future tragedies like the recent school shootings in Jonesboro, AR, Peducah, KY, Springfield, OR, Conyers, GA and Littleton, CO. There are many causes of juvenile crime--poverty, a deterioration of American families and family values, increased youth access to firearms, and the explosion of violent images in our culture, just to name a few--and it would be naive to presume there is a simple solution. Indeed, we need a comprehensive crime-fighting strategy to address all of these root causes and the entire range of juvenile offenders and potential offenders, from violent predators to children at-risk of becoming delinquent. That is the approach this bill takes, more or less. 
   Let me explain the four keys to this balanced, proven strategy: keeping guns out of the hands of kids and of criminals; punishment; prevention; and reducing kids' exposure to violence in our culture. 
   First, this bill will help keep firearms out of the hands of young people. It promotes gun safety with the Kohl/Hatch/Chafee amendment to require the sale of child safety locks with every new handgun. Child safety locks can help save many of the 500 children and teenagers killed each year in firearms accidents, and the 1,500 kids each year who use guns to commit suicide. Just as importantly, they can help prevent some of the 7,000 violent juvenile crimes committed every year with guns children took from their own homes. This measure passed with an overwhelming 78 votes, twice the number of votes a virtually identical proposal received last year. 
   The bill also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we can put them out of business and behind bars. Through the ``Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative,'' the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has been working closely with cities like Milwaukee and Boston to trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using ATF's national database, police and prosecutors can target illegal suppliers of firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our communities. While I served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for Treasury Appropriations, we provided funding to expand this initiative to 27 cities. This measure will expand the program to up to 200 other cities and, with the increased penalties outlined above, help stanch illegal gun trafficking. 
   And not only will this bill prohibit all violent criminals from owning firearms, no matter what their age, through ``Project CUFF'' it also encourages aggressive enforcement of this federal law by dedicating federal prosecutors and investigators to this task. This builds on a successful program, supported by the NRA, that has helped reduce gun violence in 
   Richmond, Va., and Boston through increased federal prosecution, close coordination with state officials, public outreach and fewer plea bargains. Still, to be truly effective, this measure needs to be improved, so that we don't force it on uncooperating cities where it's unlikely to succeed. 
   Unfortunately, the bill fails in its stated intent to close an inexcusable loophole that allows violent young offenders to buy guns legally when they turn eighteen. Under current law, violent adult offenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles can--for example, even the kids convicted of the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, Arkansas--once they are released at age eighteen. Simply put, this has to stop, and the bill tries to do this--sort of. A provision declares that all violent felons are disqualified from buying firearms, regardless of whether they were 10, 12, or just a day short of their 18th birthday at the time of their offense. However, although the bill technically closes this loophole, because it only applies to violent crimes committed once juvenile records become ``routinely available'' on-line, its indefinite effective date merely opens another loophole in its place. This provision may never take effect. When juvenile records are all ``on-line'' is a long way away, and in the meantime many young criminals will continue to have the ability to get a gun at 18 once they get out of jail. 
   Each of these provisions was addressed in my juvenile crime bill, the 21st Century Safe and Sound Communities Act. In addition, after much back-and-forth--and forth-and-back--we finally agreed to close the gun show loophole once and for all. I am pleased to see a bipartisan consensus start to emerge over taking these steps to keep guns out of young hands. 
   Second, we need to lock up the worst offenders, including dangerous violent juveniles. Naturally, we can't even begin to stop violent kids unless we have police officers on the street to catch them, and the state and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts we need to try them. To that end, this bill provides $100 million per year for state and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts for juveniles. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to extend the highly successful COPS program--which is due to expire after next year--in this bill. Extending the COPS program will make it easier to lock up dangerous juveniles, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen. 
   Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a place to send them. So this measure dedicates funding for juvenile prisons or alternative placements of delinquent children--a long-needed measure for which I have advocated since before the 1994 Crime Act. 
   This proposal also helps rural communities keep dangerous kids behind bars. Now, although the closest juvenile facility may be hundreds of miles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up violent juveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This 
   means that state law enforcement officials either have to waste the time and resources to criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply let dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. This measure gives rural police the flexibility they need by letting them detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 48 hours, or longer with parental consent, provided they are separated from adult criminals. Working with Wisconsin's rural sheriffs, I first proposed a similar extension three years ago. 
   Moreover, this measure will help lock up gun-toting kids--and the people who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 Youth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by a minor into a felony. And the same goes for anyone who illegally sells handguns to kids. Both of these provisions were in my juvenile crime bill. Kids and handguns don't mix, and our Federal law needs to make clear that this is a serious crime.  
   In addition, this measure makes it easier to identify the violent juveniles who need to be dealt with more severely--by strongly encouraging states to share the records of juvenile offenders and providing the funding necessary for improved record-keeping. The fact is that law enforcement officials need full disclosure to make informed judgments about who should be incarcerated, but current law allows too many records to be concealed or to vanish without a trace when a teen felon turns eighteen. 
   Finally, this measure includes my proposal, cosponsored by Senator DEWINE: the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999, which will promote the use of modern DNA technology to resolve unsolved crimes committed by both juveniles and adults. Our measure will reduce the backlog of hundreds of thousands of unanalyzed DNA samples from convicted offenders by providing the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ``on-line,'' so they can be shared between states and matched with crime scene DNA evidence. And, while all 50 states authorize collection of DNA samples, it closes the loophole that allows DNA samples from Federal and Washington, D.C. offenders to go uncollected. The Department of Justice estimates that upgrading our DNA databases alone could solve a minimum of 600 crimes tomorrow. 
   Third, a balanced approach also requires a significant investment in crime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. In fact, no one is more adamant in support of this approach than our nation's law enforcement officials. For example, last year more than 400 police chiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors nationwide endorsed a call for after-school programs for all children. And in my home state of Wisconsin, 90 percent of police chiefs and sheriffs I surveyed agreed that we need to increase federal prevention spending. 
   This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in programs that already have a record of success and those that rely on proven strategies, like the ones that give 
   children a safe place to go in the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when juvenile crime peaks. 
   For example, it includes my amendment to expand the Families and Schools Together (FAST) program, a successful program that finds troubled youth and reconnects them with their schools and families. FAST, which was created in my home state of Wisconsin and is already being implemented in 484 schools in 34 States and five countries, helps ensure that youth violence does not proliferate to our schools and communities by empowering parents, helping to improve children's behavior and performance in school, preventing substance abuse, and providing support and networking for families by linking them to community resources and services. 
   The bill also promotes innovative prevention initiatives by reauthorizing and expanding the Prevention Challenge Grant program (formerly known as Title V), which former Senator Hank Brown and I authored in 1992. This program encourages investment, collaboration, and long-range prevention planning by local communities, who must establish locally tailored prevention programs and contribute at least 50 cents for every federal dollar. And, in response to concerns I raised about the risk of watering down this program with non-prevention uses, 80 percent of its funding is reserved for prevention--that is, programs addressing at-risk kids before they ever enter the juvenile justice system. 
   It also builds on our support for the valuable work of Boys & Girls Clubs by continuing to dedicate funding to the Clubs and expanding funding to other successful organizations like the YMCA. And it requires that at least 25 percent of $450 million juvenile accountability block grant be dedicated to prevention. 
   Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just because they sound good. Quality matters. And it would foolish to throw good money after bad. That's why this measure requires at least 5 percent of all Prevention Challenge Grant funds--and more than 15 percent of FAST funds--be set aside for rigorous evaluations, so we can keep funding the programs that work, and zero out programs that don't. 
   Finally, this bill also aims to provide us with a better understanding of how violence in our culture is marketed to children, and it encourages industry to take self-regulatory steps to reduce this violence. For example, the Brownback amendment, which I consponsored, orders a joint FTC/DOJ study of the marketing practices of the video game, motion picture, and television industries to determine whether or not the industries are peddling violence to kids. In particular, it will help us determine whether or not the industries are peddling violence to kids. In particular, it will help us determine whether the video game industry is marketing the same ultraviolent games to children that are rated ``adults only.'' 
   Mr. President, while explaining what causes a tragedy like Littleton remains a mystery, the question about how to reduce juvenile crime no longer is. We have a good idea about 
   what works. And this bill overall is a step in the right direction. Like any piece of legislation, of course, it isn't perfect. For example, we need to really close the loophole that allows violent juvenile offenders to buy guns. We need to extend the COPS program so that we have enough police officers on the streets to catch and lock up dangerous juveniles and criminals. We should restore the so-called ``mandate'' requiring states to make efforts to reduce disproportionate minority confinement. This requirement, which I helped write in 1992, at most simply encourages states to address prevention efforts at minority communities. And it may be most important for its symbolic recognition of continuing racial divisions that dominate our society and our justice system, whether or not the justice system is actually discriminatory. Still, it makes no sense to cast away this provision without any hearings, any organized opposition, or any constitutional challenges to it over its seven-year history. I am hopeful that the House, which has always been supportive of this provision, will insist on restoring it in Conference. 
   And while the bill is a step forward for prevention, we can still do better. Although some suggest that as much as 55 percent of the $1 billion in spending at the heart of the bill goes toward prevention, in reality less than 30 percent is dedicated to prevention ($160 million through the 80 percent set-aside of the Prevention Challenge Grant, $112.5 million through the 25 percent earmark from the Accountability Block Grant, and $15 million for mentoring). To effectively reduce juvenile crime, the ratio of prevention spending to enforcement spending has to be a lot higher. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators HATCH and LEAHY, and their staffs--Beryl Howell, Manus Cooney, Rhett DeHart, Mike Kennedy, Bruce Cohen, Ed Pagano, Craig Wolf, and, of course, Brian Lee, Jessica Catlin, Kahau Morrison and Jon Leibowitz of my staff--for their hard work in putting together this balanced bill, which is significant improvement from where we were headed last Congress. I look forward to continuing to work with them when we move to conference.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation because it will increase competition between satellite and cable. Senators MCCAIN, HATCH, LEAHY, HOLLINGS, DEWINE and others deserve credit for moving this measure so quickly this term, especially when we came so close last year. 
   Mr. President, when the Judiciary and Commerce bills are combined as one, it creates a good, comprehensive measure. Satellite companies will finally be allowed to legally broadcast local stations to local viewers--so-called ``local into local.'' The strange anomaly that restricted satellite from providing local signals will be a thing of the past. And to be balanced, satellite companies will also be subject to ``must-carry'' obligations, just like cable. This bill will also reduce the royalty fees for those local signals to a level closer to that paid by cable companies. All of this moves us towards parity between satellite and cable, and it is a huge step forward for consumers. Let me tell you why. 
   Increased competition will discipline the cable marketplace which, in turn, will create lower prices, increased choice, and wider availability of television programming for all Americans, no matter how remote. And we do this in the best way possible, by promoting competition, not increasing regulation. Moreover, it won't be at the expense of our local television stations, which provide a valuable community benefit in the form of local news, weather, sports and various forms of public service. 
   One of the hardest questions to address, of course, is which viewers should be entitled to receive ``distant network'' signals, especially in rural states like mine. Authorizing ``local into local'' is a crucial first step and, eventually, when technology advances and more satellites are launched, we will see ``local into local'' almost everywhere. So, this bill goes a long way to ensure that every viewer will receive one signal of each of the major television networks--this is a marked improvement over the current situation. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure which will permit satellite companies to compete on a more level playing field with cable. We have our work cut out for us at conference because the House version is quite different from ours. But there is no excuse for not enacting this pro-competition, pro-consumer legislation this year. Let's get to conference and get this bill done.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation to the managers of this bill for agreeing to include in the manager's package my amendment to authorize the FAST (Families and Schools Together) program. 
   Over the last few weeks, we have all spent much time mourning lost children--whether they are lost to bullets or to the lure of a violent culture, whether they end their lives holding a gun or facing one. And we have spent much time discussing the many factors that can lead our young people to become lost. We can blame guns, or mindless T.V., or savage movies, or violent video games, or illegal drugs. But we know that a child is most likely to be lost--most likely to fall under the influence of these evils--when he or she is alone, cut off from parents, teachers, and the community. 
   FAST is a successful program that finds troubled youth and reconnects them with their schools and families. FAST brings at-risk children, parents, and educators together to help them learn to succeed at home, in school, and in their communities. FAST helps ensure that youth violence does not proliferate to our schools and communities by empowering parents, helping to improve children's behavior and performance in school, preventing substance abuse, and providing support and networking for families by linking them to community resources and services. 
   Currently, the FAST program--which was created in my home state of Wisconsin--is being implemented in 484 schools in 34 States and five countries. It has received numerous national honors and awards, and is supported by the Department of Education, Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, Office of National Drug Control Policy, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, National Institute of Mental Health, Head Start, the Harvard/Ford Foundation, and the United Way of America. 
   My amendment is simple and effective. It authorizes $12 million a year for the next five years to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Programs in the Department of Justice for FAST sites and programs. Of this amount, $10 million will go toward the implementation of local FAST sites and programs and $2 million will be used for research and evaluation of FAST. This amendment will allow more communities across the nation to reap the benefits of FAST--and will go a long way toward preventing youth violence in this country. 
   Mr. President, one of the best ways to prevent youth violence is by building and preserving close, healthy relationships within families. The FAST program is instrumental in achieving this goal, and has been proven to work in reducing behavioral problems among troubled youth. I am pleased that Senators HATCH and LEAHY have recognized the importance of this small, yet vitally important program by including the FAST amendment in the manager's package. I thank them for their efforts in working with me on this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mary Broydrick, Michelle Hill, Day Manoli, Nick Nielsen, all seniors, and Gus Fuldner, a junior, each received a $10,000 scholarship for their presentation on monetary policy. The team was coached by John Stephens, a teacher at University School for 41 years. In addition, the school received a $40,000 grant to develop an economics lab. 
   Their winning presentation included countless hours researching economic and monetary policy. Making recommendations based on their findings, the team was asked a series of grueling questions by Federal Reserve officials. 
   We are all extremely proud of our students from University School. They must be applauded for a job well done.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, our amendment is a reasonable, bipartisan measure that will help protect children from the countless accidental deaths, suicides and violent crimes that result from improperly stored handguns. Simply put, it would require that every handgun be sold with a child safety device, but leaves the decision about whether to use a safety device to individual gun owners. Here's why we believe you should support it. 
   First, we've added a section that extends limited liability protection to gun owners who lock up their handguns properly. This liability protection is very narrow--it does not extend any immunity to manufacturers, and it does not apply if the gun owner acted negligently. We believe that this provision actually improves the bill by creating incentives to use child safety locks. 
   Second, the American people overwhelmingly support it. According to a recent Newsweek poll, 85 percent of the American public backs legislation requiring the sale of child safety locks with new handguns. 
   Third, despite the pledges of some of the largest manufacturers to sell safety locks with every handgun, most manufacturers are still not including safety locks. In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported, ``only a handful of the arms makers who eventually signed on are complying, according to industry insiders.'' 
   Fourth, and most importantly, child safety locks will help save lives. Each year, nearly 500 children and teenagers are killed in gun-related accidents, thousands are injured, and approximately 1,500 children and teenagers commit suicide with guns. Perhaps as disturbing, nearly 7,000 violent crimes each year are committed by juveniles using guns they found in their own homes. 
   Just last weekend, a 7-year-old Milwaukee boy named Brian Welch killed himself accidentally with a gun he found in his father's drawer. What do we say to Brian's family, if we cannot takes steps as reasonable as this one? 
   You know, Mr. President, in the past few weeks there's been a lot of discussion about Republicans and ``gun control.'' Hardly a talk show goes by without a pundit opining on whether it's a true epiphany or a ``poll-driven ploy.'' Well, cynics can believe whatever they want. But my sense is that, in the wake of Littleton, both sides have grown up a bit: Democrats in acknowledging that culture has something to do with juvenile violence today; and Republicans in endorsing reasonable measures to take handguns out of the hands of kids who shouldn't have them. 
   So I applaud all of those on both sides of the aisle who have ``converted'' on safety locks. I appreciate those who have been with us from the beginning, including our cosponsor Senator CHAFEE, who has been so resolute in support of reasonable gun control measures. And I credit Chairman HATCH, Senator LEAHY, and Senator CRAIG for their work in making this a better amendment. And one that we all believe will shortly become law.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his question. I am indeed familiar with Saf-T-Hammer and share the Senator's enthusiasm for the promise of handgun safety that this device offers. I commend the intent of the developers of the device to safeguard the lives of innocent children and others who might otherwise be killed or injured by handguns. 
   I can assure the Senator from Arizona that it is indeed the intention of the amendment that devices such as Saf-T-Hammer, an easily removable hammer, are included within the purview of the amendment. I also believe that on its face the definition of a safety device in 18 U.S.C. 921(34) would include a device such as Saf-T-Hammer. Accordingly, when a handgun is manufactured or retrofitted with Saf-T-Hammer, it would be, under the terms of the amendment, exempt from the amendment's prohibitions on transfer. Handguns so equipped with a Saf-T-Hammer may be freely transferred under the amendment. 
   I hope this answers your question and clarifies the legislative intent of the amendment.

But after a week of back-and-forth--and forth-and-back--over firearms, it is good to see a consensus developing on at least this commonsense measure to keep handguns away from children. Simply put, the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment will ensure that a child safety device--or trigger lock--is sold with every handgun. 
   This proposal will move us forward today, and it will help save lives. I hope we can all support it.

So I rise now, with my colleague, Senator HATCH, to offer the Safe Handgun Storage and Child Handgun Safety Act of 1999. 
   This measure is closely modeled on the Child Safety Lock Act which I introduced earlier this year, with Senators CHAFEE, FEINSTEIN, DURBIN, and BOXER. Senator CHAFEE is also a cosponsor of this amendment. 
   Briefly, our amendment will bring the entire industry up to the level of those responsible manufacturers who have already started including child safety locks with their handguns. It is a commonsense idea, not an extreme one, that will reduce gun-related accidents, suicides, and homicides by young people. 
   Don't take my word for it. Ask your own constituents. According to a recent Newsweek poll, 85 percent of the American people support this proposal. 
   Our amendment is simple, effective, and straightforward. While we want people to use child safety locks, our amendment doesn't mandate it. Instead, our measure simply requires that whenever a handgun is sold, a child safety device must also be sold. 
   These devices vary in form, and effective ones are available for less than $10. We have added a new section that gives limited liability to gun owners, but only if they store their handguns properly. This actually creates an incentive for more people to use safety locks. 
   Let me tell you briefly why this amendment is so much needed. Nearly 2,000 young people are killed each year in firearm accidents and suicides. This is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. While our proposal is certainly not a panacea, it will help prevent many of these tragedies. 
   Mr. President, safety locks will also reduce violent crime. Juveniles commit nearly 7,000 crimes each year with guns taken from their own homes. That doesn't include incidents like last year's school shooting in Jonesboro, AR, which involved guns taken from the home of one child's grandfather because most of the father's guns actually were locked up. 
   A few extremists on both sides may not agree, but this is clearly a step forward. It will help make children safer. It will help make mothers and fathers feel more secure leaving their children at a neighbor's home. Senator CRAIG, who worked with me in 1994 to author the ban on juvenile possession of handguns, deserves much credit today. When passed, this law will be a huge victory for our children and a victory for bipartisanship as well. I hope my colleagues can all support this bill. 
   At this point, Mr. President, I send the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment to the desk.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with my colleagues Senator DODD of Connecticut and Senator ROCKEFELLER of West Virginia, to provide more resources to America's children and families by encouraging more parents to live up to their child support obligations. My legislation, the Children First Child Support Reform Act, would enhance the options and incentives available to states to allow more child support to be paid directly to the families to whom it is owed and not be counted against public assistance benefits. My legislation will help assure more noncustodial parents that the child support they pay will actually contribute to the wellbeing of their child, rather than the government, and also help reduce administrative burdens on the state. 
   As my colleagues know, since its inception in 1975, our Federal-State Child Support Enforcement Program has been tasked with collecting child support for families receiving public assistance and other families that request help in enforcing child support. Toward this end, the program works to establish paternity and legally binding support orders, while collecting and disbursing funds on behalf of families so that children receive the support they need to grow up in healthy, nurturing surroundings. 
   But on one crucial point, the current program does not truly work on behalf of families and, perhaps more importantly, actually works against families. 
   Under current law, if a family is not on public assistance, support collected by the Child Support Enforcement Program is generally sent directly to the family. However, and this is the crux of the problem, support collected on behalf of families receiving public assistance is kept by the State and Federal Governments as reimbursement for welfare expenditures. Thus, for families on public assistance, the child support program ends up benefiting the financial interests of the government, rather than their children. 
   The research shows that many noncustodial parents are discouraged from paying child support because they realize and resent the fact that their payments go to the government rather than benefiting their children directly. In addition, some custodial parents are skeptical about working with the child support agency to secure payments since the funds are generally not forwarded to them. Obviously, these builtin program obstacles to reliable, timely child support payments serve to undermine the program's intended goals of promoting self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. 
   Mr. President, we know that an estimated 800,000 families would not need public assistance if they could count on the child support owed to them. In addition, we know that 23 million children are owed more than $43 billion in outstanding support. Clearly, the vital importance of child support in keeping families off of assistance remains as true today as when the program began. In a world with TANF time limits, it has never been more important. And with these figures in mind, it is not unthinkable that some policymakers may have or might still consider this program as a means of recovering welfare expenditures. 
   But I am convinced that that thinking must change, if not be cast off entirely, because, simply put, times have changed. The welfare reform law of 1996, which I supported, paved the way for time limits and work requirements that provide clear and compelling incentives for families to enter the workforce and find a way to stay there. Open ended, unconditional public support is no longer a reality, and our goal and responsibility as policymakers, now more than ever before, is to give families the tools and resources they need to prepare for and ultimately survive the day when they are without public assistance. 
   We fundamentally changed welfare, now we fundamentally reexamine the central role of child support in helping families as they struggle to become and remain self-sufficient. To this end, we've made some, but not nearly enough, progress. Under the welfare reform law, states will eventually be required to distribute state-collected child support arrears owed to the family before paying off arrears owed to the state and Federal governments for welfare expenditures. In addition, states were provided with some ability to continue or expand the $50 passthrough that had been required under previous law. But only one state--my homestate of Wisconsin--has opted to let families retain all support paid. As you know, Wisconsin has been a leader and national model in the area of welfare reform. Under Wisconsin's welfare program, child support counts as income in determining financial eligibility for welfare assistance, but once eligibility is established, the child support income is disregarded in calculating program benefits. In other words, families are allowed to keep their own money. Non-custodial parents can be assured that their contribution counts and that their child support payments go to their children. And both parents are presented with a realistic picture of what that support means in the life of their child. 
   I worked with Wisconsin to secure the waivers necessary to pursue this innovative policy and want to provide the other states with additional flexibility and options so that they can follow Wisconsin's example. 
   In addition to helping families, the expanded passthrough and disregard approach also has significant benefits on the administrative side. The current distribution requirements place significant accounting and paperwork burdens on the states. They are also costly. Data from the Federal Office of Child Support demonstrates that nearly 20 percent of program expenditures are spent simply processing payments. States are required to maintain a complicated set of accounts to determine whether support collected should be paid to the family or kept by the government. These complex accounting rules depend on whether the family ever received public assistance, the date a family begins and ends assistance, whether the non-custodial parent is current on payments or owes arrears, the method of collection and other factors. 
   We know that we have already asked much of the states in the realm of automation, systems integration and welfare law child support enforcement adjustments. We hope and believe these improvements will lead to better collection rates. Now we have a chance to simplify and improve distribution of support. What could be simpler than a distribution system in which child support collected would automatically be delivered to the children to whom it is owed? A distribution system in which child support agencies would distribute current support and arrears to both welfare and non-welfare families in exactly the same way? 
   Mr. President, child support financing must be addressed in the near future. 
   First, our current distribution scheme is out of step with the philosophy of current welfare policy. We must move the child support program from cost-recovery to service delivery for all families. Second, the current financing scheme is no longer workable. TANF caseloads are decreasing dramatically, even as overall child support caseloads are increasing. Therefore, while the system needs additional resources, the portion of the caseload that produces those resources is decreasing. We must put the child support program on a sound financial footing that confirms a strong Federal and state commitment to the program and gives states additional flexibility to put more resources into the hands of children and let families keep more of their own money. 
   Let me strongly affirm that by advocating an expanded passthrough and disregard approach, I am absolutely not advocating a disinvestment in our child support system by either the Federal government or the states. Our commitment to this program must remain strong and steadfast. I am working to expand the passthrough for the reasons that I've explained, but I am also committed to paying for it in a responsible way. Not knowing what the proposal will cost today necessarily requires that we keep ourselves open to adjustments as the debate proceeds. 
   That said, it is time for us to envision a child support program that truly serves families and works to advance, not undermine, the TANF policy goals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility with which it is inextricably  combined. Because assistance is now time-limited, we must give families the tools to survive in a world without public help, a world where they must rely on their own resources. In that equation, we all know that child support is fundamental. Letting as many as 5 years go by with child support payments either not being or accuring to the state rather than the family does nothing to advance those goals. 
   Mr. President, it's time to put our children first and envision a child support program that truly serves families. We can do that by passing this legislation to improve the public system, let families keep more of their own money, and make child support truly meaningful in the everyday lives of children on public assistance.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to cosponsor this measure, which aims to provide us with a better understanding of how violence in our culture is marketed to children and encourage industry to take self-regulatory steps to reduce this violence. Just as important, it will help us determine whether the video game industry is breaking its promise and targeting ultraviolent games to minors. 
   Mr. President, as we look to find meaning--or to develop policy--in the wake of the Littleton tragedy, it is clear that there's no single answer as to how we can prevent such a terrible event from happening again. Indeed, throughout my time in the Senate, I've worked very hard for a comprehensive approach: Prevention programs for at-risk kids, laws that try to restrict minors from getting handguns, strong punishments for folks who use guns to commit a crime and for truly violent juveniles, and reasonable restrictions on providing inappropriate information to children. My sense is that by the time we complete action on this juvenile justice bill, many of these issues will be addressed in productive, bipartisan ways. 
   But one part of this comprehensive approach that I'll focus on today is the marketing of violence to children, especially in ultraviolent video games. Senator LIEBERMAN and I have worked very hard on this issue for quite some time, and we've made some progress since we first held joint hearings on the video game industry back in 1993. Since then, the industry has rated all games, giving parents a far better sense of what they are buying for their kids. Recently, though, we have seen  some disturbing signs of ``backsliding,'' especially on enforcement of the ratings system. 
   Let me give you just a few examples. The Interactive Digital Software Association--which represents video game manufacturers--has an Advertising Code of Conduct that says, ``Companies should not specifically target advertising to [underage] consumers.'' But the companies who produce games like ``Duke Nukem'' and ``Resident Evil''--both rated ``M'' for age seventeen and up--sell action figures from their games at Toys-R-Us to much younger children. 
   That is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. 
   Make no mistake about it: Though these games are for adults, the manufacturers are marketing to our kids. That's why we think an FTC/DOJ study--one that separates out the bad actors from the good ones and gives this disturbing trend the scrutiny it deserves--is not just an appropriate response, it is also a timely one. And while the evidence is much clearer with respect to video games than other forms of entertainment, what harm can there be in a study? It might just prove some folks in the industry are doing a good job. 
   Mr. President, this amendment also includes an antitrust exemption for the entertainment industry so its members can collaborate on a ``code of conduct'' and how best to implement the various ratings systems. It is not entirely clear that the industry actually needs this ``safe harbor,'' but again, there is no harm to reenacting and expanding Senator SIMON's measure. 
   Of course, Mr. President, these measures are certainly no panacea--no law can be. But they each represent a small step that we in Congress can take as our national community gains a better understanding of what kind of violent images our children face today and what effect it is having on them. For if we do not take the time to learn more about the root causes of youth violence and, instead, blindly make scapegoats out of games or artists or movies we simply don't like, we might as well know nothing at all. Thank you.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation that would give a Congressional ``stamp of approval'' to a settlement for which the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin has long awaited--a settlement that, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Federal Court that approved it last year, is long overdue. 
   Specifically, this bill--the ``Menominee Tribal Fairness Act of 1999''--would enforce a settlement owed to the Menominee Tribe by the Federal government, whose termination of the Tribe's federal trust status resulted in enormous damage to the Menominee from 1954 to 1973. Six years ago, Congress passed a congressional reference that ordered the U.S. Claims Court to report back regarding what damages, if any, were owed the Tribe. Last year, the Court approved a $32 million settlement, and now that we have settled the merits of the case, we simply need congressional approval to conclude this 45-year-old matter once and for all. Let me tell you why this legislation is crucially needed. 
   When Congress passed the Menominee Termination Act of June 13, 1954, it ended the Tribe's federal trust status, effective in 1961. As a result of termination, the Menominee Tribe plunged into years of severe impoverishment and community turmoil. Indeed, according to a 1965 BIA study of conditions on the former reservation, the economic and social effects were disastrous. Unemployment was 26 percent, compared to Wisconsin's 5 percent rate. The school dropout rate was 75 percent, and the per capita income was less than one-third of the state average. The local hospital, which was built with tribal funds, was shut down because it could not meet state standards, effectively eliminating local health care services which in turn increased mortality rates. 
   Twelve years after termination, Congress recognized the economic and social devastation this Act had caused for the Tribe by passing the Menominee Restoration Act of 1973, which reinstated the Tribe's federal trust status. Clearly, though, BIA mismanagement and termination threatened to devastate the Tribe for generations to  come, and the Tribe subsequently sought relief for its recuperation. 
   The Menominee Tribe took this matter to the courts, and though it obtained favorable trial court judgments on the merits of its claims, the Tribe encountered a series of technical roadblocks that prevented it from ever really having its case heard. 
   The Tribe then came to Congress for help. But it was not until 1993 that Congress passed my proposal to settle this matter by sending it to the Court of Claims and ordering the court to report back what damages the Tribe was owed. 
   After extensive negotiation, the Federal government and the Menominee Tribe agreed upon a settlement of the Tribe's claims for a sum of $32,052,547. The Claims Court, on August 12, 1998, reported back to Congress, concluding that the Tribe has stated legitimate claims and endorsing this settlement. 
   Now, to compensate the Tribe for damages and implement the decision of the Court of Claims, we must pass this legislation that authorizes the payment of this agreed-to settlement. And the money does not have to be appropriated--it will simply be taken from a Treasury Department ``judgment fund'' account. 
   Mr. President, the congressional reference procedure is designed so that the court may examine claims against the United States based on negligence or fault, or based on less than fair and honorable dealings, regardless of ``technical'' defenses that the United States may otherwise assert, especially the statute of limitations. 
   In other words, it is to be used for precisely the types of circumstances surrounding the Menominee Tribe. The tribe and its members suffered grievous economic loss through legislative termination of its rights and from BIA mismanagement of its resources. Indeed, the Federal governments' actions brought the Menominee Tribe to the brink of economic, social, and cultural disaster. In 1973, the tribe was restored to Federal recognition and tribal status by action of the Congress. But the Tribe has yet to be compensated for the damages it suffered. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to approve the Court's ruling, support this bill, and settle this case once and for all. And don't take my word for it--this measure has been endorsed by the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, and Representative MARK GREEN, who represents the district where the Menominee reservation is located.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the ``Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999.'' This legislation will stop the practice of giving students free sodas at lunch--sugar and caffeine filled drinks that are replacing the healthy milk and juices these kids should be drinking. A soda may keep a child awake through fifth period physics, but it will do nothing to fuel their growth into a healthy adult. We've been talking quite a bit lately about keeping our children safe during the school day. We must not forget we also have an obligation to keep them healthy, growing, and alert--an obligation met in great part with the national school lunch and breakfast programs. 
   The vast majority of schools in Wisconsin and across the nation are our partners in ensuring that children learn to eat healthy, and they are proud to abide by current laws--and the spirit behind those laws-- prohibiting the sale of foods of minimal nutritional value in our schools. But while there is a ban on the sale of these sorts of foods during the school lunch period, there is no ban on giving them away for free. The Center for Science in the Public Interest recently cited several schools that are giving away donated sodas to students. This defies common sense. Kids should be drinking milk, water, and natural fruit juices--not sodas and other artificial drinks--as part of the school lunch program. 
   Statistics from the Department of Agriculture show that 20 years ago,  teens drank twice as much milk as soft drinks; today, that trend has reversed. Teens are drinking 40 percent less milk than they drank 22 years ago. Soft drinks contain a large amount of caffeine and sugar, and the American Medical Association has found that these sweetened drinks squeeze healthier foods out of childrens diets. 
   The Better Nutrition for School Children Act will simply prohibit the donation of competitive foods of minimal nutritional value, including sodas, before the end of the last lunch period of school. Let me be clear: we are not banning sodas in schools. Students will still be able to purchase sodas, or receive free ones, once the school lunch period is over. But this bill assures that at least during mealtimes, school children will have access to healthy foods and drinks, like milk. 
   This bill does not address the exclusive marketing contracts between schools and soft drink companies, but I do have concern over these as well. These contracts specify that a school will sell only a certain brand of sodas, and in return, the soda companies give the schools a share of the proceeds. I realize that school districts' budgets are stretched thin, but there has to be a better way of raising funds. 
   Mr. President, the Better Nutrition for School Children Act will close the current loophole that allows the donation of sodas in our nation's schools. It will ensure that tax dollars invested in the school lunch program are spent wisely on nutritious foods and drinks that children actually consume--rather than throw away to make room for a free soda. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this simple, yet vitally important legislation.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bryan amendment. While my comments today will be brief, my conviction on the issue of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is strong. 
   CRA came into being in 1977 thanks to my Wisconsin colleague, Senator Bill Proxmire. While there's been talk of CRA as merely an urban concern, in fact, it has enriched and addressed inequities in both urban and rural areas in Wisconsin and across the country. We are all familiar with the numbers--more than $1 trillion in community development, small business and home mortgage loans--to communities that were once deemed unworthy. 
   CRA has been, and remains, vital to our common efforts of ensuring that credit is extended to all Americans without prejudice. But CRA lending has also proven that the ability and willpower of a borrower is often just as important, if not more important, than a loan determination based solely on income or economic history. In other words, new and innovative lending inspired by CRA has promoted fairness, but also made good business sense and delivered profits to lending institutions. And, fortunately, we've made substantial progress at making CRA compliance less burdensome. 
   While impressive, this progress has not reduced the need for an effective CRA. In 1977, Senator Proxmire's legislation was timely and appropriate, but in 1999, it has proven timeless and visionary. We are contemplating an era of more diversified, and potentially bigger, actors in the financial marketplace--one in which vigilance to ensure fair lending is all the more important. Overall, with adequate safety and soundness protections and an effective CRA, this new financial marketplace will yield benefits for consumers--more financial products delivered more conveniently and rapidly and at a better price. 
   I strongly support financial modernization and want to help send a signable, bipartisan and well-balanced piece of legislation to the President's desk. Last year, we secured a compromise bill that passed out of Committee by a vote of 16 to 2 that would have had my support. It is regrettable that this year we find this legislation and the financial industry held hostage to a counterproductive agenda to scale back CRA. 
   Financial modernization is about moving forward, paving the way for marketplace innovation and consumer benefits. But Senator GRAMM's bill and his proposed CRA restrictions move us backward. I urge my colleagues to support the Bryan amendment and ensure that CRA will remain strong and viable for all American communities, whether urban or rural, in the new financial era that we hope to create.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Sunshine in Litigation Act of 1999, a measure that addresses the growing abuse of secrecy orders issued by our Federal courts. All too often our Federal courts allow vital information that is discovered in litigation--and which directly bears on public health and safety--to be covered up, to be shielded from mothers, fathers and children whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the public officials we have asked to protect our health and safety. 
   All this happens because of the use of so-called ``protective orders''--really gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep information discovered in the course of litigation secret and undisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request to keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants threaten that, without secrecy, they will fight every document requested and will refuse to agree to a settlement. Victims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, typically they do not--because both sides have agreed, and judges have other matters to which they prefer to attend. So judges are regularly and frequently entering these protective orders, using the power of the Federal government to keep people in the dark about the dangers they face. 
   Perhaps the worst offenders are the tobacco companies. They have used protective orders not only to keep incriminating documents away from public view, but also to drive up litigation costs by preventing document sharing, effectively forcing every successive plaintiff to ``reinvent the wheel.'' One tobacco industry official even boasted, ``The aggressive posture we have taken regarding depositions and discovery in general continues to make these cases extremely burdensome and expensive for plaintiffs' lawyers, particularly sole practitioners. To paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by spending all of our money, but by making the other S.O.B. spend all his.'' 
   This systematic abuse of secrecy orders is one of the reasons that it took more than four decades of tobacco litigation to achieve a reasonable settlement. In fact, Congress and the public's shift in recent years against Big Tobacco resulted in large part from disclosure of materials that had been concealed under secrecy orders, including materials regarding youth targeting and nicotine manipulation. 
   The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public health and safety has been apparent for years. The Judiciary Committee first held hearings on this issue in 1990 and again in 1994. In 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, told us, ``The one thing we learned ..... is that this problem is far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the length and depth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of civil litigation in this country is taking place in secret.'' 
   Four years later, attorney Gerry Spence told us about 19 cases in which he had been involved where his clients had been required to sign secrecy agreements. They included cases involving defects in a hormonal pregnancy test that caused severe birth defects, a defective braking system on a steamroller, and an improperly manufactured tire rim. 
   But that's not surprising, because individual examples of this problem abound. For over a decade, Miracle Recreation, a U.S. playground equipment company, marketed a merry-go-round that caused serious injury to scores of small children--including severed fingers and feet. Lawsuits brought against the manufacturer were confidentially settled, preventing the public and the Consumer Products Safety Commission from learning about the hazard. It 
   took more than a decade for regulators to discover the danger and for the company to recall the merry-go-round. 
   There are yet more cases like these. In 1973, GM allegedly began marketing vehicles with dangerously placed fuel tanks that tended to rupture, burn, and explode on impact more frequently than regular tanks. Soon after these vehicles hit the American road, tragic accidents began occurring, and lawsuits were filed. More than 150 lawsuits were settled confidentially by GM. For years this secrecy prevented the public from learning of the alleged dangers presented by these vehicles--millions of which are still on the road. It wasn't until a 1993 trail that the public learned about sidesaddle gas tanks and some GM crash test data that demonstrated these dangers. 
   The thrust of our legislation is straightforward. In cases affecting public health and safety, Federal courts would be required to apply a balancing test: they could permit secrecy only if  the need for privacy outweighs the public need to know about potential health or safety hazards. Moreover, all courts--both Federal and state--would be prohibited from issuing protective orders that prevent disclosure to regulatory agencies. In this way, our bill will bring crucial information out of the darkness and into the light. 
   Although this law may result in some small additional burden on judges, a little extra work seems a tiny price to pay to protect blameless people from danger. Every day, in the course of litigation, judges make tough calls about how to construe the public interest and interpret other laws that Congress passes. I am confident that the courts will administer this law fairly and sensibly. If this requires extra work, then that work is well worth the effort. After all, no one argues that spoiled meat should be allowed on the market because stricter regulations mean more work for FDA meat inspectors. 
   Having said all this, we must in fairness recognize that there is another side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished possession, and business information is a cherished commodity. For this reason, the courts must, in some cases, keep trade secrets and other business information confidential. 
   But, in my opinion, today's balance of these interests is entirely inadequate. Our legislation will ensure that courts do not carelessly and automatically sanction secrecy when the health and safety of the American public are at stake. At the same time, this bill will allow defendants to obtain secrecy orders when the need for privacy is significant and substantial. 
   Indeed, this proposal would simply codify the practices of the most thoughtful Federal judges. As Justice Breyer has said, ``no court can or should stand silent when they see an immediate, serious risk to.......health or safety.'' Virtually identical legislation received 49 votes on the floor in 1994 and was passed with bipartisan support out of the Judiciary Committee in 1996. 
   Who knows what other hazards are hidden behind courthouse doors? Do we want to wait four decades for the next ``tobacco'' to be disclosed? We need to take action to prevent the next threat before it's too late.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be voting to table S.J. Res. 20, which would authorize the President to use all necessary force against Yugoslavia. 
   On March 23, I voted along with 58 of my colleagues to authorize the use of air strikes against Yugoslavia. I deplore the actions of Slobodan Milosevic, a dictator who has caused pain and suffering for all the peace-loving people of the region. The decision to launch airstrikes was made only after the Administration and NATO worked diligently to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Kosovo. There was, and continues to be, an international consensus that Milosevic's actions demand our continued use of air power. I continue to hope that air strikes will pave the way for an end to hostilities in the region, a return of refugees to Kosovo, and an autonomy arrangement that can be supported by all. The possibility of a diplomatic resolution to this conflict is very much alive. 
   Thus, the resolution before us today is premature. The President has not indicated that he intends to expand the use of force here, he has not indicated any immediate plans to use ground troops, nor has he asked us to fund such an expansion of the conflict in Kosovo. Thus, I must vote to table this resolution.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, more than 2,000 reservists were called up Tuesday to participate in NATO Operation Allied Force. These men and women who may serve for as long as nine months are making a great sacrifice, as are their family members and co-workers who are left behind. 
   It is incumbent upon us to find ways to ease the burden of this service for our reservists, their families and their employers. Two weeks ago the Senate passed tax relief for those serving in Operation Allied Force. The legislation we are introducing today addresses the economic impact of taking reservists away from small businesses, whether the reservist is the owner, a manager or a key employee. 
   The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act allows small businessmen and women to defer loan payments on any direct loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), including disaster loans. The bill directs SBA to come up with a policy for payment deferrals for the microloan program and loans guaranteed under one of SBA's financial assistance programs. Deferrals on loan payments would extend 180 days after the reservist's release from active duty. 
   The bill also establishes a low interest economic injury loan program to provide interim operating capital to any small business experiencing economic harm because a military reservist has been called to active duty. The bill defines economic harm as being unable to provide goods or services that the business usually provides. SBA will administer the loan program through its disaster loan program. 
   Recognizing the disruptions that may occur as a result of the recent call up, the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act directs SBA and its private sector partners to mobilize their resources to offer business counseling and training to inexperienced employees or family members who are left behind to run businesses on their own when a reservist is called up. 
   This legislation is modeled on similar legislation adopted during Operation Desert Storm. It is a practical response to the real and often overlooked impact of calling up military reservists. Wisconsin has some marvelous employers who are tremendously supportive of their employees who serve in the reserves. Several years ago, Schneider Truck of Green Bay, WI, was recognized as the Reserves Employer of the year by the Defense Department. Companies like Schneider do all they can to make it easier for reservists and their families to manage while the service member is on active duty. It is my hope that this legislation will help smaller companies and encourage them to provide reservists and their families with this kind of support. 
   The men and women of the reserves are far more than ``weekend warriors,'' they are the backbone of our military. We are grateful for their willingness to serve. We thank the men and women of the reserves, their families, and their employers for their sacrifices and this service.

    Mr. KOHL. 
   Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DEWINE to introduce the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999. This bipartisan measure will put more criminals behind bars by correcting practical and legal shortcomings that leave too much crucial DNA evidence unused and too many violent crimes unsolved. 
   Currently, all 50 states require DNA samples to be obtained from certain convicted offenders, and these samples increasingly can be shared through a national DNA database established by Federal law. This national database--part of the Combined Database Index System (CODIS)--enables law enforcement officials to link DNA evidence found at a crime scene with any suspect whose DNA is already on file. By identifying repeat offenders, this DNA sharing can and does make a difference. Already the FBI has recorded over 400 matches through DNA databases, helping solve numerous crimes. And in my home state of Wisconsin, experience proves that DNA ``sharing'' pays off. We've already had 19 ``hits'' that have assisted more than 20 criminal investigations. In fact, just a week  before the statute of limitations ran out in a multiple rape investigation, DNA matching helped identify a serial rapist responsible for three rapes in Kenosha and a fourth in Racine. As a result, he's currently serving an 80-year sentence. Without DNA databases, suspects like this otherwise might never be discovered--or convicted. 
   As valuable as this system is, it is not as effective as it could--or should--be. The effectiveness of the database is directly related to the number of DNA profiles it contains. For every 1,000 new profiles, we can expect to find at least one match, and with every new profile added, the odds for a match increase. However, there are currently two major obstacles to the effective functioning of the database. Our measure would correct these problems and make the database far more productive. 
   First, hundreds of thousands of DNA samples that have already been collected still must be analyzed before they can be entered into the national database. The FBI estimates that there is a backlog of nearly 400,000 DNA samples from convicted offenders languishing, unanalyzed, in state crime laboratories for simple lack of funding. 
   Our measure will reduce the backlog of unanalyzed samples by providing the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ``on-line.'' It provides $30 million over two years to erase the backlog of the 400,000 unanalyzed samples and the almost-as-pressing backlog of approximately 200,000 more samples that need to be reanalyzed using state-of-the-art methods. For example, in Wisconsin, we have almost 2,000 samples that have not yet been analyzed, and more than 10,000 that need to be reanalyzed so they can be effectually shared through the national database. 
   Indeed, easing this backlog was the lead recommendation of the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence appointed by the Attorney General. As the Commission explained, ``the power of the CODIS program lies in the sheer numbers of convicted offender samples that are processed and entered into the database.'' 
   Second, for some inexplicable reason, we do not collect samples from Federal and D.C. offenders. So while the database can identify a suspect whose DNA is on 
   file in one of the 50 states, it generally won't catch a Federal or D.C. offender. Under current law, that suspect will not be identified; his crime may not be solved; and he could get off scot-free. We thought we already closed this loophole through 1996 legislation which provides that the FBI ``may expand [the database] to include Federal crimes and crimes committed in the District of Columbia,'' but Federal officials claim more express authority is necessary. We are not so sure they're right, but there is no need to wait any longer. 
   Our measure closes once and for all this loophole that allows DNA samples from Federal (including military) and Washington, D.C. offenders to go uncollected. Under our proposal, DNA samples would be obtained from any Federal offender--or any D.C. offender under Federal custody or supervision--convicted of a violent crime or other qualifying offense. And it would require the collection of samples from juveniles found delinquent under Federal law for conduct that would constitute a violent crime if committed by an adult. Our proposal was prepared with the assistance of the FBI, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Parole Commission, agencies within the District of Columbia responsible for supervision of released felons, and the Department of Defense. 
   Mr. President, modern crime-fighting technology like DNA testing and DNA databases make law enforcement much more effective. But in order to take full advantage of these valuable resources, we need this measure to make the database as comprehensive--and as productive--as possible. Violent criminals should not be able to evade arrest simply because a state didn't analyze its DNA samples or because an inexcusable loophole leaves Federal and D.C. offenders out of the DNA database. This measure will ensure that we apprehend violent repeat offenders, regardless of whether they originally violated state, Federal or D.C. law. And, by collecting more DNA evidence and utilizing the best of DNA technology, we also can help exonerate individual suspects whose DNA does not match with particular crime scenes. 
   The Senate has already made clear that issues like these need to be addressed. In this year's Budget, we acknowledged that ``tremendous backlogs *.*.* prevent swift administration of justice and impede fundamental individual rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and to exculpatory evidence.'' We unanimously concluded that it was the Sense of the Senate that ``Congress should consider legislation that specifically addresses the backlogs in State and local crime laboratories and medical examiner's offices.'' 
   Mr. President, this measure will help police use modern technology to solve crimes and prevent repeat offenders from committing new ones. So we look forward to working with our colleagues and with the Department of Justice to move this measure forward and help law enforcement keep pace with today's criminal.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the direction of our nation's dairy policy. When Congress passed the 1996 Farm Bill, we passed the most significant reform of our agricultural system since the Great Depression. In that bill, we ordered USDA to update our outdated milk pricing laws--something that had not happened for 60 years. 
   In taking these market oriented actions to drag dairy policy into--if not the 21st century--at least the second half of the 20th century, Congress may have spoken more boldly that we were willing to act. Congress has tried to put the brakes on USDA's milk pricing reform efforts from the moment they began. And now, mere days after USDA announced the reformed system, there are those who are seeking to insulate their home states from it by legislating compacts to set the price of milk artificially high in their regions. 
   These actions cannot stand. Though I understand my colleagues desire to protect the dairy farmers in their regions, I cannot let them do so at the expense of the productive dairy farmers in the upper Midwest--or at the expense of a national milk pricing system that, for the first time in sixty years, is market oriented and fair. 
   Expanding the anti-competitive Northeast dairy compact would regionalize the dairy industry and institutionalize market distorting, artificially high prices in one area of the country--just as the rest of the country is moving toward a simplified and more equitable system. 
   Dairy markets are truly national in nature. My region of the country, the Upper Midwest, has learned this lesson all too well. We have seen our competitive dairy industry decline, damaged by the distortion caused by an outmoded milk marketing order system. That system requires that higher prices be paid to producers the farther they are from Wisconsin. Sixty years ago, when the Upper Midwest was the hub of dairy production and the rest of the country lagged far behind, this regional discrimination had some justification. It encouraged the development of a dairy industry capable of producing a local supply of fluid milk in every region. But today, that goal is largely accomplished, and the continuation of the discriminatory pricing policy serves only to fuel the decline of the dairy industry in the Midwest. 
   The new system proposed by USDA is not all that we in the Upper Midwest would want. But it is an improvement in the current system, and a move toward a national compromise on this divisive issue. It is a step forward. 
   The legislation introduced today to continue the Northeast Dairy compact is just the opposite--a step backwards. It would remove a region from the new national dairy pricing system and move toward a Balkanized dairy policy. It hurts consumers in the affected region--consumers who will pay artificially high prices for their milk. And it hurts our hopes of achieving long-overdue unity on dairy pricing reforms that are fair and good for all regions of the country. 
   For all of these reasons, I oppose the expansion of regional milk pricing cartels like the Northeast Compact, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Lets enter the next millennium with a dairy policy that is market-oriented and consumer friendly--not one that ties us to the unjustified protectionism and unnecessary inequities of the past.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my support for the Education Flexibility Partnership Act conference report. I commend the conferees for working so hard to remove the provisions of the bill that would have been harmful to our schools, and for keeping the elements that really will provide much-needed flexibility to States and local school boards to try new, innovative approaches to improving public education. 
   I support this conference report for several reasons. First, it removes the provisions in the Senate bill that would have forced school districts to choose between hiring teachers or serving students with special needs. I strongly support putting more money into IDEA. The Federal government is required to pay for up to 40 percent of special education costs; yet, we are currently only contributing about 10 percent. This is unacceptable and I am committed to increasing the Federal contribution to IDEA. But taking the money away from teachers is not the way to do it. We must find the will and the resources to meet all of our educational needs and responsibilities--we should fund teachers, and special education, and technology, and school construction. We should not force school districts to choose between these important priorities, and I am pleased that the conference report no longer does so. 
   Second, I strongly support the provision in the conference report that allows schools to place disabled children who carry or possess a weapon at school in an alternative education setting. Unfortunately, during consideration of the Senate Ed-flex bill, the amendment that contained this important provision also contained other harmful provisions that would have diverted funding away from teacher. Although I voted against the amendment because of the funding piece, I support this provision to appropriately discipline and remove any student who brings a weapon to school. I am pleased that the harmful pieces of that amendment were dropped in conference, and that this provision to keep guns out of our schools was retained. 
   It seems particularly appropriate, yet tragic, that this requirement should be passed on the day after the school shooting that occurred in  Littleton, Colorado. Although authorities are still sorting through the facts and details of that horrifying incident, one thing is clear: we must aggressively take every step possible to keep guns out of the hands of children and out of our schools. Enactment of my Gun Free School Zones Act was a good start, and this provision continues to move us in the right direction, but I believe we must go further and make the safety of our school children a national, state and local priority. 
   Finally, the Ed-Flex conference takes a small but important first step in correcting a glitch in last year's Class Size Reduction Act. Current law requires that if a school district receives less money than is necessary to hire a teacher, that district must form a consortium with other districts, pool their money together, and share a teacher. This simply won't work in many places in Wisconsin; the teacher would spend more time traveling between school districts than teaching. Yet, under current law, unless the district formed the consortium, they would not have access to the class size money at all. 
   The Conference report partially fixes this problem by allowing those school districts that have already reduced class size in the early grades to access this money without forming a consortium. They are free to use this money for professional development to improve teacher quality. I am pleased by this change, but this does not address the problem for those districts that have not yet reached the target class size reduction goals. These districts want and need this money, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and with the Department of Education to make sure they get it. 
   Mr. President, the Ed-Flex bill does not solve every problem in public education. We still have many issues to address when we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But I support the principle of providing more flexibility to States and local school districts, who have the ultimate responsibility of educating our Nation's children. Although it is a modest step forward, I am pleased to support the Ed-Flex conference report.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Outagamie County Executive James P. Schuette, who is retiring this April after 25 years of service. A lifelong resident of Outagamie  county, Mr. Schuette has shown great commitment to serving the region where he was raised. 
   During his years of public service, Mr. Schuette has been an integral part of many committees that have seen Outagamie county become one of the fastest growing regions in Wisconsin. He has been a member of the Property Committee and witnessed the county's first recycling facility and the purchase and acquisition of land for public parks. While on the legislative committee, he saw region become more politically active on the state level as the area grew and became more prosperous. In the final two years of his career, he attained the venerable position of County Executive. 
   Mr. Schuette is also a patriot. For nine years he served as a sergeant and drill instructor with the United States Marine Corps. After leaving the Marines, he continued his commitment to the armed forces with the United States Army Reserves, serving for 19 years and achieving the rank of Sergeant First Class. 
   James Schuette is an exemplary member of the Outagamie County community and a tribute to his country. We must applaud his dedication and devotion to the community where he grew up as we wish James all the best for his retirement and congratulate him on his many years of service in our State.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Roth amendment. I recognize, as I know all of my colleagues do, that Medicare is facing very serious financial problems. I agree with the proponents of this amendment that Congress must act carefully and expeditiously, in a bipartisan way, to make the structural reforms necessary to preserve Medicare for both current and future seniors. And I want to commend Senator BREAUX and all of the members of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, for working so hard in this effort and creating a starting point for reform. 
   However, at this point, that's what the Breaux plan is--a starting point. I do not necessarily agree with every piece of the Breaux plan, but frankly, it is just too early for the Senate to endorse it. The Commission only finished its work last week, and most of us have not had a chance to study the plan in detail. In addition, the Roth amendment dismisses too quickly the President's proposal to devote 15% of the surplus to Medicare. Even with enactment of structural reforms, it is likely that more money will be needed for Medicare, and we shouldn't have to cut other health and education programs to find it. Even more importantly, in order for Medicare reform to be truly successful, it is essential that we all work cooperatively with one another--and with the President. It is unnecessary to pass an amendment that blasts the President's proposal without giving it full consideration. 
   Mr. President, while I believe we must address Medicare reform, the Budget Resolution is not an appropriate nor meaningful place to do it. The Roth amendment would tie the Senate's hands. It would force us to declare right now that the Breaux plan is the best plan, and that we will not put even a fraction of the surplus into Medicare. I think that would be a mistake. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Roth amendment, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. I would like to take a moment to explain my opposition to the amendment by the gentleman from Idaho, Senator CRAPO. This amendment would set aside all on-budget surpluses above those estimated in the Republican Budget Resolution. These funds would then be used for either tax cuts or debt reduction. While I agree with his goals of reducing taxes and eliminating the debt, I believe that this is the wrong way to go about it. 
   I am committed to reserving 77 percent of the total, unified, surplus to increase the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. I do not believe that we should bind ourselves to the estimates of surpluses in this bill. If higher than anticipated surpluses come into the Treasury then I believe that we should still put 77 percent of those new, unexpected funds into the Social Security and Medicare programs. 
   The Democratic plan leaves 23 percent of the unified surplus for tax cuts, debt reduction and domestic priorities. This leaves room for a tax cut regardless of future surpluses, and is not dependent on the estimates in this bill. Committing ourselves to reserving 77 percent of the unified surplus for Medicare and Social Security will keep these programs solvent longer than the proposal from the Senator for Idaho, and therefore I cannot support his amendment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Kennedy-Dodd amendment. This amendment helps right a wrong that was committed during the Senate Ed-Flex debate several weeks ago. During that debate, the Senate adopted an amendment that effectively forces our school districts to choose between hiring teachers and providing services for students with special needs. This was unfair and unnecessary, and I am still hopeful that the amendment will be dropped in conference. However, I believe we need to do more than that--we need to send a strong signal to our school districts that we are committed to fulfilling our obligations to fully fund both IDEA and hiring teachers. The Kennedy-Dodd amendment does just that. 
   School districts in Wisconsin and across the nation are working hard to improve public education for all children. However, we in Congress must also live up to our obligation to assist them. Although the Federal government has the responsibility to fund 40% of the costs of special education, we are currently only funding about 10%. In addition, school districts will need to hire 2 million new teachers over the next decade, and we should continue to provide funding for them to do that. 
   The Kennedy-Dodd amendment provides full funding for the next six years for both IDEA and the hiring of teachers. This amendment sends a strong message--backed up by real dollars--that we will continue to be partners with local communities in improving education. It tells them we will not tie their hands and force them to choose between hiring teachers and serving students with special needs. It is our duty to live up to our obligations and fully fund both. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Dodd amendment, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a proposal for reducing juvenile crime -- the ``21st Century Safe and Sound Communities Act.'' In the past few years, we have begun to make real advances in fighting youth violence; in fact, in cities across the country, juvenile crime has started to fall. For example, in three ``Weed & Seed'' neighborhoods in Milwaukee, violent felonies dropped 47 percent, gun crimes fell 46 percent, and crime overall was down 21 percent. And after Boston implemented a citywide anti-crime plan, the number of juveniles murdered declined 80 percent, and in more than two years not a single child was killed by a gun. Not one child. Through a program called ``Safe and Sound,'' I have already worked hard with other public officials and business leaders to expand Milwaukee's success citywide. Now we need to build on what works, in order to protect our children and to make as many of our communities across the nation ``safe and sound.'' This measure will be an important step in the right direction. 
   We do not have to reinvent the wheel to reduce juvenile crime. The lesson from Milwaukee, Boston and other cities is clear. There is no single magic solution, but a number of steps, taken together, can and will make a difference: put dangerous criminals behind bars; keep guns out of the hands of juveniles; and create after-school alternatives to gangs and drugs. That's what works, and that's what this proposal is all about. It builds on each of these three basic strategies and expands them to more cities and more rural communities across the nation. Let me explain. 
   First, we can't even begin to stop violent kids unless we have police officers on the street to catch them, and state and local prosecutors to try them. So this proposal makes it easier to lock up dangerous juveniles by extending the highly successful COPS program, which is due to expire after next year, through the year 2004. That will allow us to hire at least 50,000 new community police officers. And it provides $100 million per year for state and local prosecutors to go after juvenile criminals. 
   Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a place to send them. Unfortunately, although we provide states with hundreds of millions of dollars each year to build new prisons, most states use all of these  funds for adult prisons only. So this measure requires states to set aside 10 percent of federal prison funding to juvenile prisons or alternative placements of delinquent children. This commitment is consistent with dedicated funding for juvenile facilities in the Senate-passed 1994 crime bill, which set the stage for spending billions of dollars on prisons through the 1994 Crime Act. 
   This proposal also helps rural communities keep dangerous kids behind bars. Now, although the closest juvenile facility may be hundreds of miles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up violent juveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This means that state law enforcement officials either have to waste the time and resources to criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply let dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. This measure gives rural police the flexibility they need by letting them detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 72 hours, provided they are separated from adult criminals. 
   Moreover, this measure will help lock up gun-toting kids--and the people who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 Youth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by a minor into a felony. And the same goes for 
   anyone who illegally sells handguns to kids. Kids and handguns don't mix, and our Federal law needs to make clear that this is a serious crime. 
   And this measure makes it easier to identify the violent juveniles who need to be dealt with more severely--by strongly encouraging states to share the records of violent juvenile offenders and providing the funding necessary for improved record-keeping. The fact is that law enforcement officials need full disclosure in order to make informed judgments about who should be incarcerated, but current law allows too many records to be concealed or to vanish without a trace when a teen felon turns 18. 
   Second, this proposal will help keep firearms out of the hands of young people. It promotes gun safety by requiring the sale of child safety locks with every new handgun. Child safety locks can help save many of the 500 children and teenagers killed each year in firearms accidents, and the 1,500 kids each year who use guns to commit suicide. Just as importantly, they can help prevent some of the 7,000 violent juvenile crimes committed every year with guns children took from their own homes. 
   It also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we can put them out of business and behind bars. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has been working closely with cities like Milwaukee and Boston to trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using ATF's national database, police and prosecutors can target illegal suppliers of firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our communities. This measure will expand the program to other cities and, with the increased penalties outlined above, help cut down illegal gun trafficking. 
   In addition, it closes an inexcusable loophole that allows violent young offenders to buy guns legally when they turn 18. Under current law, violent adult offenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles can--even the kids convicted of the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, Arkansas--at least once they are released at age 18. This has to stop. So this measure declares that all violent felons are disqualified from buying firearms, regardless of whether they were 10, 12, 14 or just a day short of their 18th birthday at the time of their offense. 
   And not only will this proposal prohibit all violent criminals from owning firearms, no matter what their age, it also encourages aggressive enforcement of this federal law by dedicating federal prosecutors and investigators to this task. This builds on a successful program, supported by the NRA, that has helped reduce gun violence in Richmond through increased federal prosecution, public outreach and fewer plea bargains. 
   Third, a balanced approach also requires a significant investment in crime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. In fact, no one is more adamant in support of this approach than our nation's law enforcement officials. For example, last year more than 400 police chiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors nationwide endorsed a call for after-school programs for all children. And in my home state of Wisconsin, 90 percent of police chiefs and sheriffs I surveyed agreed that we need to increase federal prevention spending. 
   This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in programs that already have a record of success, like Weed & Seed, and those that rely on proven strategies, like the ones that give children a safe place to go in the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when juvenile crime peaks. 
   For example, it expands the Weed & Seed program, a Republican program which 
   combines aggressive enforcement and safe havens for at-risk kids. The measure also gives more schools the resources necessary to stay open after school, through expansion of the 21st Century Learning Center program. It promotes innovative prevention initiatives by reauthorizing and expanding the Title V At-Risk Children Challenge Grant program, which I authored, which encourages investment, collaboration, and long-range prevention planning by local communities, who must establish locally tailored prevention programs and contribute at least 50 cents for every federal dollar. It builds on our support for the valuable work of Boys & Girls Clubs, by continuing to dedicate funding to the Clubs and expanding funding to other successful organizations like the YMCA. And it requires that at least 20 percent of the new juvenile crime funds--namely the recently-appropriated $500 million juvenile accountability block grant--be dedicated to prevention. 
   Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just because they sound good. Quality, not quantity, matters. And it would be foolish to throw good money after bad. That's why my measure cuts nearly $1 billion in prevention programs authorized by the Crime Act--so we don't waste money on redundant programs which don't have records of success or bipartisan support. And that's why my measure requires 5 to 10 percent of all prevention funds to be set aside for rigorous evaluations--so we can keep funding the programs that work, and eliminate the programs that don't. We also reward cities that adopt comprehensive anti-juvenile crime strategies, like Milwaukee's and Boston's--so prevention is part of a balanced, coordinated overall plan.

   Mr. KOHL. Thank you, I say to Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator ASHCROFT. 
   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the budget resolution. This budget is senseless, arrogant, and dishonest. 
   If this were an employee, you would fire him. If this were a house guest, you would boot him. But since this is a budget, our only option is to vote it down--and spend the few hours we have left in this debate hammering out a fiscal plan of which we can be proud. 
   When I call this budget senseless, I mean it literally: The budget does not make sense. The United States is experiencing the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. We are projected to run budget surpluses totaling almost $5 trillion over the next 15 years. 
   In goods times like these, we ought to have the confidence to be bold, to pay our debts from the past, to solve the problems, like runaway entitlement spending, that will plague us in the future, and indeed, to invest wisely in a strong nation. 
   Instead, this budget makes a series of incomprehensible tradeoffs. 
   It increases funding for elementary and secondary education, while removing 100,000 young students from Head Start, and eliminating child care subsidies for 34,000 low-income children. If we follow this budget, we will be ready to teach children who, because we have neglected them in their first 5 years, are not ready to learn. 
   The budget increases spending for research into new diseases, while cutting spending for the vaccines that protect our children from old diseases. 
   The budget increases military spending beyond what the President wants, and cuts diplomatic spending below what the Secretary of State believes is feasible. We are sending the administration out into a world of shifting borders and allegiances armed with a stick too big to lift and a carrot too small to see. 
   The budget fully funds the Violent Crime Trust Fund and cuts 2,700 FBI agents. Now how do we reduce violent crime while also reducing the number of people specifically charged with fighting it? 
   And in perhaps the cruelest mismatch of all, this budget chooses an  enormous tax cut over shoring up the Medicare Trust Fund. The budget trades a long-term policy of health and security, for those who really need it, for a short-term policy of giving cash to those who already have it. 
   These sort of confusing tradeoffs are enough for most of us to reject the budget. But these policy missteps are compounded by the fact that they are continued for many years. 
   The budget includes tax cuts that grow exponentially as far as the eye can see, and 
   huge increases in military hardware purchases in contracts stretched out almost as far. Have we not learned from the past? This is the same combination of defense spending and tax cuts that led to the record budget deficits of the 1980s. Have we no respect for the future? It is the height of arrogance for politicians today to lock future generations into evermore expensive contracts and commitments. 
   And finally, the budget is dishonest. By the admission of several congressional leaders, there is no way the draconian cuts in domestic spending envisioned by this budget will last the year. 
   What that means is, sometime in November, we will all be voting for, and lamenting over, a hastily thrown together omnibus appropriations bill that funds all the needs this budget proposes to ignore. 
   That is a sloppy way to do our business. If these domestic programs are priorities--and I believe they should be--then we ought to discuss them now, plan for them now, budget for them now. It is dishonest to trumpet this budget as responsible spending, while fully expecting to spend irresponsibly and freely at the end of the year. 
   This budget is not evil; it is sloppy. It reflects priorities so misguided and mismatched that no one expects they will be implemented at the end of the day. The budget is not so much a crime as it is a mistake and a missed opportunity. 
   We had a chance to behave responsibly and wisely, using our current surplus and strong economy to underpin a visionary plan for this Nation's fiscal future. We could not have done something for the future, but instead we have a budget that, at best, will get some of us through tonight's 6 o'clock news sound bites. After that, it will be shoved aside for a last minute, unplanned and probably unwise spending spree. 
   So, let's not wait until tomorrow. Let's put this budget out of its misery now. Let's not stumble into the new century with a senseless spending plan. Let's adopt a fiscal framework that makes sense for old and young--that will stand today and in the future. 
   I thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor.

   Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for his remarks and would like to engage him and other Senators in a discussion regarding the purpose of the Senator's amendment and the overall policy considerations attached to it. When Congress enacted farm disaster legislation last Fall, we recognized the dire circumstances of farmers from both natural and economic conditions. Not only did that legislation recognize the problems farmers faced in 1998, but it also dealt with problems farmers have had over the past several years. From a policy perspective, it is well recognized that a sound, reliable risk management program, which includes crop insurance, needs to be established to avoid the inherently unfair and unpredictable ad hoc disaster programs of years past. 
   The amendment by the Senator from Alabama recognizes that crop insurance is available to farmers through both federally reinsured policies and policies based solely by private companies. His amendment modifies language included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill regarding the requirement that the Secretary not discriminate or penalize producers who have taken out crop insurance by stating the requirement applies to both federally reinsured policies and those offered solely by private companies. We all recognize the difficult times facing farmers and we want to see all farmers treated fairly and equally. 
   It is equally important that we do not take steps that inadvertently undermine our overall objectives for both long-term farm policy and immediate administration of the pending disaster payments. In accepting the amendment by the Senator from Alabama, we hope to continue a dialogue with him and other Senators as we approach conference to ensure the amendment is in the best interest of farmers.

   Mr. KOHL. I agree with the remarks by my friend from Iowa and I would like to further note that farmers in Wisconsin are equally in need of assistance immediately. As we approach conference, I hope to stay in close contact with all interested Senators to ensure that nothing is done to overwhelm the Department's administration of the disaster program by imposing a new series of control and verification requirements. We want to be responsive to all Senators' interests, but we know farmers are looking for a responsive, and timely disaster program. As some have noted, many farmers believe we are past the period of a proper and timely response.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, for the past two years, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Office of Legislative Affairs has been under the able leadership of Steven J. Pirotte. Special Agent Pirotte has served as the Executive Assistant to the Director of ATF since the beginning of 1997, and in that capacity, has provided conscientious service to many Members of Congress and their staffs, my own included. 
   Steve is moving to a new challenge on April 18, when he reports to his new post of duty as the Division Director and Special Agent in Charge of ATF's Boston Field Division, with oversight over ATF's functions in Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Northern New York and New Hampshire. His honest counsel, assistance, and expertise will be missed by all of us who have worked with him. 
   Special Agent Pirotte began his career with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1975 in Falls Church, Virginia, later serving posts of duty in Washington, D.C., Winchester, Virginia, and Denver, Colorado. From 1986 to 1989, he served as Group Supervisor for the Mid-Atlantic Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and coordinated all OCDETF investigations in the two field divisions and 26 offices throughout the Mid-Atlantic states, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. 
   He served three years on ATF's National Response Team, served as supervisor with the Metropolitan Area Task Force for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and just prior to his current assignment, served as Assistant Special Agent in Charge of ATF's Charlotte, North Carolina Field Division, overseeing bombing, church arson, firearms trafficking and cigarette diversion investigations. 
   Members of Congress have been well served with Steve at the helm of ATF's Legislative Affairs office, and we wish him well in his new position.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today, along with Senators HARKIN and DURBIN, I introduce an amendment to add $28 million this fiscal year to the Conservation Reserve Program CRP, run  by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS of USDA. The amendment is fully offset and acceptable to Senator COCHRAN and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   One of the benefits of my job is having an opportunity to travel many of the highways and backroads of the State of Wisconsin. And, I like so many other residents of my State, never tire of the landscape of rolling hills, grazing dairy cows, and handsome farms. In the last few years, dotted among these lovely farms, is a new sight--or, perhaps more accurately, a sight so old that not many of us have had a chance to experience it. There are patches of land where the native trees, grasses and flowers are growing again; where white tail deer and pheasant walk among wood violets and sugar maples the way they did 150 years ago. These pieces of land, restored to their original natural beauty, are living museums--reminders to ourselves and our children of the magnificence of Wisconsin's native landscape. 
   Much of this land restoration is due to the Conservation Reserve Program, a federal program that, in effect, rents land from farmers and restores it to its natural state. Wisconsin farmers have enthusiastically embraced this effort enrolling 72,000 acres of land in the CRP this year along. Altogether, the CRP has restored 600,000 acres of land in Wisconsin. 
   Despite this program's great success--in Wisconsin and rural areas across the country--a provision of the 1996 farm bill has inadvertently put the CRP in jeopardy. Section 11 of the farm bill capped the administrative costs that the USDA can pay out on any program. The provision was an attempt to slow some over-enthusiastic compute purchasing at the USDA. Unfortunately, it also capped the technical assistance allowed under the CRP in a way that will make it illegal for the CRP to identify or enroll new acres after May of this year. Our amendment today, by adding $28 million for these necessary administrative functions, will allow the CRP to continue its work. 
   Our offset today is from the food stamp reserve fund, and I want to say a word about that. Every year, we put aside more money than we anticipate we will need to cover our food stamps obligations. We do so in order to make sure that that very vital anti-hunger program is available even if demand increases because of an unexpected economic downturn. As the year progresses without such a downturn, it is appropriate and responsible budgeting to move some of those funds, which will not be needed, into areas where there is pressing needs. 
   That said, we still must keep a reasonable balance in reserve for food stamps, and in no way should this fund be viewed by others with amendments as a piggy bank. 
   The CRP is an example of an environmental program that successfully marries the interests of farmers, conservationists, and nature lovers. It is voluntary, it is local in direction, it is effective. I am glad we were able to agree to keep such a worthy program alive this year, and I thank my colleagues who have helped clear this amendment.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, none of us who sit here in the Senate today is unaware of the potential dangers that face this country from rogue nations with ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction. There are many nations around the world that are eagerly pursuing weapons that can reach the United States and deliver devastating damage. I, like many of my colleagues, was stunned when I heard the news that North Korea had launched a three stage rocket with technology that many in the intelligence community had said the North Koreans would not possess for many years. All this evidence leads me to agree with Secretary Cohen when he says that the threat to the United States is ``real and growing.'' Because of the danger we face, and our solemn vow to protect this nation, I will vote to support Senator COCHRAN's bill, S. 257, to deploy a missile defense as soon as technologically possible. 
   With threats looming on the horizon it would be irresponsible not to pursue the development and deployment of a national missile defense. The Administration has responded to the threat by expanding the program. The President has increased funding by $6 billion over five years. They will make a decision next year whether an effective national missile defense can be deployed by 2005.  Negotiations with the Russians have already begun in an effort to reach agreement on amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The President has now reversed his previous opposition to this bill by withdrawing his veto threat. The United States is moving forward on missile defense, and this legislation will add momentum. 
   However, I do have reservations about this bill. A national missile defense system is not a sure thing. Currently there is no technology capable of destroying an ICBM, and we don't know when the technology will be developed. But we do know that developing this technology will be costly. To date we have spent almost sixty-seven billion dollars on developing missile defenses since the early 1980's without anything to show for it. I am concerned that by making a decision to build a system as soon as technologically possible the Congress may commit itself to an expensive project that the General Accounting Office has deemed ``high risk.'' The Pentagon is infamous for underestimating the cost of weapons systems. Right now the Administration plans on spending ten billion dollars over six years on NMD, but I expect that as the project moves forward the cost will rise. We must be careful not to let our commitment to missile defense blind us from our duty to oversee this program and guard against waste and profligate spending so common in the Department of Defense. 
   While I am very concerned about the costs of the program and the impact on our relations with Russia, I believe we should build a national missile defense to protect our nation in this dangerous and uncertain time. The United States should move swiftly, but with prudence, to safeguard our citizens from the threats of rogue nations and the fear of accidental launches.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my intention to vote for final passage of the Education Flexibility Act. Although this bill is far from perfect, I support the underlying principle of flexibility in education, and believe we should move this bill forward. 
   Despite my support for giving local school districts more flexibility in improving education, I have serious concerns about this bill. Last year, we passed a new initiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. We approved this program on a bipartisan basis, recognizing that research has shown that smaller classes give teachers more time to spend with individual students and improves student achievement. 
   School districts in Wisconsin are already putting together their budgets and planning to use this Federal money to hire teachers. They are looking to Congress to send them assurances that the teachers they hire today will receive Federal support over the next six years. I am extremely disappointed that the Senate failed to adopt Senator MURRAY's class size amendment, which would authorized the program for six years and given our school districts that assurance. I am hopeful that we can still address this important issue later this year. 
   In addition to the Senate's failure to authorize the class size initiative, I am also concerned that the bill, as amended, pits students with special needs against other students in fighting for education funding. This is inexcusable--and unnecessary. 
   I agree that the Federal government must live up to its obligation to pay for 40% of the costs of special education. It is a responsibility we have failed to meet for far too long, and I will continue to fight for full funding of special education. However, I believe it is time that we make education of all our children--including those with special needs--our top priority. There is no reason why we cannot fully fund all of our educational needs in this country. We should fully fund special education, and we should fully fund class size, and after-school programs, and school construction. We can do all of these things--and we should not pit any of these vital programs against one another as some have tried to do here today. 
   I am extremely concerned about the amendments that were added to this bill today. Although I recognize that school districts need additional resources for special education, I believe these amendments wrongly force them to choose between special education and hiring teachers--another essential need they face. We should not force them to make this choice--we should provide enough funding to fill both needs. 
   Although I am deeply troubled about these amendments, I will vote for final passage of the bill because I believe in the original intent of providing more flexibility to States and local school districts. I am voting for it now because I think we need to move this bill forward. However, I strongly believe these amendments should be dropped in conference. If this bill comes back from the Conference Committee with these amendments still included, I will be forced to oppose the bill. 
   Mr. President, I still hold out hope that these problems can be worked out in conference, and that we can move  this bill, which was originally a bipartisan bill, forward expeditiously.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator SESSIONS, to introduce the bipartisan Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act of 1999, legislation which addresses a serious problem that threatens Americans' confidence in our bankruptcy laws. The measure would cap at $100,000 the State homestead exemption that an individual filing for personal bankruptcy can claim. It passed the Senate last year when it was included in the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998 (H.R. 3150), and I hope that we can all support this measure again this year. The goal of our measure is simple but vitally important: to make sure that our Bankruptcy Code is more than just a beachball for crooked millionaires who want to hide their assets. 
   Let me tell you why this legislation is critically needed. In chapter 7 Federal personal bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is allowed to exempt certain possessions and interests from being used to satisfy his outstanding debts. One of the chief things that a debtor seeks to protect is his home, and I agree with that in principle. Few question that debtors should be able to keep a roof over their heads. But, in practice, this homestead exemption has become a source of great abuse. 
   Under section 522 of the Code, a debtor may opt to exempt his home according to local, State, or Federal bankruptcy provisions. The Federal exemption allows the debtor to shield up to $15,000 of value in his house. The State exemptions vary tremendously: some States do not allow the debtor to exempt any of his home's value, while a handful of states set no ceiling and allow an unlimited exemption. The vast majority of states have exemptions under $40,000. 
   Our proposal would amend Section 522 to cap State exemptions so that no debtor could ever exempt more than $100,000 of the value of his home. 
   Mr. President, in the past few years, the ability of debtors to use State homestead exemptions has led to flagrant abuses of the Bankruptcy Code. Multimillionaire debtors have moved to one of the states with unlimited exemptions--most often Florida or Texas--bought multi-million-dollar houses, and continued to live like kings even after declaring bankruptcy. This shameless manipulation of the Bankruptcy Code cheats honest creditors out of compensation and rewards only those who can ``game'' the system. Oftentimes, the creditor who is robbed is the American taxpayer. In recent years, S&L swindlers, convicted insider trader convicts, and others have managed to protect their ill-gotten gains through this loophole. 
   The owner of a failed Ohio S&L, who was convicted of securities fraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still held on to the multimillion dollar ranch he bought in Florida. A convicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least $50 million in debts and fines, but still kept his $5 million Florida mansion with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. And just last year, movie star Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt through bankruptcy, but still held onto his $2.5 million Florida estate. These deadbeats stay wealthy while legitimate creditors--including the U.S. Government--get the short end of the stick. 
   Simply put, the current practice is grossly unfair and contravenes the intent of our laws: People are supposed to get a fresh start, not a head start, under the Bankruptcy Code. 
   Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced today is simple, effective and straightforward. It caps the homestead exemption at $100,000, which is far more than estimated median home equity of people in bankruptcy. It is endorsed by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. And it will protect middle class Americans while preventing the abuses that are making the middle class question the integrity of our laws--the abuses the average American taxpayer is paying for out of pocket. 
   Indeed, it is even generous to debtors. Less than ten states have a homestead exemption that exceeds $100,000. More than two-thirds of states cap the exemption at $40,000 or less. My own home state of Wisconsin has a $40,000 exemption and that, in my opinion, is more than sufficient. 
   Mr. President, this proposal is an effort to make our bankruptcy laws more equitable. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator FEINGOLD to introduce the ``Dairy Promotion Fairness Act.'' This measure will further our nation's dairy marketing board's efforts to promote the consumption of healthy dairy products produced by family dairy farms and to fund research critical to the development of new dairy products. 
   This effort is needed as a matter of fairness to our nation's dairy farmers. When enacted, our legislation will require that all dairy producers whose products are sold in the United States contribute to the promotional effort. Currently, domestic producers of dairy products like cheese, butter, and yogurt, all pay a promotional fee to help promote the dairy products produced in this country. Importers do not pay this fee.  
   I was extremely surprised to find out that dairy producers can import these goods into the United States and not contribute to the promotional sales efforts sponsored by our domestic industry. This change will require those selling incoming products to contribute the same assessment as the domestic dairy farmers do.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the ``Antitrust Merger Review Act'' (S. 467), a bill that I introduced with Senator DEWINE, my colleague on the Antitrust Subcommittee. This measure sets a deadline on the Federal Communications Commission when it reviews mergers. In other words, our bill says to the FCC: approve a merger, reject it, or apply conditions. But don't sit on it. 
   All too often, telecommunication companies, their customers, and their employees are left to mercy of a time-consuming merger review process--a process in which the two lead agencies, the Department of Justice and the FCC, act in sequence rather than in tandem. Like the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, who have deadlines under the Hart-Scott-Rodino laws, there is no compelling reason to let the FCC ``hang back'' and wait until the end. 
   Our bill is simple, effective and straightforward, and sets reasonable time limits for the FCC to follow. When a license transfer application is filed, the FCC will have 30 days to decide whether or not a ``second request'' for further information is needed from the merging companies. If this second request phase is needed, the FCC will then have six months after receiving the additional material--so-called ``substantial compliance''--to make a determination. For those familiar with antitrust laws, these time limits are nothing new or shocking. If anything, they make common sense by creating a framework for a timely decision. And this measure is entirely consistent with the thrust of the 1996 Telecom Act, which strengthened the hand of the antitrust laws in addressing telecom mergers. See, e.g., Public Law 104-104 &#167;601(b). 
   But Mr. President, let me also tell you what this bill is not. First, while our measure sets time limits on the FCC's merger review process, it does not change the FCC's substantive role in approving or rejecting these deals. Others have suggested doing this, but many of us believe that the FCC through application of its ``public interest test'' can obtain market-opening concessions from merging companies that the DOJ, under antitrust laws, simply cannot. Second, though some in Congress may want to revisit other aspects of the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust laws, this bill is not a vehicle for substantive changes--they are best left for other measures at another time. 
   This is not a perfect piece of legislation to be sure, but it is a step in the right direction. Still, it is a work in progress, so we plan to work together with our colleagues, Senator HOLLINGS and Senator MCCAIN, and to get input from all the affected parties. After that, we will ask for our colleagues' support for this bipartisan proposal, which will help companies get on with their businesses, and employees and consumers get on with their lives.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. Chief Justice, throughout this process my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have conducted themselves with decency and dignity, exactly the qualities President Clinton's conduct lacked. But we risk opening the floodgates to more party-line impeachments if we oust a President from office for behavior that--while truly deplorable--isn't truly removable. Lowering the standard would do as great a disservice to the Constitution as the President's behavior has done to the Oval Office. So I am voting to acquit on both articles. 
   I state these conclusions with a certainty I do not feel. We have heard many say these votes are the most difficult they will ever cast, and I agree. This case is made up of many small questions, matters of opinion and fact: Did the President lie? Did he commit perjury? Did he obstruct justice? Did he weaken the judicial system? Did he undermine the Constitution? Are these ``high'' crimes? Is this what the Founders envisioned when they talked about removal of a President? 
   Most of us have answers for each of these questions. Most of us will lay them out in well-worded, well-argued statements. But the sum of the answers is not the sum of this case. The sum of our opinions, our findings of fact, and our legal briefs cannot sum up the deep disquiet I feel about the failings, lies, and weakness displayed by the President. Under the cold body of evidence before us runs the bad blood of bad character, and that deeply disturbs me. 
   The evidence does not prove high crimes, but it does prove low character in our highest office--and that matters, it is relevant, it is material. This nation is not defined merely by demographics, boundaries, geological features, and government regulations; it is also about families and individuals who struggle to be larger, braver, and stronger than their circumstances. It is a nation that has a history of putting lives, faith, and hope in causes bigger than any one person: justice, democracy, freedom. Similarly, the office of  the Presidency is not just a set of protocols, formalities, and policies. It is the human face we put on our country, and that face ought to be as honest, just, strong and brave as we all aspire to be--and as our history demands that we be. 
   That's why character matters. I cannot find a way to fit my concern for that spirit into these very formal, legal proceedings, but I also cannot, in good conscience, let go of my deep concern for the harm and the loss this President has caused. I will not vote for either article of impeachment, but I also will not let go of my firm belief that this President has done real damage to the Office of the Presidency. And I will not let go of a commitment to do everything I can to restore and protect the idea that good character is essential in those who ask to serve and represent this country. 
   Let me explain in more detail why I am voting against both articles. First, removing a President is a drastic measure, called for in only the most extraordinary circumstances. And our Founding Fathers clearly wanted it to be used sparingly: that's why they limited impeachment to only ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' involving abuse of power, incapacity to hold office, or a serious threat to our Constitution or system of government. 
   But the President's conduct, however reprehensible, related to purely personal matters. He lied to the American people. He lied to his family, his friends and his staff. He lied under oath and evidence suggests that he may have obstructed justice. Simply put, his conduct was disgraceful and, possibly, illegal. 
   However, his actions did not relate to abuse of power. They had nothing to do with his official acts or his capacity to hold office. They did not threaten our Constitution or system of government. Though serious offenses to our American values and decency, they do not rise to the level of constitutional ``high" crimes. 
   Some of my colleagues have a different view, and I respect their position. But even the House prosecutors respect mine. In response to one of my questions, House Manager GRAHAM acknowledged that ``reasonable people can disagree'' about whether the President should be removed. In fact, he went on to say: 
   ``[I]f I was sitting where you're at, I would probably get down on my knees before I made that decision, because the impact on society is going to be real either way. And if you find the President guilty in your mind from the facts, that's he a perjurer and he obstructed justice, you've got to somehow reconcile continued service in light of that event. And I think it's important for this body not to have a disposition plan that doesn't take in consideration the good of this nation. . . . [Y]ou've got to consider what's best for this nation.'' 
   Representative GRAHAM deserves credit for putting candor above partisanship, and inviting us to decide ``what's best for this nation.'' To do that, it makes sense to consider the views of the American people. Most of them know what this case is about and most of them oppose this impeachment. Nothing we've heard clearly justifies rejecting the overwhelming weight of their opinion and removing a twice-elected President. 
   Indeed, if ``reasonable people can disagree,'' as the House prosecutors concede, have we really met the high threshold established for removal? 
   To ask that question is to answer it. 
   It is true, of course, that we have removed judges for lying under oath; for example, ten years ago the Senate removed Judge Nixon on that basis. But impeaching the President, our highest elected official, is far different. Judge Nixon was appointed. He held office during ``good Behaviour.'' At the time of his Senate trial, he was already convicted and sitting in jail. He lied about bribery, not sex. And most importantly, the only way a judge can be removed is by impeachment. A President, on the other hand, can be removed every four years through an election, and is automatically removed after eight years by the 22nd Amendment. 
   Second, in addition to the constitutional problems, the prosecution has not proved its allegations by clear and convincing evidence. This is especially true on the ``obstruction of justice'' charge, which is by far the more serious allegation. The House Managers argue that more witnesses would have made a difference in bolstering their case, and they may be right. But why then did the House choose not to call witnesses in its own proceedings, even though it had called ``fact'' witnesses in nearly every other impeachment? 
   Third, as many of us told the House in the Judge Nixon impeachment trial, lumping together a series of charges in each article--at least four perjury charges and seven obstruction of justice charges here--isn't fair or responsible. Alarmingly, the President could be found guilty without a two-thirds majority believing any single charge. For example, in theory, even if each obstruction charge were rejected by a 90 to 10 margin, the President could be convicted--because ten different Senators convicting on each of seven separate charges adds up to 70--more than a two-thirds majority. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, this kind of ``one from column A and two from column B'' approach may work for a Chinese restaurant, but not for removing a President--or a judge. And this lack of specificity shortchanges the American people, who may never understand which charges were believed and which ones weren't. 
   Still, President Clinton is not ``above the law.'' His conduct should not be excused, nor will it. The President can be criminally prosecuted, especially once he leaves office. In other words, his acts may not be ``removable'' wrongs, but they could be ``convictable'' crimes. Moreover, the House vote of impeachment--and the President's misconduct with Monica Lewinsky--will forever scar this President's legacy. Finally, the Senate can and should censure the President, and we ought make our condemnation of his conduct as strong as possible. 
   In sum, Mr. Chief Justice, President Clinton's conduct was wrong, reckless and indefensible. Under the Constitution it does not justify removal. But for those who love this country, it demands outrage and disappointment. It demands a commitment from this President and future Presidents, this Congress and future Congresses--not now, and not ever again, to let personal weakness and personal failing stain or shake our democracy. Thank you.

    Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, during the impeachment trial, it was the duty of the Senate to look at the facts, look at the law, look at the Constitution, and make a judgment. We did our duty. 
   But now we need to go one step further because neither acquittal nor conviction is an entirely adequate conclusion to this sordid matter. We must speak our contempt and disappointment for the low behavior of our highest elected official. 
   We need to speak for the spirit behind our laws, behind this institution, behind the country. We need to say that the President's actions and lies were wrong--``shameful, reckless and indefensible.'' We need to acknowledge that his conduct, unacceptable for any American, is especially so for the President of the United States because it ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.'' 
   I am proud that all 100 Senators worked together through this ordeal to do our duty. I am proud that so many of us from both sides of the aisle worked together to craft this tough censure resolution. 
   But I am sorry that a small minority will keep us from also doing what is honorable and what is right. We need to officially express our collective disdain for the President's conduct. It's the only truly appropriate, bipartisan way to bring closure to this melancholy moment in American history. 
   When Senator FEINSTEIN and I started talking about a censure resolution, as early as last December, I had no certainty that we would come so far and bring so many along. Her perseverance, hard work and legislative craftsmanship deserve our praise, but our efforts deserve a clean ``up or down'' vote.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator GRASSLEY and I today introduce the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999. This legislation addresses growing problems in class action litigation, particularly unfair and abusive settlements that shortchange class members while class lawyers line their pockets with high fees. 
   Let me share with you just a few disturbing examples. 
   First, one of my constituents, Martha Preston of Baraboo, Wisconsin, was an unnamed member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company that ended in a settlement. While at first she got $4 and change in compensation, a few months later her lawyers surreptitiously took $80--twenty times her compensation--from her escrow account to pay their fees. In total, her lawyers managed to pocket over $8 million in fees, but never explained that the class--not the defendant--would pay the attorneys' fees. Naturally outraged, she and others sued the class lawyers. Her lawyers turned around and sued her in Alabama--a state she had never visited--and demanded an unbelievable $25 million. So not only did she lose $75, she was forced to defend herself from a $25 million lawsuit. 
   Second, class lawyers and defendants often engineer settlements that leave plaintiffs with small discounts or coupons unlikely ever to be used. Meanwhile, class lawyers reap big fees based on unduly optimistic valuations. For example, in a settlement of a class action against major airlines, most plaintiffs received less than $80 in coupons while class attorneys received $14 million in fees based on a projection that the discounts were worth hundreds of millions. In a suit over faulty computer monitors, class members got $13 coupons, while class lawyers pocketed $6 million. And in a class action against Nintendo, plaintiffs received $5 coupons, while attorneys took almost $2 million in fees. 
   Third, competing federal and state class actions engage in a race to settlement, where the best interests of the class lose out. For example, in one state class action the class lawyers negotiated a small settlement precluding  all other suits, and even agreed to settle federal claims that were not at issue in state court. Meanwhile, a federal court found that the federal claims could have been worth more than $1 billion, while accusing the state class lawyers of ``hostile representation'' that ``surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of subversion'' and pursuit of self-interest in ``getting a fee'' that was ``more in line with the interests of [defendants] than those of their clients.'' 
   Fourth, class actions are often filed in state courts that are more likely to give inadequate consideration to class certification and class settlements. On several occasions, a state court has certified a class action although federal courts rejected certification of the same case. And in several Alabama state courts, 38 out of 43 classes certified in a three-year period were certified on an ex parte basis, without notice and hearing. One Alabama judge acting ex parte certified 11 class actions in 1997 alone. Comparably, only an estimated 38 class actions were certified in federal court that year (excluding suits against the U.S. and suits brought under federal law). This lack of close scrutiny appears to create a big incentive to file in state court, especially given the recent findings of a Rand study that class actions are increasingly concentrated in state courts. 
   Fifth, in nationwide class actions filed in state court, class lawyers often manipulate the pleadings to avoid removal to federal court, even by minimizing the potential claims of class members. For example, state class actions often seek just over $74,000 in damages per plaintiff, and forsake punitive damage claims, to avoid the $75,000 floor that qualifies for federal diversity jurisdiction. Or they defeat the federal requirement of complete diversity by naming one class member who is from the same state as a defendant, even if all other class members are from different states. 
   Finally, out-of-state defendants are often hauled into state court to address nationwide class claims, although federal courts are a more appropriate and more efficient forum. For example, an Alabama court is now considering a class action--and could establish a national policy--in a suit brought against the big three automakers on behalf of every American who bought a dual-equipped air bags over an eight-year period. The defendants failed in their attempt to remove to federal court based on an application of current diversity laws. And, unlike federal courts, states are unable to consolidate multiple class actions that involve the same underlying facts. 
   These examples show that abuse of the class action system is not only possible, but real. And the incentives and realities of the current system are a big part of the problem. 
   A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents an individual plaintiff, but, in addition, seeks relief for all those individuals who suffered a similar injury. Prospective class members are usually sent notice about the class action, and are presumed to join it, unless they specifically ask to be left out. When these suits are settled, all class members are notified of the terms of the settlement and given the chance to object if they don't think the settlement is fair. A court must ultimately approve a settlement agreement. 
   The vast majority of these suits are brought and settled fairly and in good faith. Unfortunately, the class action system does not adequately protect class members from the few unscrupulous lawyers who are more interested in big attorneys' fees than compensation for their clients, the victims. The primary problem is that the client in a class action is a diffuse group of thousands of individuals scattered across the country, which is incapable of exercising meaningful control over the litigation. As a result, while in theory the class lawyers must be responsive to their clients, the lawyers control all aspects of the litigation. 
   Moreover, during a class action settlement, the amount of the attorney fee is negotiated between plaintiffs' lawyers and the defendants, just like other terms of the settlement. But in most cases the fees come at the expense of class members--the only party that does not have a seat at the bargaining table. 
   In addition, defendants may use class action settlements to advance their own interests. Paying a small settlement generally precludes all future claims by class members. So defendants have ample motivation to give class lawyers the fees they want as the price for settling all future liabilities. 
   As a result, it is easy to see how class members are left out in the cold. Although the judge is supposed to determine whether the settlement is fair before approving it, class lawyers and defendants ``may even put one over on the court, a staged performance. The lawyers support the settlement to get fees; the defendants support it to evade liability; the court can't vindicate the class's rights because the friendly presentation means that it lacks essential information,'' Kamilewicz v. Bank of Boston Corp., 100 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (7th Cir. 1996). 
   Although class members get settlement notices and have the opportunity to object, they rarely do so, especially if they have little at stake. Not only is it expensive to get representation, but also it can be extremely difficult to actually understand what the settlement really does. Settlements are often written in long, finely printed letters with incomprehensible legalese, 
   which even well-trained attorneys are hard pressed to understand. And settlements often omit basic information like how much money will go toward attorneys' fees and where that money will come from. In Martha Preston's case, one prominent federal judge found that ``the notice not only didn't alert the absent class members to the pending loss but also pulled the wool over the state judge's eyes,'' id. 
   We all know that class actions can result in significant and important benefits for class members and society, and that most class lawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions have been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain redress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate individuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class actions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable people to pursuant claims collectively that would otherwise be too expensive to litigate. 
   The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is weeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we propose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file or settle a class action. It seeks to address the problem in several ways. First, it requires that State attorneys general be notified about proposed class action settlements that would affect residents of their states. With notice, the attorneys general can intervene in cases where they think the settlements are unfair. 
   Second, the legislation requires that class members be notified of a potential settlement in clear, easily understood English--not legal jargon. 
   Third, it limits class attorneys' fees to a reasonable percentage of the actual damages received by plaintiffs or to reasonable hourly fees. This will deter class lawyers from using inflated values of coupon settlements to reap big fees. Some courts have already embraced this standard, which parallels the recent securities reform law. 
   Fourth, it permits removal to federal court of certain class actions involving citizens of multiple states, at the request of unnamed class members or defendants. This provision eliminates gaming by class lawyers to keep cases in state court and, through consolidation of related cases in federal court, helps prevent a race to settlement between competing class actions. 
   Finally, it amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures to require the imposition of sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits, although the nature and extent of sanctions remains discretionary. This provision will deter the filing of frivolous class actions. 
   Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not close the courthouse door to any class action. We do not require that State attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do not deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that every class action be brought in federal court. Instead, we simply promote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class settlements.  
   These proposals have earned a broad range of support. Even Judge Paul Niemeyer, the Chair of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, who has studied class actions closely and testified before Congress on this issue, expressed his support for this ``modest'' measure, noting in particular that increasing federal jurisdiction over class actions will be a positive ``meaningful step.'' Last year, our bill passed the Judiciary Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee. 
   Mr. President, right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits unaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our bill does is give regular people back their rights and representation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves use forward. It will help ensure that good people like Martha Preston don't get ripped off. 
   Mr. President, Senator GRASSLEY and I believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of class actions. It is both pro-consumer and pro-defendant. We believe it will make a difference.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator GRASSLEY as a cosponsor of ``Safeguarding America's Farms Entering the Year 2000.'' This measure would make permanent the bankruptcy code provisions that protect family farmers in hard times by giving them the ability to hold on to their farms while they reorganize their finances. 
   Without prompt action by Congress, the bankruptcy laws for family farmers, known as Chapter 12, will expire on April 1, 1999. When Congress first enacted Chapter 12 in 1986 for seven years, we intended to make Chapter 12 permanent if it proved successful. Already, Chapter 12 has been extended twice, in 1993 and again last year. 
   Family farmers need this permanent protection because Chapter 12 works. It takes into consideration the unique circumstances faced by family farmers. It recognizes our special interest in keeping family farms in the family, where possible. And in practice it pays off--according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, farmers in Chapter 12 are more likely to successfully reorganize than individuals filing under parallel chapters.  
   The continued success of the tens of thousands of family farmers in Wisconsin--and millions nationwide--is important to our national interest. But their well-being is too often jeopardized by elements out of their control. For example, many Wisconsin farmers now are facing distress due to unusually low prices for hogs, corn and soy beans. The opportunity to reorganize their business under Chapter 12 may be an important option in these difficult times. They deserve to know that this protection will always be available. Thank you.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Farm Retirement Equity Act, a bill to help improve the retirement security of our nation's farmers. 
   As we begin the 106th Congress, we can anticipate legislative action to strengthen retirement security and to boost individual savings on behalf of all Americans. With good reason, these issues have risen to the top of the nation's agenda. Americans are living longer and changing jobs more often. Medical costs are rising and demogarphic trends are undermining the long-term viability of our social security system. Comprehensive planning for the many years Americans are often able to enjoy in retirement is now more important than ever. 
   We took some steps to address retirement security in the 105th Congress, but the job is far from accomplished. We must be vigilant in acting to reform social security on behalf of all Americans and in addressing the unique retirement needs of individual groups of Americans. The legislation I introduce today attempts to act on behalf of one such group, a group at the heart of our American traditions, the family farmer. 
   As many of my colleagues know, farming is a highly capital-intensive business. To the extent that the average farmer reaps any profits from his or her farming operation, much of that income is directly reinvested into the farm. Rarely are there opportunities for farmers to put money aside in individual retirement accounts. In addition, as self-employed business people, farmers do not have access to the pension or retirement funds that many Americans enjoy. When the time comes, farmers tend to rely on the sale of their accumulated capital assets, such as real estate, livestock, and machinery, in order to provide the income to sustain them during retirement. However, all too often, farmers are finding that the lump-sum payments of capital gains taxes levied on those assets leave little for retirement. 
   To alleviate this predicament, my legislation would provide retiring farmers the opportunity to rollover the proceeds from the sale of their farms into a tax-deferred retirement account. Instead of paying a large lump-sum capital gains tax at the point of sale, the income from the sale of a farm would be taxed only as it is withdrawn from the retirement account. Such a change in method of taxation would help prevent the financial distress that many farmers now face upon retirement. 
   Second, my legislation would address the diminishing interest of our younger rural citizens in continuing in farming. Because this legislation will facilitate the transition of our older farmers into a successful retirement, the Family Farm Retirement Equity Act will also pave the way for a more graceful transition of our younger farmers toward farm ownership. While low prices and low profits in farming will continue to take their toll on our younger farmers, I believe that my proposal will be one tool we can use to make farming more viable for the next generation. 
   In past Congresses, this proposal has enjoyed the support of farmers and farm organizations throughout the country and the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Sheep Industry Association, the American Sugar Beet Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cattleman's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Producers Council, and the Southwester Peanut Growers Association. In addition, a modified version of this legislation was included in the Targeted Investment Incentive and Economic Growth Act of 1997, as introduced by Minority Leader DASCHLE and other Senators. I look forward to working with these groups and my colleagues again this Congress to act on this important legislation as swiftly as possible. 
   In addition, I am introducing the Child Care Infrastructure Act, a bill to provide a tax credit for businesses that create child care opportunities for their employees. While I will have much more to say about this important legislation at a later date, I did want to put it in the hopper today. Providing quality child care is and should be at the center of our agenda for the 106th Congress. My proposal is a low-cost approach to address this issue by involving the private sector and has received praise from businesses, parents, and day care workers alike.

   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Child Safety Lock Act of 1999, along with Senators CHAFEE, FEINSTEIN, BOXER and DURBIN. Our bipartisan measure will save children's lives by reducing the senseless tragedies that result when improperly stored and unlocked handguns come within the reach of children. 
   Each year, nearly 500 children and teenagers are killed in firearms accidents, and every year 1,500 more children use firearms to commit suicide. Additionally, about 7,000 violent juvenile crimes are committed annually with guns which children take from their own homes. Safety locks can be effective in preventing at least some of these incidents. 
   The sad truth is that we are inviting disaster because guns too often are not being properly stored away from children. Nearly 100 million privately-owned firearms are stored unlocked, with 22 million of these guns left unlocked and loaded; twenty-four percent of children between the ages of 10 and 17 say that they can gain access to a gun in their home; and the Centers for Disease Control estimate that almost 1.2 million elementary school-aged children return from school to a home where there is no adult supervision, but at least one firearm. 
   That is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. 
   Our legislation will help address this problem. It is simple, effective and straightforward. It requires that a child safety device--or trigger lock--be sold with every handgun. These devices vary in form, but the most common resemble a padlock that wraps around the gun trigger and immobilizes it. Trigger locks are already used by tens of thousands of responsible gun owners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use, and they can be purchased in virtually any gun store for less than 10 dollars. 
   This measure gained momentum last Congress, falling short by just one vote in the Judiciary Committee. Moreover, in part as a result of our proposal, a majority of the largest handgun manufacturers in the United States agreed to voluntarily include safety locks with each handgun they manufacture. Despite this unprecedented voluntary step, though, our legislation is still needed. Here's why: because some manufacturers appear to be dragging their feet--an October 1998 study indicated that eighty percent of the handgun makers who signed onto the voluntary agreement were not yet providing safety locks. And even if they do comply, many handguns would likely still not be covered because too many other manufacturers have refused to sign onto our agreement. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to ensure that safety locks are provided with all handguns, and to keep the pressure on handgun manufacturers to put safety first. We already protect children by requiring that seat belts be installed in all automobiles and that childproof safety caps be provided on medicine bottles. We should be no less vigilant when it comes to gun safety.
