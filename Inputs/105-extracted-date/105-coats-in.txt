 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to speak today in recognition of the passage by unanimous consent of the Charter Schools Expansion Act, the bi-partisan bill. Senator Lieberman and I introduced this bill last November to help further expand the charter school movement which is so successfully providing new educational opportunities for children all around the country. This bill passed unanimously out of the Labor Committee and was unanimously approved by the Senate. 
This important bill builds upon the great success of the original charter school legislation which Senator Lieberman and former Senator Durenberger introduced in 1994. It was Senator Durenberger's timeless promotion of charter schools that educated all of us to the promise and the benefit of this important public educational reform initiative. 
The Federal Charter School Grant Program provides seed money to charter school operators to help them pay for the planning, design and initial implementation of a charter school. Since the program's inception, the number of charter schools has tripled, with over 1100 charter schools now operating in 33 States and the District of Columbia. 
Charter schools are independent public schools that have been freed from onerous bureaucratic and regulatory burdens in order to pursue clear objectives and goals aimed at increasing student achievement. To increase student achievement, charter schools are able to design and deliver educational programs tailored to meet the needs of their students and their communities. 
It is the individualized education available to students through charter schools that makes this a desirable educational alternative for many families. Charter schools give families an opportunity to choose the educational setting that best meet their child's needs. For many low-income families in particular, charter schools provide their first opportunity to select an educational setting which is best suited for their child. 
Parents and educators have, in turn, given these programs overwhelmingly high marks. Broad-based studies conducted by the Department of Education and the Hudson Institute show that charters are effectively serving diverse populations, particularly disadvantaged and at-risk children, that traditional public schools have struggled to educate. 
With results like these, it is no wonder that some of the strongest support for charter legislation comes from low-income families. Not only do these parents now have real educational choices, but they are actually needed in the charter school environment for everything from volunteering to coaching, fundraising, and even teaching. This direct involvement of families is helping to build small communities centered around the school. 
Charter schools can be started by anyone interested in providing a quality education: parents, teachers, school administrators, community groups, businesses and colleges can all apply for a charter. And, importantly, if these schools fail to deliver a high-quality education, they will be closed--either through a district or State's accountability measures or from lack of students. Accountability is literally built into the charter school process--the school must comply with the provision in its charter, and unhappy parents and students can leave if they are not satisfied. 
Additionally, a survey conducted last fall by the National School Boards Association (NSBA) found that the charter movement is already having a positive ripple effect that is being felt in many local public school districts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional public schools are working harder to please local families so they won't abandon them to competing charter schools, and that central administrators often see charters as `a powerful tool' to develop new ideas and programs without fearing regulatory roadblocks. 
Several other studies have recently been released highlighting the success of charter schools around the country. Among other things, these studies have shown that charter schools have successfully met and surpassed the standards outlined in their charters, attracted significant proportions of minority and low-income students, and have higher parental approval rates than public schools. 
The results of these studies point to important ways to improve and reinvent public education as a whole. The implications from the success of charter schools indicate that public schools should be consumer-oriented, diverse, results-oriented, and professional places that also function as mediating institutions in their communities. 
The purpose of this bill is to further encourage the growth of high-quality charter schools around the country. This bill provides incentives to encourage States to increase the number of high quality charter schools in their State. To qualify for funding under this bill, States must satisfy two criteria. First, they must provide for review and evaluation of their charter schools by the public chartering agency at least once every five years to ensure that the charter school is meeting the terms of its charter and meeting its academic performance requirements. And second, States meet at least one of three priority criteria: 
The State has demonstrated progress in increasing the number of high quality charter schools that meet clear and measurable objectives for the educational progress of their students; * * * * * 
To help ensure that the amount of the federal grants are proportional to the level of charter school activity in the State, this bill directs the Secretary to take into consideration the number of charter schools in operation, or that have been approved to open. 
During drafting of this bill, the single greatest concern I heard from charter school operators related to their ability to access their fair share of federal education funding. And so, to ensure that charter schools have enough funding to continue once their doors are opened, this bill provides that charter schools get their fair share of federal programs for which they are eligible, such as Title 1 and IDEA. The bill also directs States to inform their charter schools of any Federal funds to which they are entitled. 
This bill also increases the financing options available to charter schools and allows them to utilize funds from the Title VI block grant program for start-up costs. 
Because it is so important that charter schools are held accountable in return for the flexibility they are given from Federal, state and local laws and regulations, this amendment includes several significant provisions which strengthen accountability. First, under the priority 
criteria, States must review and evaluate their charter schools at least once every five years to ensure that they are meeting the terms of their charter and their academic performance requirements. They are rewarded for increasing the number of high quality charter schools that are `held accountable in their charter for meeting clear and measurable objectives for the educational progress of their students.' 
The definitions section of the bill also stresses accountability by requiring a written performance contract with the authorized chartering agency in the State. These written performance contracts include clearly defined objectives for the charter school to meet in return for the autonomy they are given. The performance objectives in the contract are to be measured by State assessments and other assessments the charter wishes to use. 
I am confident that this amendment will build on and contribute to the success of the charter school movement. This bill stresses the need for high quality, accountable schools which are given the autonomy they need to provide the best educational opportunity for their students. 
With the passage of this bill, a strong signal will be sent to parents and teachers all across this country that they are not alone in their struggle to improve education. We hope to ease their struggle by enabling new charter schools to be developed. More charter schools will result in greater accountability, broader flexibility for classroom innovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. I urge my colleagues to increase educational opportunities for all children by supporting this bill. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and thank Senator Lieberman for his tremendous leadership in the area of educational reform. He and I have worked closely on a number of issues over the last several years, and I want to commend him, in particular, for his strong support and leadership on issues concerning increasing educational opportunities for low-income children. He understands so clearly the fundamental importance of providing a high quality education in a safe environmental of our neediest children. In addition to this charter schools bill, which will help to increase educational opportunities for low-income children, Senator Lieberman and I have worked closely for the last 4 years to gain support for publicly-funded scholarships for low-income children. I want to thank him for his unwavering commitment to this issue and his vitally important leadership. His efforts have done much to win bipartisan support for both charter schools and low-income scholarships and I thank him for his strong commitment to our country's neediest children. With the passage of this charter schools bill, Senator Lieberman and I have the pleasure of seeing the first of our joint educational reform initiatives move closer to becoming law.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of people that have been of tremendous service to me during my tenure as a United States Senator. That group is my Indiana staff. 
As I have so often said, whatever success I have achieved during my service as a Senator is greatly attributable to the tireless work of my staff. Their hours are long, and they toil in relative obscurity. However, they do so for the same reason that we as Senator make the sacrifice. They work so hard because they believe in this great nation we serve, and the ideals that are woven into the very fiber of our existence as Americans. 
So much of our work here in the Senate focuses on legislative activity. For that is the stuff of headlines and news stories. However, it is hardly a reflection of one of the most fundamental responsibilities of a United States Senator, and that is providing caring and responsive service to the citizens of our state, the people who's trust we are charged with protecting and serving. And, Mr. President, it is those people serving in my State and regional offices that work so hard to insure that the needs and requests of my Indiana constituents are met with friendly and effective service. They are the front line, they are my eyes and ears in Indiana, and without their hard work, it would be impossible for me to serve effectively. 
As the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana pointed out yesterday, we have a rather unique operation back in Indiana. The senior Senator and I share a combined staff. They have served the state well. I would like to take a moment now to acknowledge my Indiana staff. Kathy Blane, Susan Brouillette, Sarah Dorste, Mark Doude, James Garrett, Amy Gaston, Michelle Mayer, Kevin Paicely, Lane Ralph, Karen Seacat, Libby Sims, Cory Shaffer, Angela Weston, Mike Duckworth, Barbara Keerl, David Graham, Pat McClain, Phil Shaull, Amy Hany, Tim Sanders, and Barb Franz. I believe I have included everyone. If I have not, let them know my appreciation. 
As I have said, the distinguished senior Senator and I have shared staff, and so many will continue to work for the citizens of Indiana. Though some will go on to other endeavors, that same sense of responsibility and public service that has motivated them to date, I am sure will drive them to continue to play a positive role in the lives of Hoosiers for years to come. 
I thank them and salute them.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about a matter which concerns me greatly--the process by which funds are allocated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
The National Institutes of Health is one of the finest institutions of medical research in the World. A commitment to providing the best possible health care has driven the NIH's recruitment of preeminent physicians and medical researchers across the breadth of the medical disciplines. 
Having created such an impressive resource, it is disheartening that Congress, through legislative earmarks and other mandates, often undertakes to second-guess the considered opinions of these experts. 
The practice of earmarking disease-specific funds results mainly from lobbying pressure directed to Senators or our staffs. As a result of this pressure, Senator's introduce language which sets aside sums of money--often very large sums of money--to be used exclusively for one specific disease. 
In September of last year, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which contained a provision for an in-depth study to examine the priority setting process at NIH. The amendment which incorporated this study was originally sponsored by myself and Senator Frist, and directed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct this study with utmost priority. 
The intent of this research was to understand how priorities regarding specific research programs are determined, how levels of funding for these research programs are established, and how new organizational entities within the NIH are created. 
This study grew out of Senator Frist and my concerns that Congress was unduly influencing the process by which priorities are set at NIH through the practice of the earmarking of funds for disease-specific research. We were concerned that the priority setting process at NIH was becoming less science-based and more politically drive. It was clear that our concern was shared by the majority of the Senate, as they voted to include this amendment in the appropriations bill. 
In July of this year, IOM completed its work and reported its findings to Congress. The study cited the need for greater public involvement, specifically, and I quote, `The director of NIH should establish and appropriately staff a Director's Council of Public Representatives, to facilitate interactions between NIH and the general public' and that, `* * * public membership of NIH policy and program advisory groups should be selected to represent a broad range of public constituencies.' unquote. It is interesting to note that both these recommendations focus public input directly to NIH, rather than to Congress. 
This is very much in line with another recommendation; quote, `The U.S. Congress should use its authority to mandate specific research programs, establish level of funding for them, and implement new organizational entities only when other approaches have proven inadequate.' unquote. 
The findings of this study are clear. For the purpose of priority-setting, public input-including organized input via lobbying efforts--are most appropriately directed to NIH, where it can be evaluated by appropriate science-based criteria. Only when there is evidence that NIH is unable or unwilling to apply this input appropriately to their priority-setting process and criteria, should Congress influence the process through legislative mandates. It is my contention that if the litmus test were applied to all earmarks, most would be stripped from legislation. 
The message is clear: Congress should avoid the practice of earmarking within NIH appropriations. The findings of the research conducted by the independent and impartial experts clearly indicates that the concern regarding the pricess of priority setting at NIH was warranted. 
As the Senate considers the future appropriations and authorization legislation for NIH, I would urge my colleagues to consider, with a critical eye, any disease-specific earmarks. I would urge my colleagues to ask themselves whether there is evidence that NIH has somehow failed to appropriately consider and apply science-based priority-setting criteria. In the absence of such evidence, I would urge my colleagues to not impose earmerks or other legislative mandates on the NIH.

The State has demonstrated progress in increasing the number of high quality charter schools that meet clear and measurable objectives for the educational progress of their students; 
The State provides an alternative to the local educational agency as the public chartering agency through either another authorized public chartering agency or an appeals process; or 
The State ensure that each charter school has a high degree of automony over the charter school's budgets and expenditures. 
These priority criteria were included to encourage States to develop charter school laws that promote diversified educational opportunities balanced with high expectations, clear objectives, and strong accountability measures. 
This bill continues the primary focus of charter school grants for the planning, design and implementation costs of new charter schools. This bill adds another purpose for which grants can be used by States--States may now reserve up to 10 percent of their grant funds to support the dissemination activities of successful charter schools. These dissemination grants can go to charter school operators to help encourage education reform by spreading the lessons learned by successful charter schools and assist in the creation of new charters and the reform and reinvigoration of other public schools. 
To help ensure that the amount of the federal grants are proportional to the level of charter school activity in the State, this bill directs the Secretary to take into consideration the number of charter schools in operation, or that have been approved to open.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his kind comments. We have served together in the Labor Committee for a 10-year period of time. While we have had our disagreements, we have also agreed on a number of things. I have enjoyed working with him. 
I understand, but regret, the objection of this unanimous consent request. There obviously is a difference of opinion as to the need for support in the technology industry, the computer industry, particularly with the Y2K problem. That issue will have to be resolved. There is honest disagreement here. We will pick the issue up in the next Congress.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the end of the 105th Congress marks the beginning of my transition from Senator to citizen. This ends 24 years for me of public service: Two in the U.S. Army, four as a legislative assistant and district director for then-Congressman Dan Quayle, and 18 in the Congress. While I look forward to life after politics, I know how much I will miss this place and its people, and so I want to acknowledge some debts. 
I want to acknowledge the privilege of serving under two remarkable Republican leaders and one Democrat majority leader, all of whom I hold a great deal of respect. Senator Mitchell was majority leader when I arrived. He gave me nothing but the utmost courtesy, fairness and respect. I have a great deal of respect for him in the way he conducted this Senate. Senator Dole became my friend and mentor. His life is a tribute to a true patriot and to someone whose commitment to public service, I think, is nearly unequal. Our current leader, Senator Lott, is someone who is a dear friend, someone who I greatly respect, and I think certainly has a great future as majority leader. 
There are many others that have made a deep impression on me and provided friendship and support in ways that I will never be able to adequately acknowledge: The senior Senator from Indiana, whose lifetime of public service serves as a model to many; my staff, who have faithfully and tirelessly served. I have always said good staff makes for good Senators. I don't know if I fit the quality of a good Senator, but I know I had a good staff. Any failings on my part are not due to my staff, they are due to me. They have been exceptional. I think they are the best Senate staff assembled. I say that for the very few who are left that have not secured employment. Some of you are passing up great opportunities if you don't grab them. 
I have had three very, very able administrative assistants, chiefs of staff: David Hoppe, who now serves as the floor's chief of staff and served with me for my first 4 years; David Gribbin, who many of you know, assistant secretary of staff for Dick Cheney for many, many years in the House; and now Sharon Soderstrom. All have been exceptional chiefs of staff. They have assembled a wonderful staff. 
The Senate support team: All those who man the desks and work the cloakroom and make sure we vote on time; the guards who protect us and make sure we are safe in our jobs; the staff who serve us, and the people who make this place work, they are a family. They have treated me like part of the family. I have tried to treat them as part of the family. They make it possible for us to do so many things and they certainly deserve our acknowledgment. 
Our Chaplain, who has meant so much to me from a spiritual perspective, and my colleagues, my friends, who I can't begin to thank; those who share my ideals and have voted with me and those who don't but who have engaged in respectful, meaningful dialog in debate, and who, at the end of the debate, we have been able to meet at the center aisle, shake hands, acknowledge, `Well done, we will get you next time,' or `See you at the next debate?'--all of those mean a great deal to me. I come from here with many, many memories. 
I want to thank my wife for her love and support and sacrifice. She is the best mother that any three children could ever have had. She has been a father many times when I haven't been there to do the job as a father. My children have been 
patient and had stolen moments which I will never be able to recover. I thank my colleagues, as I said, those who have shared ideals and those who we had honorable and honest disagreement. Finally, the people of Indiana who have seen fit to elect me many times to the Congress and twice to the Senate, thank you for giving me a privilege beyond my ability to earn the privilege of their trust, the honor of their votes. 
In times of change you become reflective, and it is nice to think about your accomplishments. It is also a time to reflect on unfinished business, business that I hope will help shape the direction of this Congress that some have indicated an interest in, and hopefully others will pick up that interest. 
By constitutional design, the measure of success in the Senate, I think, is different from other parts of government. We are employed to take a longer view, insulated from the rush of hours to see the needs of future years. This is the theory. In practice, the pace of politics makes this very different, very difficult. This has been the greatest source of personal frustration during my years in this institution, that we have not spent nearly enough time dealing with the larger issues that face us, things that will matter down the road, topics that will be chapters in American history, not footnotes in the Congressional Record. 
If you allow me the privilege, I will briefly mention three of those matters that I trust will remain central to the questions of our time. 
All of you know of my interest in the issue of life. I believe there is no higher call of government than to protect the most defenseless among us. There is no greater honor in this Senate than to use our voice to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. Perhaps uniquely among our deliberations, the cause of life is informed and ennobled by a simple truth: Humanity is not an achievement. It is an endowment, and that that endowment is made by a Creator who gives inalienable rights, first among them the right to life. This is a founding principle of our political tradition. It is the teaching of our moral heritage. And it is the demand of our conscience. 
Abraham Lincoln wrote of our Founders:  
This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble understanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures. . . . In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on. . . . They grasped not only the whole race of man then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their children, and their children's children, and the countless myriads who should inhabit the Earth in other ages. 
My question is, Will that beacon shine for all our children, those born and yet to be born? Or will we, in the name of personal liberty, stamp out the divine image and likeness of the most defenseless of all? I believe it is one of the central questions of our time. 
I know we are divided on that issue. I hope, though, that we would all put aside some of the harsh rhetoric and continue to engage in the discussion about the meaning and the value of life and what our duties and responsibilities are to protect that life, to expand the ever-widening circle of inclusion that our great democracy is known for: bringing women, the defenseless, the handicapped, African-Americans and minorities within this circle of protection in our democracy. And I believe--my personal view, and I hope one we would certainly debate and discuss--that extends to the unborn. 
Secondly, another great issue that I believe demands our continued attention is the long-term strength of our Nation, the resource and planning that we devote to the defense of liberty. Here we are, not weak as a nation, but I fear that we are on a trajectory toward weakness--that our power and authority are being spent and not accumulated. 
It has been one of the highest callings and privileges for this Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and to use that position to advance the cause of our men and women in uniform. I deeply respect and honor those who have served our Nation in war and peace as watchmen on the wall of freedom, but the test of our appreciation is measurable by the firmness of our determination that their lives will not be needlessly sacrificed because we have allowed the deterrent power of America's military to decay. The history of this country is a history of military victories, but it is also a history of how our Nation often invited future conflict and unnecessary loss of American life by too swiftly disarming after our victories and squandering the opportunities of peace. 
In 1939, Army Chief of Staff, Malin Craig said: 
What transpires on prospective battlefields is influenced vitally years before in the councils of the staff and in the legislative halls of Congress. Time is the only thing that may be irrevocably lost, and it is the first thing lost sight of in the seductive false security of peaceful times. 
Mr. President, I believe we have been living in peaceful times. We have enjoyed prosperity and peace that is almost unprecedented in America these past several years. I fear that storm clouds are gathering, however, on America's horizon, that the `seductive false security of our peaceful times' is fast fading. We see a frightening proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We see worldwide terrorism, much of it directed at Americans and American interests. We see political instability and human suffering, social disorder resulting from ethnic hatred, power-hungry dictators, and the very real prospect of global financial distress with all of its attendant consequences. All of this, I believe, calls for eternal vigilance, a national defense second to none, a military equal to the threats of a new century. 
We have a unique opportunity, I believe, and a strategic pause that is fast fading to build a new military equal to the new challenges and the new threats of the future. Closer to home, it is my hope that the Senate, in every future debate on social policy, will focus on the role of families, churches and community institutions in meeting human needs and touching human souls. This is a world of heroic commitment and high standards and true compassion that must be respected and fostered and protected, not harassed or undermined by Government or Hollywood. It is a world of promise that I urge all of you to take the time to discover. 
I believe our Nation needs a bold, new definition of compassion. We need compassion that shows good outcomes, not just good intentions. We need to get rid of the destructive welfare culture. We have taken a great step in that direction, but we still need to fulfill our responsibilities to the less fortunate and disadvantaged, the children and the helpless. We need to abandon our illusions about Government bureaucracies, but we still need to keep our human decency. 
How is this possible? I am convinced there is a way--a hopeful new direction for change, because there are people and institutions in our society that can reach and change these things. Families and neighborhoods, churches, charities, and volunteer associations have the tools to transform people's lives. They can demand individual responsibility. They can practice tough love. They can offer moral values and spiritual renewal--things that Government can't do, and we should not want Government to do. 
I believe a bold, new definition of compassion will adopt this bold dream: to break the monopoly of Government as a provider of compassion and return its resources to individuals, churches, synagogues, charities, volunteer associations, community organizations and others. This, I believe, is the next step of the welfare debate and the next stage of reform, the next frontier of compassion in America. 
Before I close, let me add a personal note, and it is difficult for me to say this. I have deliberated long on whether I should say this. But I believe, since I am not going to be here next year, this is something I would want to have said. So allow me to briefly do that. 
I resolved when I came here, like many of you, from the moment I took the oath, that I would do my best not to do anything to bring this body into disrepute, that I would try not to tarnish it by word or action, that whatever I did in public policy, I would try my best not to contribute to public cynicism or a diminishing of the office. I think all of us feel this burden. It is one of the reasons that I believe this impeachment process, which we are contemplating, which looms large on the horizon of this Senate, has to be taken seriously. I don't presume that any of us should draw a conclusion at this point. But I believe it is a serious thing to consider. I don't believe that moral deregulation of public office is ratified by public apathy. It will be a terrible thing if the ethical expectations of public office are allowed to wither. The Nation could double its wealth, but we could have a shrunken legacy. I believe each of you who will be here have a high duty and moral responsibility to address this with the utmost seriousness and the absolute smallest amount of partisanship that is possible, and I speak to my colleagues on the Republican side, as well as the Democrat side. 
It is my hope that when the time comes, the Senate will give evidence to the ideals that I have seen displayed so many times in this body. I believe these things strongly, but I don't want to end on this point. I make the points because I have learned from so many here in the Senate and from so many great Americans who served before me how honorable public service can be. I am not leaving the Senate disillusioned in any way. I leave having seen how important and how sometimes noble elective office can be, after nearly two decades of service. I believe in this job and in its goals, and I am confident that the country is well served by my many friends and colleagues who will continue to serve and lead this institution. 
Again, I thank my great State of Indiana and the people and friends who made it possible for me to serve here. I thank my God for the privilege of service in this place, and I thank each of you for being my friends and my colleagues and leaving me with memories that I will never, ever forget. I will leave here extolling this institution as the greatest deliberative body in the greatest country in the history of the world, and I have been privileged to be a part of it. Thank you very much. 
[Applause.]

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 1970, Congress passed provisions known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO, as part of the larger Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The bill was designed to help law enforcement officials better address the plague of organized crime, and has been a valuable tool in this effort. 
During drafting of this legislation, concerns were raised by several members of this body, including my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, that the bill was written so broadly that it might be used against organized civil disobedience, including anti-war demonstrators. This was at the height of the Vietnam War, and anti-war demonstrations were taking place across the country. Senator Kennedy, along with Senator Hart of Michigan, submitted their views as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the Organized Crime Control Act of 1969.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, allow me to thank my colleagues for their kind words and also for their assistance. 
At a time when our two parties are often divided over issues, major issues, this is truly a bipartisan effort. This is something that could not have been achieved without the cooperation, support, help and assistance of people on both sides of the aisle. I thank the chairman and Senator Kennedy for their work with us on this. I thank my counterpart on the Children and Families Subcommittee, Senator Dodd; Senator Gregg has been a supporter of this effort, and others on the committee who have worked hard and worked diligently with us to bring us to this particular point. 
Each of the four programs that are encompassed in this bill represent an all too rare occurrence--a forging of public and private partnership to combat the effects of poverty and unleashing the vast resources of one of our most important assets, the local community. 
The first component of this bill is the reauthorization of Head Start, a program that has proven to be significant in providing an opportunity for children to realize their full potential. It was more than a decade ago that Congressman George Miller and I, as chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Children, Youth and Family Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, asked the General Accounting Office to do an analysis of all of the programs that affected children, youth and families under the title and the theme of what works, what doesn't and why. It was a 2-year exhaustive study, and it came back listing eight Federal programs that provided real tangible benefits and a real return on the investment of the taxpayer's dollar and encouraged support for those programs. 
At the head of the list, No. 1 on the list was Head Start. It said that for the taxpayer's investment in providing low-income, disadvantaged children with opportunities to prepare to enter the educational system, he or she was saving an enormous amount of money that would have had to be spent on remedial education and would have been potentially lost because those children were not prepared to enter the educational system. Since that time, I have been an ardent supporter of Head Start, in trying to provide funds for Head Start and also to make sure the program is effective. It is a program that clearly has provided many millions of children opportunities that they would not have otherwise had. 
However, having said that, there have been questions about the quality of the program. We have experienced varying degrees of quality, from excellent in some cases to very poor in other cases. With the 1994 reauthorization, Congress and the administration made a commitment to enhance the focus on quality improvement. Since the last reauthorization, the Head Start bureau has offered technical assistance, resources and support to Head Start programs that are committed to pursuing excellence--again, something that is all too rare. We have also terminated, actually terminated grants to those programs that were experiencing deficiencies to the extent that they could not be remedied. 
Close to 100 Head Start grantees have been terminated or have relinquished their grants since 1994--the first time in history that deficient programs were actually recompeted. These are essential. Too often here we authorize a new program with glowing words and the best of direction that we can provide, only to find later that those programs did not match up to the promise, and yet they are continued, they are perpetuated, they continue to receive funding, we continue to support mediocrity or even worse. 
We have, through the actions in 1994 and subsequent, infused into the Head Start Program not only the technical assistance and resources and support necessary, but also the oversight and the investigation and the determination that we are either going to make some of these programs that are deficient, better, or we are going to recompete them--and, as I said, more than 100 have been recompeted. 
The reauthorization bill that we are dealing with today builds on that commitment by requiring that 60 percent of the Head Start funds in the first years go toward enhancing program quality. It is important that we expand Head Start. We obviously want to get as many children in the program as possible, but it does no good to expand the program, to enroll more children, if the existing programs are not providing the health and the benefit and the quality that the children need to give them that edge that they need. So the emphasis on quality early and expansion later, I think, is the proper emphasis. 
We also take steps to make sure Head Start students obtain the goal of school readiness by requiring the establishment of educational performance standards to ensure that the children develop a minimum level of literacy awareness and understanding coupled with very specific measures to help us assess whether or not this program is actually working. Under this scenario, poor programs, poorly administered programs, will be identified, they will be offered technical assistance, and if they fail to correct the deficiencies, they will be terminated and the grant recompeted. 
We have responded to the concerns of Head Start programs to be able to more fully address the emerging needs of working families for full-day, full-year services, by significantly enhancing the Collaboration Grant Program in current law by requiring active collaboration between Head Start and other early care in education programs within the State, and we have included the President's request for an expansion of early Head Start programs from the current 7.5 percent in fiscal year 1999 to 10 percent in fiscal year 2003. 
Finally, in response to concerns raised about the lack of reliable research on Head Start, which can be used as a basis for determining its effectiveness, we have authorized the National Impact Study of Head Start. These studies will yield very valuable information about how this program is working and whether Head Start is, in fact, making a difference. 
Mr. President, the whole emphasis here, as you can tell, is on sufficient oversight, sufficient involvement in the program, to determine how it is working and to establish and identify where it is not working, and to help make where it is not working better and, if not, if necessary, recompeting the whole process and turning it over to someone else. 
There are three other components of this particular bill before us. One is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I will allow other Members, including the chairman, to address that. That is an issue they have been involved in more directly than I have. 
Another is the Community Services Block Grant, an excellent example of what can happen when Washington allows local communities to design their own responses to local problems. The `Washington knows best,' the `Washington has one model formula that fits all sizes,' is pretty much a discounted and discarded theory. We are working now, and need to work, with local communities to identify local problems and allow them to help us and work with us in fashioning a local solution. 
Mr. President, 90 percent of the funds provided under this act, the Community Services Block Grant, must be passed through by the State to local eligible entities, which include a variety of public and nonprofit organizations, community action agencies, and faith-based neighborhood organizations. 
We made some important improvements in this act, requiring each State to participate in a performance measurement system, again to determine effectiveness of programs and make sure they are meeting their program goals and priorities. 
We have reauthorized a number of subcomponents of this--the Community Economic Development Program, the Rural Economic Development Program, National Youth Sports, the Community Food and Nutrition Program--and created a new program called the Neighborhood Innovation Projects, so that grants to private, neighborhood-based nonprofits can test or assist in the development of new approaches and developments in dealing with these community problems. These grants may be used for a variety of purposes, including gang interventions, addressing school violence, or any other purposes identified by the community as a problem resulting from poverty and consistent with the purposes of this CSBG. 
Finally, let me address a program that has been near and dear to my heart, something that has been part of the Project for American Renewal that I authored some time ago. This is a 5-year demonstration program entitled `Assets for Independence.' It is designed to encourage low-income individuals to develop strong habits for saving money. It is an IRA for low-income people. The current IRA program really is only available to those who have assets readily available or accessible to put 
into this saving program. The Assets for Independence Act allows sponsoring organizations to provide participating individuals and families intensive financial counseling and assistance in developing investment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship. 
I am excited about this new program. As I said, it is part of the Project for American Renewal legislation I first introduced in 1995. It is estimated that our 5-year investment of $100 million in asset building through these individual accounts will generate 7,000-plus new businesses, 70,000 new jobs, $730 million in additional earnings, 12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, 6,600 families removed from welfare rolls, and 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college degrees. 
Each of the programs we are authorizing today represents an effort to give people a hand up, not simply a handout. They are an acknowledgment that when one family suffers, we all suffer as Americans; when communities break down, we all pay a price, and therefore we all have a stake in helping people achieve the American dream. 
The legislation recognizes the limits of government and the fact that many of our worst social problems will never be solved by government alone. We are beginning to recognize that there are people and institutions, families, churches, synagogues, parishes, community volunteer organizations, faith-based charities, that are able to communicate societal ideals and restore individual hope, and we need to allow those organizations to compete to provide services, and we have done so in each of the programs I have described. 
Community activist Robert Woodson makes the point that every social problem, no matter how severe, is currently being defeated somewhere by some volunteer community group, faith-based organization, or others. This is now one of America's great untold stories. No alternative approach to our cultural crisis holds such promise, because these institutions have resources denied to government at every level, resources of love, spiritual vitality, and true compassion. 
Mr. President, I have been proud to be associated with one organization entitled Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. I have been with them now for 26 years as a Big Brother as a local board member, board president, now as the president of the national board. This, along with organizations like Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and others, provides just one example of how local volunteer organizations can provide volunteers who can provide help to children to give them the kind of mentoring and support they need in difficult years, growing up often in one-parent families or families with poverty. 
There are examples of this all across the board. The Gospel Rescue Ministry's efforts across the country have reached out to drug-addicted homeless individuals and provided astounding support. Whether the problem is teen pregnancy, school dropouts, school violence, children without fathers--whatever--there are organizations that we need to tap into, support, and enhance their involvement, providing support for young people and addressing social problems in this country. 
Mr. President, I see my time is expiring. I did not mean to go on as long as I have. I hope I have not used up all the time. I know Senator Kennedy and others are on the floor to talk about this. These programs, I believe, the ones we are reauthorizing, represent the true measure of our compassion as a nation. 
I want to end by giving credit to Stephanie Johnson, who has poured her heart and soul into this reauthorization. She has given more than any one person can ask, making this a reality. This would not have happened without her involvement. Good staff makes good Senators, and she is the epitome of good staff. I thank her personally and publicly for her work in making this, and many of the things that have happened within our committee, a reality. 
With that, I appreciate the extra time and yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I begin by thanking my colleague and my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his friendship over the years as a Member of the Congress, in the last 10 years as a Member of the Senate, for his tireless work on a number of important issues facing this country, and for his willingness to take on this issue, as difficult as the negotiations have been, to persevere, to bring it to this particular point. Senator Nickles has provided effective leadership and perseverance in resolving what I think is one of the most important issues that this Senate will be dealing with in this session of Congress. 
There are many others and I will mention some of those names at a later point. 
The United States, which we are privileged and pleased to be citizens of, has long been considered a pillar of freedom around the world. Our Nation was founded by individuals fleeing persecution and discrimination throughout Europe. The founding documents of our country enshrine the value and principle of religious freedom. The very first clause of the first amendment guarantees each of us the right of free exercise of religion and prohibits our Government from dictating or establishing how we will worship and what we will believe. 
Freedom of religion is enshrined in our founding documents because freedom of religion is a basic human right. In our country, this freedom is acknowledged as a right endowed not by man, not by those who wrote those documents, but by our Creator. Therefore, they are unalienable and cannot be removed. 
Religious freedom is also recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948. That declaration guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to choose one's own religious belief, to worship, to observe and practice one's belief individually or corporately. The freedom to practice one's religion without fear of outside intervention is the most fundamental liberty that any human being can possess. 
We have a history as a country of concern not only for our own religious freedom but also for religious freedom in other countries. We want to stand as a beacon for religious freedom because we believe it goes to the most basic and most essential of all human freedoms and all human rights. 
The cold war brought considerable national attention to the plight of Soviet Jews who faced extreme religious intolerance and persecution. United States concerns ultimately translated into national policy, including the enactment of the Jackson-Vanik law which tied trade with the Soviet Union and other Communist nations to their allowing Jews to emigrate--just one example of how this Nation has translated into policy these basic fundamental beliefs. 
By contrast, there has been little focus lately, unfortunately, on some of the increasing persecution of Christians and some of the horrific persecution of Christians and other peoples of faith around the world. As a nation, we have assumed a responsibility, a moral imperative, to raise the basic human rights issues, the basic examples of persecution, to use the tools available to us to motivate change toward these individuals in various countries around the world practicing various faiths. Individuals are persecuted for that belief and that practice. 
It is evident that many people--not just Christians, but several faiths--suffer because of their faith. The form that these attacks take can be everything from discrimination in employment, denial of participation in the political process, denial of common rights of citizenship. But these attacks can also take the form of extreme physical harm, torture, imprisonment, slavery, and even death. A fact of our time, the fact of the history of mankind, is that people have been persecuted and are being persecuted for their religious belief and for their faith. There are abuses in many places around the world of people persecuted simply because of what they believe. 
Paul Marshall, in his book, `Their Blood Cries Out,' effectively chronicles where persecution is occurring. In great detail, he presents a comprehensive view of this problem throughout the world. His exhaustive survey simply cannot be ignored. It is a powerful and persuasive analysis which ultimately begs the question: What will we do? How will we respond? Will we respond? Is there action that we can take? 
He talks about offenses in countries around the world--these have been documented--in Sudan, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cuba, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and others. 
In the Sudan, possibly the worst of the offenders, it is not just Christians who have faced persecution, but Muslims and Animists, who have opposed the repressive tactics of the Islamic military regime which took power in 1989. Many Arab Muslims from the north have been arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed. Christians driven from their homelands to government-controlled areas of the country are forced to renounce their faith in order to receive basic food. Others, including black Africans, are forced to convert to Islam and are even enslaved. All told, 1.5 million people have been killed by this totalitarian regime and another 5 million have been displaced from their homes. 
In Pakistan, Paul Marshall describes the problem not as one of state-directed intolerance, but as one due to the growth of militant Islamic forces attacking Christians. Christian Pakistanis often become the victims of murder. The blasphemy law, passed in 1986, requires death sentences to any who blasphemes against the Prophet Mohammed or the Qu'ran. This law has given way to a wave of terror against Christians and other religious minorities. 
Buddhist and Christians in Vietnam are subject to arrest and harassment if they are not part of the officially recognized churches. As in China, government control over religion seems due to fear of loss of control over the people. Paul Marshall writes that `priests and pastors are assaulted, harassed, fined, sentenced to re-education camps and imprisoned. Many die in prison, some of them after torture.' 
In Cuba as well, the government attempts to rigidly control religion. Churches cannot run schools or use mass communications. They are prohibited from performing missionary work and the distribution of religious material is controlled. There has, however, been tremendous growth in churches in Cuba, primarily in the form of house churches. The Cuban Government has also sought to restrict religion by imposing a ban on the sale of paper, ink, typewriters, computers and other printing device to any religious organization. 
In Iran, those who believe in the Baha'i faith are forcibly repressed by the Iranian Government. They are denied the right to assemble and elect their religious officials, their property is confiscated and they are denied basic civil and legal rights. More than 200 Baha'is have been killed in Iran since 1989. Christians and Jews likewise face persecution in Iran, including discrimination, imprisonment, and death. One Christian human rights groups describes the treatment of Christians and Jews as `Religious apartheid.' 
In Saudi Arabia, only the practice of the Sunni form of Islam is permitted. No public expression of 
Christianity is allowed. Those found with Bibles or crosses can be tortured and arrested. The Saudi Government even went so far as to demand that a Christian group meeting in the American Consulate be disbanded. Unfortunately, our Consulate obliged them by closing worship service, this in an American Embassy. 
In China, the Christian home churches are flourishing despite the Communist government moves to strictly control churches. I trust we are familiar with the accounts of thousands of Catholic and Protestant Chinese who have been imprisoned for worshiping, preaching and distributing Bibles. 
This is but a handful of examples of where intolerance occurs around the world. Clearly, we cannot hold each nation and people to the same standard we have in the United States. But neither can we ignore the dramatic, reprehensible, and documented accounts of what is happening. 
Yet it is clear we cannot oversimplify the problem of religious intolerance in these and other countries. While persecution in some countries is the direct result of official government policy, in others, persecution is undertaken by groups and individuals, with no attempt by the governing officials to intervene. Further, while some religious persecution is simply part of an overall repressive regime eager to control the lives of the people, other persecution is specifically targeted at religious freedoms. 
In addition, the promotion of human rights, including religious freedom, is only one interest of the United States in conducting foreign policy. We also must promote strong relations with countries vital to our national security and pursue policies designed to promote our economic interests. 
Yet as a Nation, especially a Nation with our heritage, we cannot close our eyes to real abuses and persecutions taking place. We cannot stand idly by, complacent, apathetic, pretending to be ignorant. Because we are not ignorant. We must act wisely, but we must act. We need a comprehensive policy which draws greater attention to specific problems and works to change behavior. We must have a balance, always keeping in mind the plight of individuals and the role the United States can play in changing the behavior of other governments. Religious liberty has been our gift from the founders of this country; it is also our responsibility, and our torch to bear. 
The Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad issued an interim report in January 1998. That report described our policy goals in this way:  
The aim of U.S. foreign policy in this area should be to influence governments, with both positive and negative inducements and through public and private diplomacy, to live up to international standards of religious freedom. 
This legislation can, first of all, alert us to the situations as they exist around the world, and then provide us a road map in terms of how we can most effectively address them. 
The bill before us, introduced by Senators Nickel, Specter and Lieberman, is designed to promote and elevate religious freedom in our Nation's conduct of foreign policy. My friends on the House side, led by Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, have been tireless in pressing for this issue. I would like to take a moment to give credit to Congressman Wolf who has, without a doubt, been the most persistent and relentless advocate of our taking action to address the problem of religious freedom, together with Chris Smith, and others in the House of Representatives. They have provided the impetus for this action and they have, through persuasion and education of Members of the House, alerted them to the problem that exists and achieved a very significant vote in favor of what was then the Wolf-Specter bill. That bill has passed the House of Representatives and now, in the waning hours of the 105th Congress, the Senate, after exhaustive negotiations, after a process that has gone on for an extraordinary amount of time, finds itself at this place. 
Mr. President, a great number of people deserve credit for this work, including John Hanford of Senator Lugar's staff, Steve Moffitt, and my own very able legislative assistant, Pam Sellars, and others on Senator Nickles' staff and Senator Lieberman's staff, have worked tirelessly to fashion legislation that will survive the myriad of procedural processes that we have to go through here in order to bring a bill to the floor, particularly in the waning hours. A great deal of effort and work has been put into making this a reality. I am so pleased that we stand here this evening on the verge of passage of what I think is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation. 
This presents a viable policy to strengthen religious freedoms abroad. The bill is balanced in its approach, it is comprehensive in its treatment, and it enables our Nation to custom-tailor our response to religious persecution in other lands. It puts in place measures which institutionalize our Nation's historic principles and religious liberty in our relations with other nations. 
We establish an ambassador for international religious freedom to help the State Department in assessing nations which engage or tolerate religious persecution and to help promote religious freedom. We set up a process to ensure that the State Department is adequately focusing on religious freedom issues by requiring them to report to the Congress. Each year, State will issue a country-wide assessment of religious freedom abroad with specific summaries of which countries are improving their records and in what ways our Government is actively engaging to change behavior that is not acceptable. 
Most important, this bill establishes an independent commission of experts, appointed by the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, to monitor religious freedom on an ongoing basis and to make recommendations to Congress on actions the U.S. can take in countries when persecution occurs. This is important because this is information that we need. We no longer will be able to simply consign religious persecution and religious freedom to some clip we might read in the paper, or to some report that might come across our desk. We will have a commission constituted of reputable individuals, knowledgeable individuals, who will be able to present to us, on an annual basis, a detailed report of exactly what we are facing around the world. That can be the basis for this Congress and that can be the basis for the State Department and the administration--whichever administration is in power--to take significant action and specific action to address these problems. I think that is the most important part of this bill and the one that will provide the impetus for our taking effective action. 
There are a number of other provisions, and Senator Nickles has laid some of them out--and others will discuss those--each of which is important to the success of this legislation. 
On May 14, 1998, the House passed Congressman Wolf's legislation--the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act--by an overwhelming margin of 375-41. Again, I commend my colleague, Frank Wolf, for his leadership on this issue. His efforts, along with a number of others, have brought recognition of the plight of people of faith throughout the world to our attention. 
It is now time for us to act. It is time for us to establish an effective foreign policy which can respond to religious persecution that we find around the world and which seeks to change the behavior of those responsible. I trust that the Senate will follow what the House has done and demonstrate a strong, if not unanimous, vote for this bill. 
Mr. President, in closing, I want to quote from the Statement of Conscience, issued by the National Evangelical Association on January 23, 1996: 
Religious liberty is not a privilege to be granted or denied by an all-powerful state, but a God-given human right. Indeed, religious liberty is the bedrock principle that animates our Republic and defines us as a people. We must share our love of religious liberty with other peoples, who in the eyes of God are our neighbors. Hence, it is our responsibility and that of the Government that represents us, to do everything we can to secure the blessing of religious liberty to all those suffering from religious persecution. 
Mr. President, we in this country cannot begin to comprehend what people of faith in other nations have had to endure. They have had to put their health, their wealth, their family, their fortunes, and their very lives on the line. Many lives have been sacrificed in the name of religious expression, religious belief. The persecution, which takes place in many countries around this world, is almost too horrible to describe. As a Nation, as a people who have been so blessed with the freedom of religious belief, the least we can do is to hold ourselves out as an example and model to many nations around the world, but, more importantly, demonstrate through our policy that this violent human rights issue is an issue that cannot be ignored, sacrificed to trade, sacrificed to diplomatic relations, or to anything. 
The basic human right, endowed by our Creator, for freedom of worship, freedom of belief, is something that the world desperately needs, something that we can promote. This legislation is designed to do that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I cannot emphasize enough my deep conviction that we must act swiftly on this issue on which our country has, unfortunately, been silent on too long. We are now acting. We have come to that point. It is with great joy, I believe, in our hearts and in the hearts of people of faith throughout the world that the Senate will enact this. Our deep hope and belief is that the President of the United States will sign it and it will become the official policy of the United States. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know our colleague, Senator Lieberman, is on his way over to speak on this bill. I want to take this opportunity to say how much his presence and his involvement on this issue was necessary to our forging a bipartisan consensus on this. 
I think it is important that we speak with one voice as a nation on an issue as critical as religious persecution. It was the work of Senator Lieberman, primarily on the other side of the aisle, that allowed us to address some of the concerns of some of our colleagues--many of them legitimate concerns--and to work through the process, convince his colleagues that what we were attempting to do was done in a way that addressed their concerns. Really, without his help we could not have forged this bipartisan consensus. So while he is not here for me to praise him personally, I just want to let the Record show that the combination of Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and everybody in between, resulted in a consensus bill that I think sends a very, very important message and, really, a beacon of hope and light. 
I am hoping the vote tomorrow will be unanimous, and I think it may be. A lot of that credit goes to Senator Lieberman and also, as I said earlier, a lot of that credit goes to the bill's chief sponsor here in the Senate, Senator Nickles, who patiently worked through trials and tribulations, weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, in order to pull this together and get everybody on board. That appears to be what we have, and we are looking forward to a solid vote tomorrow. Again, my compliments to all of those who played such an important role in that.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't believe we will need all 20 minutes. There may be other Members who want to speak on this. But I will summarize this in the interest of time, because essentially what we are doing here is something that has already been done in the Senate. It has been passed unanimously by the Senate. But it is not attached to legislation that has as much chance of succeeding, or at least, if that legislation succeeds, we are not sure what the Senate has passed is going to survive the process. It might be dropped from that. 
Let me begin by summarizing this just to refresh my colleagues' memory of what we have done before. 
This amendment exempts from the moratorium which, if this bill passes--and I believe it will--will be applied to any kind of a taxation on the World Wide Web--my amendment simply exempts from that moratorium any commercial porn site on the World Wide Web that does not comply with the reasonable requirements that are incorporated in this amendment to restrict access by children to sexually explicit material on the site. 
The amendment establishes specific measures that porn site operators--commercial porn site operators--must take to restrict access. These restrictions represent standard technology already on the web, and they reflect the technology and the requirements acknowledged by the Court as both technically and economically feasible. 
In the Reno v. ACLU case--that is, the Court's decision that struck down the indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act--the Court said there were two problems with that act. 
That act, by the way, is the one that was passed by the Senate in I think a nearly unanimous vote. It was labeled the Exon-Coats amendment, offered in the last Congress by the Senator from Nebraska, the Democrat Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, and myself. We included in that amendment--which passed both the House and the Senate and was endorsed wholeheartedly by the President and the administration but did not survive a Court challenge for two reasons: 
One, the Court said that the restrictions had to apply only to those engaged in the business; that is, those commercial providers. 
Second, it said that our standard of indecency as described in the material not suitable for children was not acceptable, violated first amendment concerns, and they proscribed then a standard as harmful to minors, or suggested that. 
We went back and adjusted that Communications Decency Act which was passed by the Congress, signed into law, but rejected by the Court. We revised it to comply with the Court's concerns, so that now it, we believe, will meet the constitutional standard. We have applied it strictly to commercial sites. We have adopted the requirements for establishing the types of technology that the commercial porn providers and the net can require that one will have to comply with and the other require, and we have adopted the definition of `harmful to minors' as outlined in the famous case on this issue, the Ginsberg, New York Ginsberg case. That defined `harmful to minors' in a way that means you have to be under 17, it has to be patently offensive as to what is suitable for minors, taken as a whole lacking serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors and appealing to prurient interests. 
This is a standard that we are all familiar with. It has been the standard applied in obscenity cases now for several decades, and it is the generally accepted standard. That is the standard we have put into this bill. 
So to summarize, what we are doing here is attaching to this legislation, which provides a tax moratorium for users of the World Wide Web, we are saying that that moratorium does not exist, will not be available to those who use the World Wide Web for the purpose of providing sexually explicit material to minors and have not put in place in terms of their provision to all other users restrictions which are technically feasible and already used, which are economically feasible, but restrictions which allow them to certify that the person requesting the material is, in fact, an adult; that is, 17 years and older. 
This is exactly the language which was adopted unanimously by this Senate in this Congress. And so everyone here has already read it, understood it, voted for it, supported it. We are simply transferring it now over to this particular bill and applying it in a somewhat different way by denying the tax exemption. 
It is inconceivable that we would grant a massive tax perk to commercial porn sites that make their smut available to children. We are going to give a golden egg to commercial entities on the Internet, or giving them a tax shelter, at least a moratorium for a tax shelter for a period of time, but to think that we would give that same tax break to those who are providing obscene material to minors without requiring any good-faith effort on their part to make sure that minors do not have free access to this material is unthinkable. That is the bottom line.

Mr. COATS. I am more than happy to accept the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut. I thank him for his tireless work on behalf of children. It has been my pleasure to serve with him on both sides, the majority and minority, of the Children and the Families Committee; under his chairmanship as ranking member, and now as chairman, with Senator Dodd as ranking member. He has been a tireless advocate of children and addressing the particular concerns that children have to deal with, the problems they have to deal with growing up, and his support for this legislation and the amendment to my amendment, which I think strengthens what we are attempting to do and is very reasonable, earlier offered by Senator McCain, to utilize the advantages of software that allows for blocking. 
We see this as, certainly, a useful tool. It is not a totally useful tool because there are a myriad of ways of defeating it. As we speak, there are undoubtedly computer people far more savvy than this Senator, looking for ways to bypass this and looking for ways to defeat it. But it is a helpful tool, and it should be available to parents to help them in their efforts to protect their children from material that they do not deem appropriate and that certainly is not appropriate. 
I will be more than happy to accept the amendment. I do not know that we need a rollcall vote on both. We can combine the two and I think we will have a very worthwhile amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words from my colleagues--the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Arizona. I am also appreciative of their support for this effort. 
I don't know if any of us has a perfect answer to this. We do see the Internet, the World Wide Web, as one of the most extraordinary invasions in the history of mankind. It can provide access to information that can revolutionize our world and provide opportunities for people who heretofore have not had those opportunities for knowledge and for learning that are extraordinary. 
At the same time, there is a dark side to the Internet. As with most new technology, it can be used for good; it can be used for evil. Unfortunately, the Internet is no exception. None of us want to put ourselves in the position of being a censor. We decry that material. We don't think it sends the right kind of moral message. We wish we didn't have it. 
Yet, as a country dedicated to the freedom of speech, enshrined in its Constitution, we have to accept certain types of material that some of us consider offensive, but doesn't necessarily meet the obscenity test that the Court has laid out, which is a pretty stringent test. 
By the same token, surely--surely--we as a society can address the issue of how we protect the innocence of our children and whether we can use reasonable means to give parents tools to protect that innocence. That is what this amendment is about. 
Software is an attempt to do that. We know from documented evidence that software is only a partial solution, that it can be defeated, but I think it is helpful and we ought to utilize that and encourage it. 
Beyond that, however, we need a sanction, a sanction that imposes some requirements--technologically feasible requirements and economically feasible requirements--on those who seek to bypass the effort to put any kind of restrictions on the availability of this material to children. 
We passed legislation earlier, the Communications Decency Act. Even though the Congress and the people of America and the President supported it, the Court did not support it. It struck it down. We have carefully modified and changed this language in this bill that I offered earlier that the Senate passed to comply with those Court restrictions. 
We have made sure that it applies to minors; that the requirements put in place meet the Court's standard; that the language harmful to minors meets the Court-ordered test that was given to us years ago in the Ginsberg case. We believe we have something here that not only is acceptable to the American people and to the Congress of the United States and to the administration, but hopefully acceptable to the standards imposed by the Supreme Court. 
So I thank my colleagues for their generous words. I thank them for their support. 
The hour of 12 noon having approached, if there is any time left, I yield it back and hope we can go to a vote and pass this unanimously and send the kind of signal that we need to send, and that is that this country and this Congress is not going to stand for obscene material to be pushed into children's minds through the Internet without reasonable restrictions on that material. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind words. I want to return that compliment, because it has been a distinct privilege and pleasure for me to serve under the able leadership of our chairman, Senator Thurmond. Senator Thurmond is, perhaps, not one of but perhaps the most remarkable individual I have ever known, someone who has committed a lifetime and more of political service to his fellow man and to his Nation, and who has served as a Rock of Gibraltar in support of a strong national defense. Serving on the committee with his leadership has been a great privilege for me, as well as it has been with all my colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee. 
This committee of the Congress is the least partisan of all the congressional committees. We put the national defense and national security above partisanship. We work together in a team fashion. While we don't always agree across the aisle on every issue, we do find consensus. Our purpose is to protect and support our men and women in uniform, and protect the citizens of the United States by giving them the very best defense that we can purchase for their investment of tax dollars. 
This particular bill is to be commended in many ways. It addresses some of the quality of life and readiness and modernization issues that we have been struggling with. As chairman of the Airland Committee, I have had the privilege of overseeing a very considerable amount of spending that goes into modernizing our forces. We haven't been able to do everything that has been asked, but we certainly have taken important steps in trying to make sure that our defense forces are capable of meeting the threat and are unparalleled in terms of their superiority. 
As a member of the Personnel Subcommittee, as former chairman of that committee, I am pleased that we have continued to address some of the important issues of pay and housing that are necessary to maintaining the spirit and moral of the people in our force. But, we have a great deal more to do in this area. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff testified just a couple of days ago about the state of readiness for today and tomorrow. Readiness is a function of quality of life, of training, and of adequate infrastructure. Two of these three areas--the infrastructure, the housing, the equipment, the facilities, the tools which we provide our service members with, and the quality of life--are strained and in many cases inadequate. The pay is too low and military benefits are in question. We are losing good people, too many good people. A great deal needs to be done in this area. 
A great deal also needs to be done on the whole infrastructure front, not only in providing necessary facilities, but in terminating that infrastructure which is no longer needed. Too often we have perpetuated that infrastructure that is no longer required, and done so at great expense. 
I have also been engaged in the whole question of defense transformation. How can we transform our national defense from a cold-war effort that has been unparalleled in the history of national defense--not only this country, but in this world. How can we transform that into a national security apparatus our defense structure to addresses the threats of the future, which will be different from the threats of the past. That is a monumental undertaking. I have suggested a number of ways in which this could be done. I have joined with my colleagues on the committee, particularly Senator Lieberman, to define a process by which we can make those decisions, utilizing both inside and outside experts. 
We have attempted, through this process, to ask the necessary questions and to make the necessary decisions about how we move forward. In that regard, in the future some very difficult but necessary decisions and tough choices are going to have to be made about how we spend our limited defense resources. 
While we all acknowledge and hopefully will provide some additional funds to address the readiness concerns addressed by the Joint Chiefs, we are a long way from successfully allocating the resources we have available to us in the very best way that will give us the national security apparatus we need to address future threats. Tough decisions have to be made because we have the tendency to continue to fund systems that we already have in the force. Decisions are often made, both in the Pentagon and in the Congress, about maintaining what I call `legacy' systems--systems that have had a long shelf life, that are very near and dear to our heart, produced in our district, or systems we have related to over the years. There is a great tendency to perpetuate these legacy systems and not give sufficient resources and weight to the new systems that are necessary to address the new threats of the future. 
My challenge to the Congress, and my challenge to the Department of Defense, is to step up and make the unpopular choices, make the very difficult choices to divest legacy systems and structures which are no longer required, or whose value will depreciate quickly in the future, so that we can free up the resources that we must to address the question of providing the right national security apparatus that embraces the potential for a revolution in military affairs and addresses the threats of the future. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for their leadership of a truly bipartison effort which achieves an effective balance across the quality of life of our servicemembers and their families, the readiness of the force, and the modernization of our systems as we enter the 21st century. 
This accomplishment is of particular note because this defense bill adheres to the budget agreement of approximately $270 billion, a 1.1 percent decline in real terms over last year's defense budget, and it is approximately 35 percent below the cold war heights. 
This defense authorization includes numerous provisions that will enhance military quality of life. It includes a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel. It also provides an increase of $660 million in military construction projects, over $250 million of which will fund barracks, dining facilities, and military housing. And this bill directs three health care demonstrations for our military retirees who are Medicare eligible. 
This bill also adds over $800 million to the key readiness accounts of our active and reserve forces. We are all aware of the stress that current operations such as those in Bosnia or the Persian Gulf have on military readiness. The funds we have added will support infrastructure maintenance, training, and the availability of parts and supplies to sustain readiness levels. 
Despite the gains we have made in areas of quality of life and readiness, we are still well short of the $60 billion procurement goal stated by Secretary of Defense Cohen and his predecessor Secretary Perry which was to have been achieved in fiscal year 1998. 
Here we are again proposing a procurement level for fiscal year 1999 that is below $50 billion. Correspondingly, service modernization accounts remain on the margin--well short of the level required to recapitalize our joint capabilities for the 21st century. 
And now I would like to comment on several modernization issues from my perspective as chairman of the Airland Subcommittee. 
The Army is moving to consolidate the gains from the Force XXI process and to investigate smaller, faster, more lethal, and more deployable forces. But the Army's modernization strategy to pursue this transformation is lacking in areas of aviation, armored vehicles, and trucks, and we have provisions addressing these issues. 
And I must say that we have made progress in addressing reserve component modernization thanks to the fine work of Senator Glenn, the ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee, to structure a coherent process for the consideration of Guard procurement. First, the budget request included nearly $1.4 billion in procurement for the guard and reserves--about a 50 percent increase over last year. And this bill provides another several hundred million. Clearly, the Senate's bipartisan efforts are having a positive affect on total force integration. 
This bill also supports TACAIR modernization programs of the services and we have taken additional prudent steps to ensure these programs stay on track. 
Last year, I spoke at length about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and demonstrated performance. And I must acknowledge that I have these concerns as a supporter of F-22 development. But based on the testimony of the Air Force and the assessment of the General Accounting Office, there are many who share a deep concern over whether we can maintain support for the F-22, whose costs are approaching $200 million per aircraft, if the program does not adequately demonstrate performance and cost control. 
This bill takes a very important further step to put key oversight provisions in place that fence the contract award for advance procurement of lot II F-22 until: 
10 percent of testing is complete (the minimum specified by the Defense Science Board); or, the Secretary of Defense certifies that a lesser amount of flight testing is sufficient, and provides his rationale and analysis for that certification; however, the funds are fenced until the F-22 flies at least 4 percent of flight tests--the amount now planned prior to contract award--have been completed. 
This provision holds the Department to its own plan at a minimum and places the emphasis squarely on the demonstrated performance of the F-22 program. No performance, no money. 
This bill also contains a provision on a new joint experimentation initiative that is fundamental to defense transformation. 
The Congress has been keenly aware of the need to transform our military capabilities to address the potentially very different operational challenges of the future. The National Defense Panel Report argues that these challenges--which include among other things, asymmetric challenges in power projection, information operations, and weapons of mass destruction--may place this Nation's security at far greater risk than we face today. 
This provision includes a sense of Congress on the designation of a combatant commander with the mission for developing, preparing, conducting, and assessing a process of joint warfighting experimentation. Secretary Cohen has signed a charter assigning this mission to USACOM in Norfolk. And the provision lays out a set of reporting requirements from this CINC to keep Congress informed of the status of transformation. 
The process of joint experimentation is designed to investigate the co-evolution of advances in technology, with changes in the organizational structure of our forces, and the development of new operational concepts. Accordingly, the purpose of joint experimentation is to find those technologies, organizations, and concepts which provide true leap-aheads in joint warfighting capabilities. 
And just as important, it is the purpose of joint experimentation to identify those technologies and concepts which are failures. Some will consider the cost of these failures as wasteful. But quite the contrary. The true failure would be continuing to invest in systems before we really know what will or will not work on the battlefields of the 21st century. And given the level of defense budgets, we cannot afford to invest in systems which fail to contribute markedly to our future warfighting capabilities. 
Previously in our history we have found ourselves unprepared for threats we faced at the outset of war. Our Nation rallied to eventually overcome these threats, but at a cost--not only in fiscal terms, but in lives. 
In the very near future, technology will enable a different range of threats we must be prepared for. The process of joint experimentation supported in this bill will be central to ensuring our Armed Forces are prepared to successfully meet the national security challenges of the 21st century. 
This bill makes great strides in improving the quality of life, readiness, and modernization of the force; and in laying the framework for the transformation of defense capabilities for the 21st century. 
Yet there is much more work that needs to be done. The Joint Chiefs testified on Tuesday that defense budgets are not adequate to sustain current readiness and to keep our defense forces on firm footing for the future. 
But defense budgets will likely not increase to the levels requested and this will leave the Pentagon, the administration, and the Congress with some tough decisions which must be made. And we need to know what these decisions are and when they need to be made. I proposed that another quadrennial defense review and national defense panel be established in the year 2000 to conduct another comprehensive assessment of defense strategy, policy, and programs. I trust that the defense committees will work to include those provisions in next year's bill. 
I would like to thank and acknowledge the distinguished service of the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond and the distinguished ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee, Senator Glenn for their tremendous stewardship of defense issues in this Defense authorization bill. 
We often ask ourselves: `Where have the heroes gone?'. Well I know where two of them have been, and that is working side-by-side with many of us deliberating defense issues. I commend them for their service and wish them the best in all future endeavors. In closing, this bill has my full support, and I strongly encourage all Members to support it.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to rise today to speak in support of the conference report for the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. This higher education bill has been two years in the making and I know I join the rest of my colleagues in the Labor Committee, and in the Senate, in full support of this very important legislation. 
This bill represents a strong bipartisan consensus in the Congress to ensure that students maintain access to post-secondary education through vital student opportunity programs, such as TRIO; healthy, stable, and streamlined loan programs; and a simplified student aid process. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to this important bill. 
This conference report, like the underlying Senate bill, was developed with several fundamental principles. Our first, and most important theme, was to maintain the primary focus of the Higher Education Act since its inception in 1965--to ensure that students have access and opportunity to purse higher education. 
One of the most important elements of this bill aimed at ensuring student access and opportunity is the new, low interest rate for student loans. This legislation sets a student loan repayment interest rate of 7.43 percent which represents a significant reduction in the interest rate for students. The interest rate that was scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1998 would have destabilized the successful Federal Family Loan Program by causing thousands of lenders to stop making student loans, resulting in high numbers of students without student loans for this school year. The interest rate included in this conference report provides a significant reduction to students while maintaining the long-term viability of the student loan programs and ensuring that students will continue to have access to private loans at the lowest interest rate in 17 years. Depending on the size of their loan, this low interest rate will save students hundreds, even thousands, of dollars over the course of the loan. 
The conference report also offers students a low interest rate for consolidation loans. 
This conference report strengthens the major student opportunity programs in the act by focusing much needed attention and resources on these vital programs, with particular attention to the needs of low-income students. This conference report reauthorizes the Pell Grant Program at its highest level ever, with maximum grant awards at $4,500 in the 1999-2000 school year and increasing to $5,800 in the 2003-2004 academic year. This bill also makes needed reforms to the TRIO program, which helps disadvantaged children prepare for college, and increases its authorization to $700 million. 
The vital work-study programs are also continued and expanded in this conference report. The authorization for the College Work-Study Program is increased to $1 billion for fiscal year 1999 from the current funding level of $830 million. 
The need analysis formula is also revised to ensure that the growing percentage of independents students will be able to retain a greater portion of their income. 
Another critical principle for these amendments was the improvement and modernization of the student aid delivery system. This legislation creates a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) within the Department of Education aimed at providing quality service to students and parents. The utilization of this PBO which will incorporate the best and most successful practices in the private financial sector, coupled with other reforms aimed at streamlining the student aid regulatory requirements will result in a better managed and higher quality federal student aid system. 
In addition to the development of the PBO, this bill includes significant reforms to the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), and specifically to guaranty agencies. This bill restructures the guaranty agency system to ensure that these important participants in the private loan program are given the flexibility they need to help students avoid defaulting on their loans while operating in a more cost effective and efficient manner which will benefit taxpayers as well as students and their families. 
A third principle which guided these amendments was the need for much-needed reform of teacher preparation programs. I am very pleased that this bill includes a new initiative for teacher training and professional development aimed at addressing the shortage of qualified teachers in this country which replaces the existing teacher preparation programs with a single authorization for three separate grant programs. 
This initiative encourages state level reforms intended to produce well trained and highly competent teachers, local level partnerships intended to improve under-performing teacher education programs, and provides a separate grant for States and partnerships to compete for funds specifically targeted toward teacher recruitment. 
States will compete to receive 45 percent of these teacher training dollars and can use the grants to strengthen their teacher certification requirements, create or expand alternative certification programs to attract highly qualified people from other occupations to the teaching profession, to decrease the shortage of highly qualified teachers in high need areas, or to develop programs which reward excellent teachers and remove unqualified teachers. 
Partnerships will compete for 45 percent of the funds as well, while 10 percent of the funds is reserved for recruitment grants. 
This reauthorization was also guided by a strong desire to promote college cost-cutting measures, utilizing some of the recommendations of the Commission on the Cost of Higher Education which presented its findings earlier this year. This legislation includes initiatives to ensure that parents and students are kept apprised of college costs and provide with comparative data to keep colleges accountable and higher education affordable; burdensome federal regulations are reduced; and the national role in encouraging affordable higher education is strengthened. 
This bill also streamlines and consolidates the many programs and activities which are found in the Higher Education Act. This act has become increasingly complex over the years and these amendments make great strides in simplifying the act and better targeting its programs and activities. 
It has been a pleasure to be part of the development of this critical legislation. I have found the bipartisanship displayed throughout this process encouraging and I would like to thank the staff who have worked on this important legislation for the last two years: on Senator Jefford's staff, Susan Hattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, Cory Heyman, and Pam Moran have done excellent work on this bill. In addition, Marianna Pierce with Senator Kennedy and Suzanne Day with Senator Dodd have worked diligently to ensure that this bill represents a strong bipartisan consensus. Thank you all so much for your long hours and excellent work. 
Again, I am pleased to have been a part of crafting this important legislation.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I filed an amendment on this bill regarding the eligibility for new slots at Reagan National Airport. I have decided not to seek a vote on my amendment at this time. I appreciate the efforts of my colleague, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Committee, and his leadership on the FAA bill. I would like to ask if the Chairman would be willing to continue to review this issue and its merits as he takes this bill to conference.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me first say thanks to my colleagues from Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Ohio, and others who have so persuasively and so relentlessly pursued the truth of this issue and brought us to this point where we have to have an honest, open debate and a vote about where we stand on what I believe is the most important issue facing America. 
We do have fundamental disagreement over the subject of abortion. Strong convictions have often led to strident rhetoric. Sometimes labels and name-calling are too easily substituted for persuasion. Education is a means of winning the hearts and minds of our fellow citizens. `Extremism' and `fanaticism' have been labels that have been used and attached to those with deeply held beliefs. 
Yet as civil as our discourse needs to be, sometimes there are issues that are of such weight and such gravity that strong rhetoric is necessary, when the truth--raw and exposed--merits passion and rhetoric. This is such a case. There really is only one issue at stake here. That issue is that what we are confronting is an affront to humanity. It is an affront to justice to end the life of a kicking infant as it emerges from its mother's womb. 
That is at issue here. The legislation that the President has vetoed is not the expression of extremism. The expression of extremism is the procedure we are debating--extreme in its violence and disregard for human life and dignity. We have heard a description of that. I was going to give that, but I will defer on the description because it has been given by my colleague from New Hampshire. The opposition has used arguments to defend this procedure that I believe are evasive and misrepresent the truth. 
It is said that the procedure is rare and, therefore, we ought not to be discussing it. Despite the fact that the procedure is not rare and affects thousands of individuals--children--would we be passing on the debate, the fundamental issue of life itself, if we were talking about the Holocaust because somebody was saying we are not talking about very many people? It is just a few hundred or a few thousand. Does that make the debate or issue any different? 
The issue is not whether it is rare; the issue is, as a matter of undeniable, unalienable human rights, it should not only be rare, this procedure should be nonexistent. 
It is said that the child feels nothing. We now know that the child feels pain, that a mother's anesthesia does not eliminate her child's pain. We know that a child killed in this procedure feels exactly what a preemie would feel if a doctor performed a similar procedure in the nursery. 
It is said that the procedure is done to save the life of the mother. We know that is not true. We also know that this procedure has significant risks for the mother. In fact, the primary purpose of this procedure is for the convenience of the abortionist. 
It is said that the partial-birth abortion is part of the mainstream of medicine. But we know that the AMA Council on Legislation stated that this practice is not a `recognized medical technique,' and that this `procedure is basically repulsive.' Those are not the words of this Senator. Those are not the words of those of us in the political arena. Those are the words of the AMA Council. 
So when we strip away all the arguments, we are left with an uncomfortable truth: This procedure is not the practice of medicine; it is an act of violence, an almost unspeakable act of violence--the taking of an innocent life, a life fully capable of being self-sustaining. 
Mr. President, it is hard to clearly confront the reality of this matter because clarity requires such anguish. But that reality is simple and terrible. The reality is that the death of a child should haunt us and shame us as a society. It should cause us to grieve. But more than that, it should cause us to turn our backs on this practice, as my colleague from New York has said, which borders on infanticide, and which I believe is infanticide. 
It is hard for me to believe that such a statement, such a debate, should be necessary. It is hard for me to understand how a moral commitment so basic could ever be debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Has our compassion grown so selective? Has our moral sense grown so dull? Have our hearts grown so hard? 
This is not just another skirmish in the running debate between left and right. It raises the most basic of questions asked in any democracy: Who is my neighbor? Who is my brother? Who do I define as inferior and cast beyond sympathy and 
protection? Who do I embrace and value, in both law and love? 
This is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of humanity. This is not just a matter of our Nation's politics; it is a matter of our Nation's soul. It is a matter of how we will be judged as a nation, not only by history, but by Almighty God. 
We have disagreed in this body in matters of social policy. Yet, surely, we can come together and agree on this one thing--that an unborn child should not be subjected to violence and death. I believe personally that that protection should be applied and extended to all of the unborn. That is a debate that we must have, but that is not the debate today. The debate today is over this particular procedure. At the very least, regardless of our view and position of how far this ought to extend, to all of humanity and all of creation, can we not at least today reject the extinction of a child's life just seconds before it is born and fully leaves the womb? Can we not at least refuse to cross this line? 
Mr. President, the vote today is an opportunity for us to take a different path. It is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and it is an opportunity even for those who support abortion and take the pro-choice position, to override the President's veto. We can begin today to define some common ground. We can begin today by saying every child in America will be embraced by our community, that no one is expendable, no one will be turned away. We can begin today to define a basic value, a basic common ground, because if we pass this legislation over the President's objection, it will mean that we will, once again, in this great experiment in democracy, extend the circle of protection and expand it one more time. This is the test of a just civilization, and this is the standard by which we, individually and as a nation, will be tested as well. 
If we defeat this measure, we will say something about this great American experiment and the limits that we place on its promise. Our founders raised the standard for the ages that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. It is true that the laws they lived by, even the Constitution they wrote, stood in tension with that transcendent ideal. But the standard remained and has sustained the hopes of the weak throughout the history of this country. 
The history of our Nation is a story of how the hopes of the weak have been advanced, our progress toward the ideals of the declaration has been bought with blood, demanded with eloquence, and written into our law in some historic debates in this Chamber and elsewhere. 
Mr. President, one by one, the powerless have been embraced and the American family has been extended--to African Americans, women, the disabled. Each have redeemed a promissory note, given at our founding. Each victory of compassion and justice has been a landmark of liberty. Over time, justice has prevailed. 
Abraham Lincoln wrote of our founders:  
This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble understanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures. . . . In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on. . . . They grasped not only the whole race of man then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their children, and their children, and the countless myriads who would inhabit the Earth in other ages. 
Does that beacon still shine throughout the world? Does the light of that path of nations, where freedom is new, shine? And what is the example that we set? 
It is my deepest concern, my nightmare fear that we will extinguish that light, that we will halt the progress of America's promise, and we will cast one class of the powerless into the darkness beyond our protection. 
Lincoln talked of America as a nation dedicated to a proposition embodied in the declaration, but can the weakest member of the human family find a humble share in the promise of our founding? Will we say, after centuries of struggle, that the gate of mercy is now slammed shut, locked and the key thrown away? 
These are the questions that put the American experiment to the test. Let us affirm the words of the Great Emancipator that nothing, nothing stamped with a divine image and likeness is denied the right to participate in this noble experiment called democracy. Let us not fail in this test that is now put before us. 
Mr. President, it appears my time has expired. I thank, again, the Senator from Pennsylvania for his outstanding leadership on this issue.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support to the Government of the Republic of Macedonia which on September 8th celebrated seven years of independence. 
Many of us are encouraged with the activities the Government has enacted with respect to democracy, human rights and international peace. 
Although a small nation of approximately two million people and the size of Vermont, the Republic of Macedonia, located in the very unstable region of the Balkans, has established itself as an example of peaceful, constructive, good neighborly country and our reliable ally. 
The Republic of Macedonia is the only country that, following the dissolution of former Yugoslavia in 1991, gained independence in a peaceful and legitimate manner, by a way of a referendum and a new Constitution, refusing to take part in the war that was waged in the other parts of former Yugoslavia, thus showing that at the threshold of the 21st century, it is possible to become independent without bloodshed. 
Not only did the Republic of Macedonia opt against policies of territorial aspirations, forceful changing of borders and ethnic cleansing, but also made it very clear that such policies are the cause for conflicts and wars in the ethnically intermixed Balkans. 
Over the seven years of its independence, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has instituted a series of economic reforms to control inflation, reduce debt, increase exports and foster growth. 
Recently, many American investors have started to see South-Eastern Europe as an economic area of large potential with more than 60 million people, and the Republic of Macedonia as the most strategically located in the center of this large market. 
The United States must continue its support for the Republic of Macedonia, especially having in mind the recent developments in neighboring Yugoslavia.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enzi amendment. It is quite simple, but I would like to briefly restate the effect of the amendment in order to frame my remarks. The amendment would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from promulgating new regulations empowering the Secretary to approve class III gambling activities without State approval. 
Mr. President, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in the Seminole of Florida versus the State of Florida, and subsequent activities by the Secretary of the Interior, we are confronted with a situation where an unelected federal official, using the rulemaking process, is seeking to empower himself with the ability to supersede the authority of the popularly elected State government, and to impose Indian gambling activity on an unwilling State. 
Mr. President, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act attempted to construct a delicate balance, the intent of which was to provide a definitive role for the States in determining whether to allow the introduction of new gambling activities. The Court's ruling has upset this balance. 
During debate over the fiscal year 1998 funding measure, a similar measure to the one we are debating today was adopted. It was adopted with the understanding that congressional action was needed in order to address this concern, as well as others, with IGRA. However, no action has yet been taken. And thus, we have the need to extend this moratorium. 
Now, what does all of this mean to the individual States? The distinguished Senator from Wyoming has already placed into the Record the various letters of support from the nation's governors, and states attorneys general. I will let that support speak for itself. I would like to relate the experience of the State of Indiana. 
I have here an article from the Indianapolis Star. The article documents the latest development in a struggle that has been on-going in Northern Indiana for several years now. The article begins: `Potawatomi tribe buys land near Indiana town; A reservation would be OK, resident says, but many fear a casino would eventually follow.' 
The article goes on to describe that; `The Pokagon Band of the Potawatomi Indians acquired land in Indiana, the first step toward establishing a reservation and casino in the State.' A spokesperson for the tribe points out in this article that they intend to do many important things with the land they have purchased; provide housing, schools, and a health clinic. However, she goes on to point out that a land-based casino in Indiana is among the tribe's eventual goals. 
The Pokagons have been attempting for several years now to purchase land in the area. However, they have met with significant resistance from local landowners and community leaders for fear that casinos would follow any land sale. In fact, over the past 2 years, the town counsel of North Liberty, the town adjacent to the land purchase, has unanimously passed two resolutions in opposition to casino gambling. Further, the Governor of Indiana has announced his opposition to Indian gambling amid public outcries against the proposition. 
Yet, Mr. President, under the rules proposed by the Secretary, the will of the people of North Liberty, of the elected representatives of the State of Indiana, would be laid to waste by an unelected federal official. By any interpretation of IGRA, this was not the intention of Congress in passing the law. 
The gambling industry is booming. In 1988, only two states (Nevada and New Jersey) permitted casino gambling. By 1994, 23 states had legalized gambling. During this time, casino gambling revenue nearly doubled. In 1993, $400 billion was spent on all forms of legal gambling in America Between 1992 and 1994, the gambling industry enjoyed an incredible 15 percent annual growth in revenues. 
Many of my colleagues would look at this performance and say `good for them.' Many would cite the gambling industry as an American success story. I am not so enthusiastic. There are many unanswered questions regarding the hidden costs of rolling out the welcome mat for the gambling industry. Many of the promises made by the gambling industry--of jobs, economic growth, and increased tax revenues--are dubious at best. The statistics on the devastating impact on our families are beginning to roll in. Concern about teenage gambling addiction is growing as more and more teens are lured by the promise of easy money. Crime and suicide numbers are sky-rocketing in communities where gambling has taken root. 
The National Gambling Impact Study Commission is currently studying this issue. By passing this resolution, we will create the necessary time to modify IGRA to ensure the law is clear in protecting the rights of the individual states. It will allow the states to determine how and when gambling operations will begin or expand within their borders, and to look to the report to the Gambling Commission for help in making those decisions. 
I commend the efforts of the Senators from Wyoming and Alabama in bringing this issue before the Senate, and urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Ashcroft's amendment. I have thought long and hard about this issue. We have debated it a number of times in committee and on the floor. I have come to the conclusion that the Senator's amendment is a correct amendment. It is correct because in so many ways this agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, has shown itself as not responsive to the Congress and not responsive to the American people. This is, in many ways, a difficult position for me to take because I have long been a supporter of the central mission of the NEA. A number of beneficial grants have been given to institutions in Indiana, and projects have been promoted that I do believe serve a public interest. 
I don't dispute the fact that knowledge and beauty are among some of the highest calls of any culture. But sadly, that has not been the debate of the last few years. We are not discussing the role of the arts in our society. There will always be a prominent role for art and culture in our society. What we are discussing here is the role of public subsidy of that art, and the question of whether or not we should appropriate tax dollars from our constituents to fund these types of projects, particularly when it seems that year after year that funding raises questions and controversy. 
Whenever we seem to revisit this matter, we return to one central question: Do we in Congress have the right to take money from citizens and allow it to be used in ways that, for many, go against some of their most deeply held religious and moral beliefs? 
Over the last several years, several Members have been trying to ensure that Federal dollars are not used in ways that offend a majority of Americans. The Senator from North Carolina has tried to stop support for the most offensive projects by restricting the ability of the National Endowment for the Arts to fund projects which defile or offend people's religious beliefs, and projects which depict the body in degrading and offensive ways. This effort to limit objectionable projects by holding all grants to a decency standard was a fiscally and, I believe, morally responsible position, one that was supported, happily, by a majority of the Senate. I was pleased to see that the decency standard was upheld by the Supreme Court this past June by a very substantial vote of 8-1. 
Mr. President, the Senate should not have a role as art 
critic, and certainly not a role as censor. But it does have, as its primary and defining purpose, the role of determining if public funds are spent in the public interest. 
I started out these comments by expressing my support for the central mission of the promotion of the arts and my appreciation for the grants that have been made to different projects in Indiana--worthy grants. However, in spite of this, I remain convinced that, during the last three decades in particular, the National Endowment for the Arts has failed in its mission to enhance cultural life in the United States. It has brought controversy to the whole area. Despite numerous attempts to reform it, the NEA attempts to support what I think are often politically correct but patently offensive projects. I don't think we can ignore this. 
I think the central question is whether or not this is the best use of the taxpayers' dollars. There are alternatives. I have supported and voted for efforts to privatize this whole function. I have supported and voted for efforts to block grant these funds to State councils, which I think are much more responsive and responsible in terms of how they are distributed. I have looked for alternative ways of providing incentives to support some of these very valuable contributions that are made through various projects that exist in our States. But I have been discouraged time after time in terms of our ability here to rein in what I think is often an inappropriate use of these taxpayers' dollars. For that reason, I support the amendment being offered by the Senator from Missouri and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of S. 1645, The Child Custody Protection Act. 
The purpose of this act is to prohibit the transportation of minors across state lines with intent to avoid application of a state law requiring parental involvement in a minor obtaining an elective abortion. 
As I imagine the fear, confusion, and perceived isolation of a minor child who learns that she is pregnant, I can think of few situations where the support and security of family is more desperately needed. Many states have enacted laws to assure that parents are involved. This bill would assure that these state laws are not easily circumvented by crossing state lines. 
There is an even more sobering aspect to this issue. A significant reason behind evasion of the State's parental involvement law can be an effort to cover up statutory rape violations. 
In a study of 46,000 pregnancies by school-age girls in California, researchers found that seventy-one percent, or over 33,000, were fathered by adult post-high-school men. Another study reports that 58 percent of the time it is the girl's boyfriend who accompanies a girl for an abortion when her parents have not been informed of the pregnancy. 
Obviously, many of these men are vulnerable to statutory rape charges. This vulnerability provides these men with a strong incentive to pressure the much younger girl to agree to an abortion without revealing the pregnancy to the parents. Currently, a man seeking to do so can evade the law and hide his crime by driving his victim across State lines. 
Opponents of this legislation argue that in some families, ideal relationship may not exist with the parents--that in families where abuse is present, for example, parental involvement would be detrimental. This concern is addressed in that judicial bypass provisions exist in every state with a parental notification requirement. These judicial bypass procedures are not onerous. A recent study of Massachusetts bypass procedure published in the American Journal of Public Health reported that only 1 out of 477 girls was refused a judicial authorization. Furthermore, the average hearing lasted less than 13 minutes. 
Passing this bill will not force parental disclosure in instances where abuse exists within a family. Conversely, failure to pass this legislation could compromise parental support from the majority of families where good counsel and loving support would be provided. 
Americans support the concept of parental involvement. In a 1996 Gallup poll seventy-six percent of those polled favored laws requiring the girls under the age of 18 get either parental consent or at least inform their parents before obtaining an abortion. This conviction is reflected at a legislative level by the 22 states that have enacted laws requiring parental notification. 
This is not a broad piece of legislation, it has in fact been described by the media as `narrowly tailored to address a specific problem.' The act does not establish a national requirement of parental consent or notification prior to the performance of an abortion on a minor under 18. Nor does it attempt to regulate any purely intrastate activities related to the procurement of abortion services. S. 1645 simply helps effectuate the policies of States that have decided to provide a layer of protection of their own residents against these dangers to children's health and safety by requiring parental involvement in the abortion decision. 
Minors must not be left alone to make these crucial decisions. Abortion is a major medical procedure, highly invasive and often emotionally traumatic. There are hundreds of accounts of women who as adults, decide to undergo an elective abortion and are then plagued by profound regret, health complications and emotional trauma for having made that decision. 
How much greater is the potential for a hasty and regrettable decision when the mother is herself a child who may not fully understand her options and the consequences of her choices? 
I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture to proceed to this bill and to support this important legislation, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I know Members are anxious to get to this cloture vote. I strongly support the efforts of the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Pennsylvania and others to deal with this important item. I commend them for their perseverance in pursuing this. I think it is important that we move forward with this and support it. 
It is designed in a way to protect the rights of children, the rights of parents, and the rights of States. I urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Richard G. Lugar and myself, I am pleased to offer this tribute to Captain Ritch K. Eich, United States Naval Reserve. Captain Eich retires in September after 30 years as a reservist, the last three of which he spent on active duty, representing the Navy in the Office of the Adjutant General of the Indiana National Guard. 
Ritch Eich has been a valued member of the Indiana team since 1989, when he started work for me as a member of my Service Academy Selection Committee, screening and recommending promising Hoosier high school students as candidates for our nation's Service Academies. Three years ago, he took on the additional responsibility of serving as the U.S. Navy's Liaison Officer for the State of Indiana, working in the office of Indiana's Adjutant General. During that time, Ritch made substantial contributions to readiness planning in Indiana. He completed Disaster Preparedness Operations Plans for Indiana Naval, Marine Corps and Coast Guard facilities, and ensured a close working relationship between the Indiana National Guard and the State Emergency Management Office. 
Ritch Eich's civilian job during this period was as the chief marketing, public affairs and physician relations officer for Indiana University Medical Center, where--over the course of a decade--he has helped to build a vibrant and effective health care environment for Hoosiers. According to one health care executive, Ritch had helped `define our vision, map our strategies, deliver on our promises and guide our affiliations.' And for Rich, `helping Hoosiers access the best healthcare in the mid-west' was what it was all about. 
In all his endeavors, Ritch Eich has demonstrated a skill and dedication that reflect great credit upon himself, the State of Indiana and the United States Navy. I feel privileged to offer this tribute to Ritch on the occasion of his retirement from the Naval Reserves. We wish him well.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, as always, are thoughtful, articulate, and in this case somber and serious, given the gravity of the situation that he described. They are important remarks and important for each of us in this body to thoughtfully and seriously consider. 
The Senator's commitment, as a valued member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and ex-chairman of that committee--his commitment to traveling to where the action is taking place and meeting with representatives from all sides, analyzing the problem and bringing back the very latest of information, is invaluable to those of us who serve on that committee and everyone here in this body who needs to make decisions about what the policy of the United States should be in regard to these difficult situations that arise. 
The Senator has indicated he has made close to 10 separate trips to this very difficult area of the world. This is not easy travel. This is a commitment that is extraordinary but also extraordinarily important to us in terms of formulating our policy. I thank the Senator for his leadership in that effort.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know the pending business is the Hutchison amendment and my modification to that. I know that the managers are anxious to move forward. 
Just before I do that, I would like to add briefly my thoughts to those that have already been expressed for perhaps the most remarkable individual I have ever met. 
I too am privileged, like the rest of us, to have served in this body as an associate and colleague of Strom Thurmond. I was 5 years old when Strom Thurmond ran for President. I learned about him in studying history and government in school. I never dreamed that I would have the opportunity to know the man personally and to be a colleague of his and serve with him. 
Much has been said that I heartily agree with about the stature of this man, the remarkable career that he has had and is having, and his remarkable service to the people of South Carolina and to our Nation. 
I am one of those who share with the Senator from Delaware the pleasure and surprise of a phone call from Strom Thurmond on the day of my daughter's wedding apologizing for not being there, congratulating me and congratulating her. I, like Senator Biden, hadn't a clue as to how he found out my daughter was being married. I never mentioned it to him. But there he was. 
I had the pleasure of coaching young Paul Thurmond in youth league basketball on Saturday mornings as our boys, my son and Strom's son, would run up and down the floor. We won the championship, by the way, thanks to the great athletic ability and talent of Paul. As they would run up and down the floor, I only had to turn around just a little bit, because two rows behind the coaching bench was Paul's father, Strom Thurmond, cheering on his son. 
Each of us could stand here and tell stories, I think, until deep in the night about the impact that this individual has had on each of us and the impact that he has had on this Senate. 
Strom is an inspiration. 
Bob Dole has said over and over, `I just order whatever Strom orders. Whatever he is eating must be the right thing.' 
Strom has detailed for me his physical exercise regimen, which is something that I can't keep up with. I don't know how he does it, but he does. I have been the recipient of his handshake, as Senator Wellstone has, and I walk away rubbing my hand in awe and respect for the strength of this individual. 
Finally, I have sat with him shoulder to shoulder on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and a deeper patriot, a more committed American, someone with a more remarkable story of a lifetime of service to the military of this Nation I don't think has ever lived. Someone who flew in a glider in the invasion of Normandy, served as a distinguished officer in the military, and then served as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as he now does--that is a story that is not going to be repeated. That is a story that is not going to be duplicated. God only makes one of each of us. But he made Strom Thurmond a very, very, very special human being. 
It has been a deep honor and a deep privilege of mine to have known him, to be counted as his friend, to have served with him. It is a memory that I will cherish for as long as I live. 
Mr. President, unless there are others who seek to add to these statements in honor and recognition of Senator Thurmond, I will proffer my modification. However, I will yield to the Senator from Texas. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have a modification to the Hutchison amendment I would like to send to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly explain to my colleagues what I have attempted to do. 
Yesterday, I sent to the desk an amendment which would have transferred the $35 million that is appropriated in the foreign operations appropriations bill that is before us now, and reallocated that money from the currently earmarked Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization to the antiterrorist portion of funding contained within this bill. I did so because of the disturbing news that have been reported on by the New York Times and other organizations relative to violations, apparent violations of the agreement that we entered into with North Korea to freeze their nuclear development program. 
The New York Times--and I will recount some of that in a moment--pointed out that U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a huge, secret, underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear weapons program. 
Members will remember that in return for a freeze on that program, the United States entered into an agreement with North Korea to provide certain items for humanitarian assistance, food aid, oil for energy production, as well as a commitment to put together a consortium which would build two light-water nuclear reactors to supply energy, but that could not be used for the purpose of developing material which might be used for weapons of mass destruction. 
The Times report cites a senior administration official saying, and I quote: 
`The North had not yet technically violated the Agreed Framework because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant . . .' Nevertheless, an unidentified official has said it is a serious development, to say nothing of it is an incredibly stupid move, because it endangers both the nuclear accord and humanitarian aid to North Korea. 
The Washington Post stated that the site that was discovered is huge, that some 15,000 reported North Koreans are at work on this underground cavern, and this comes only 6 months after the President of the United States has certified that North Korea is complying with the provisions of the Agreed Framework. That certification is what is necessary in order for these funds to be released. 
My amendment sought to take a portion of those funds, transfer it to the antiterrorism section of this bill in recognition of the fact that this Presidential certification was no longer relevant, now that the agreement had been violated. 
I am willing to withdraw that amendment in light of the fact that Senator McCain has offered an amendment adding language to the certification process so that the President, in addition to other items that he has to certify, will have to certify that North Korea is not engaged in a violation of the agreement. The exact wording is `pursuing the acquisition or development of nuclear capability other than the light-water reactors' referred to in the agreement. 
I would have voted against the McCain amendment, or for the motion to table had we not been able to work out language which I could now add to the amendment of the Senator from Texas which would add further conditions to this certification. The bottom line is, I think the certification has turned into an empty process. It is a process by which the so-called host country, in this case North Korea, essentially tells us everything is OK, and then we, on the basis of that, go ahead and certify. The term `certification' is not defined, but yet if we look at the use of the term that is used in the agreement that we have with the People's Republic of China regarding nuclear nonproliferation, it simply says that the President certifies to the Congress that the Republic of China has provided clear and convincing evidence that they are in compliance with the agreement. And so the burden of proof is on the country which we are trying to determine whether or not they have violated the agreement, rather than on our ability to verify the fact that they have or have not complied with the agreement. 
President Reagan used to say trust but verify. Well, this is trust but not verify. 
And so what I am attempting to do with this modification, which goes to an amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, is to say that not less than 45 days prior to the President's certification as provided for in this bill, the Director of Central Intelligence will provide for review and consideration by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House International Relations Committee, House National Security Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senate Appropriations Committee as well as the Senate Armed Services Committee, all relevant information bearing on North Korea's compliance with the provisions of this amendment. 
That gives us the opportunity in Congress to determine whether or not the certification is a legitimate certification. That gives us the information to determine whether or not North Korea is in full compliance with what they agreed to do. So I think this language is important. 
One last thing. I am withdrawing my amendment, partly because I believe the other body will take action on some deferral of this money and that this item can be handled in conference. It is clear that without that assurance we may get bogged down here in this process, and I don't want to hold up this appropriation. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for agreeing to this modification. I particularly thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me to make this modification to her amendment, which will then become part of the bill. 
I think this is a serious problem. If the New York Times report is substantiated, if it is correct, even remotely correct, it is a clear and direct violation of the promise and agreement made by North Korea to freeze its nuclear development capabilities. If that is the case, it is clear that this is a breach of promise which requires very serious reaction and response by the United States. 
The President of the United States and the Secretary of State have certified to us directly that there are no violations. Yet, we now receive this particular information. I have quotes here from the President of the United States and from the Secretary of State which have led us to believe that everything is in compliance. Yet, we now receive this report. So it is the credibility of the certification process that is at stake here, and I would say it is the credibility of this administration in evaluating the intelligence. Therefore, it is necessary that, at the very least, the Congress have access to all relevant intelligence regarding this particular agreement so in the future we can verify it, in addition to the trust that is placed by this administration on the word of North Korea. 
Mr. President, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on Appropriations on March 4, 1998, Secretary Albright stated:  
Our request this year includes $35 million for the Korean Energy Development Organization. The Agreed Framework has succeeded in freezing North Korea's dangerous nuclear program. 
On May 8, 1998, James Foley, Department of State said: 
We, of course, closely monitor the Agreed Framework. We are, until now, satisfied that the DPRK has indeed met its obligations to the present. 
On May 13, 1998, Jamie Rubin said: 
We are confident that North Korea has not violated the across-the-board freeze on its nuclear activities . . . and the Agreed Framework is alive and well. 
On July 8, 1998, Secretary Albright testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that: 
The People's Republic of China has consistently supported the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. . . . 
On July 19, 1998, Jamie Rubin, Department of State, responding to a GAO report alleging North Korea was blocking inspections at sites covered by the Agreed Framework said: 
We have frozen and stopped the North Korean nuclear program from moving in a direction that would have threatened the world. The freeze is still being monitored and we believe it is still in effect. 
Less than 1 month later on August 17, 1998, the New York Times broke the following story: 
U.S. Intelligence Agencies have detected a huge secret underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear weapons program, according to officials who have been briefed on the intelligence information. 
The finding also follows a string of provocations by the north, including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion of a small North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off the South Korean coast this year. 
And what was the administration's reaction? According to the same New York Times article: 
A senior administration official said the north had not yet technically violated . . . the Agreed Framework, because there is no evidence that Pyongy Ang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or reprocessing plant. . . . 
The article continues: 
But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge work site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center, where, until the 1994 accord, the north is believed to have created enough plutonium to build six or more bombs. Thousands of North Korean workers are swarming around the new site, burrowing into the mountainside, American officials said. 
And if that is not enough, Monday's test flight of the Taepo Dong-1 over Japan demonstrates that North Korea has mastered the technology of delivering a nuclear warhead. Yesterday's New York Times reported the following: 
Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin project on nuclear arms control . . . said the missile test was `a clear sign' of North Korea's intent to develop nuclear weapons, despite its 1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for western assistance. Milhollin said a two-stage missile was too costly to construct simply for delivering conventional weapons. `It means they plan to put a nuclear warhead on it or export it to somebody who will,' he said. `The missile makes no sense otherwise.' 
In short, this administration has negotiated an accord in 1994 that we cannot and do not even attempt to monitor and verify. As we have just been reminded this week by the resignation of a key U.S. arms inspector in Iraq, William Ritter, `The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms control at all.' 
Yet that is precisely where we are left. An illusion that the administration refuses to define as such. Certifications that are meaningless. Ronald Reagan reminded us to `trust, but verify.' The North Koreans insist by their reluctance to admit inspectors that we will not verify as a basic term of the agreement. So we are left simply with trust. Trust the North Korean regime which has just launched long range missiles over our allies. Trust of the administration. Trust that has been frivolously squandered and badly eroded. 
Again, I thank the participants in this for accepting this modification of the amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to speak on a broader subject. I want to take a few moments to discuss what has been a dramatic change in administration policy regarding the war on terrorism. According to the administration's chronology of Osama bin Laden's terrorist attacks against U.S. facilities or U.S. citizens, this individual is connected in one way or another to a series of disturbing terrorist incidents. This chronology, by the way, was offered by our National Security Advisor, Mr. Berger. I am taking this from that chronology of terrorist incidents. He has conspired to kill U.S. servicemen in Yemen in 1992. He plotted the deaths of American and other peacekeepers in Somalia in 1993. He assisted Egyptian terrorists who tried to assassinate Egyptian President Mubarak in 1995. He conducted a car bombing against the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan in 1995. He plotted to blow up U.S. airliners in the Pacific and separately conspired to kill the Pope. He bombed a joint U.S. and Saudi military training mission in Riyadh in 1995. He issued a declaration of war against the United States in August of 1996. He stated, `If someone can kill an American soldier, it is better than wasting time on other matters.' In February of this year, Osama bin Laden stated, he declared his intention to attack--his network--their intention to attack Americans and our allies, including citizens, civilians, anywhere in the world. And as we all know, last month he has been directly linked to the bombing of U.S. Embassies in Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi. 
Two weeks after this latest tragic incident, the U.S. launched a missile strike against one of bin Laden's facilities in Afghanistan, as well as against a Sudanese facility, which received initial financing from a bin Laden enterprise. 
I, along with most Americans, welcome this administration's change in policy as a necessary and long overdue response. However, it is not to say that there weren't legitimate questions raised concerning the timing of this attack--I was one of those who raised such questions--and the timing of this policy change, coming as it did during the President's personal crisis. I was concerned that this sea change, this dramatic change in policy, might be misunderstood or misinterpreted by both allies and foes alike, thereby damaging and undermining the credibility of this administration's newly declared policy against terrorism. 
Make no mistake, Mr. President, it is appropriate to respond whenever innocent Americans are attacked in acts of political terrorism. The alternative serves only to encourage those who seek to do us harm in pursuit of their private agendas. I caution, however, that we must also be certain of our targets and political objectives, and careful to make sure that our response is to reinforce and not undermine our policies. 
Clearly, the U.S. strike and the administration's characterization of it as a `war on terrorism' is a notable departure from the policies and actions of the past several years. Rightly or wrongly, the Khobar Towers incident stands out as an example of U.S. inaction in the face of recent terrorist attacks. 
Certainly the Khobar Towers investigation has been delayed and complicated by the need for close cooperation with the Saudi Government. But the current White House crisis raises serious doubts for our allies and gives fuel to our adversaries whose focus is likely to be the difference in the U.S. response to the deaths of American military personnel at Khobar and those in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. There may very well be justification for the difference in response, but it clearly signals a change in policy and, for many of us, a welcome change in policy. 
More worrisome is that this newfound inclination to military action against terrorist organizations bears no resemblance whatsoever to the administration's so-called foreign policy priorities concerning rogue nations, such as Iraq and North Korea. 
On February 17, 1998, President Clinton addressed the Nation. He said, `. . .this is not a time free from peril, especially as a result of reckless acts of outlaw nations and an unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers and organized international 
criminals * * * and they will be all the more lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. We simply cannot allow that to happen. There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of his people, stability of his region and the safety of all the rest of us.' 
Yet, Mr. President, in the last few months, this administration has made what many see as a mockery of the inspection regime in Iraq, has failed to respond to the intelligence of an active nuclear program in North Korea, and has clearly allowed the North Koreans to continue to build a delivery system which will be capable of reaching the United States in its next phase of development. 
The President himself said last February that `we have no business agreeing to any resolution of [the Iraqi crisis] that does not include free, unfettered access to the remaining sites by people who have integrity and proven competence in the inspection business.' 
This is a critical statement, one which I think bears repeating. 
The President himself said last February that `we'--meaning the United States--`have no business agreeing to any resolution of [the Iraqi crisis] that does not include free, unfettered access to the remaining sites by people who have integrity and proven competence in the inspection business.' 
Yet, just last week, the lead inspector of the United States resigned in disgust at the pressure the Clinton administration has brought to bear to explicitly undercut the very inspection regime which the President said we have no business in changing. In his resignation letter, Scott Ritter, that inspector--someone who does have proven integrity and proven competence in the inspection business--said this:  
Iraq has lied to the special commission and the world since day one concerning the true scope and nature of its proscribed programs and weapons systems. This lie has been perpetuated over the years through systematic acts of concealment. . . . the commission has uncovered indisputable proof of a systematic concealment mechanism, run by the President of Iraq, and protected by the Presidential security forces. . . . 
The current decision by the Security Council and the Secretary General, backed at least implicitly by the United States, to seek a diplomatic alternative to inspection-driven confrontation with Iraq, a decision which constitutes a surrender to the Iraqi leadership . . . has succeeded in thwarting the stated will of the United Nations. 
The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms control at all. What is being propagated by the Security Council today in relation to the work of the special commission is such an illusion, one which in all good faith I cannot, and will not, be a party to. I have no other option than to resign from my position here at the commission effective immediately. 
That is a strong statement, Mr. President. It is a strong statement made by one who has a reputation for impeccable integrity and for total competence in the inspection business. Yet, he believed that his ability to carry out his assigned duties and his mission was undermined by the United Nations Security Council, with the implicit support of the U.S. Government, and he felt that the only course of action he had was to resign. 
Clearly, last month's strikes are a substantial change from the administration's largely restrained reactions to previous terrorist attacks on Americans. To be fair, circumstances and the need to cooperate with foreign governments were behind some of that earlier reticence. 
The President said: We must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we can. 
There is no question that we will face attempts at reprisal over years and years. This is something that seems all the more certain given the reports that bin Laden has offered bounties for terrorist actions resulting in the deaths of Americans. So we, indeed, must be prepared to act for as long as we must. 
But we must recognize that in our endeavor to defeat terrorists, perhaps to a greater extent than ever before, our success will depend upon the ability to gather friends and allies together in a common struggle against this common enemy. Trust is the essential element in this equation. So it is imperative that the President of the United States be capable of establishing and maintaining the level of trust necessary to execute a successful policy against terrorism. 
At the same time, we will need to increase our readiness to defend against the wide range of potential attacks on our citizens and interests as well as those of our friends and allies anywhere in the world. 
Our planning and strategy must be sustainable over the long run. We need to find cheaper and more effective methods to attack terrorist infrastructures and planning. It seems woefully obvious that the use of costly weapons and defensive measures will have to be restricted to correspondingly grievous affects. Osama bin Laden unquestionably presents a significant and demonstrated threat to U.S. interests. But surely nations such as Iraq and North Korea represent a substantially greater magnitude of threat to our vital national interests. Moreover, these nations have demonstrated an intent to develop, and in the case of Iraq employ, weapons of mass destruction. Worse yet, these states seem willing to transfer such technology to other nations or groups who intend to use it against the United States and our allies. 
Secretary Albright declared that `the risk that leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.' 
That statement does not square with the allocation of national security resources to operations in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. It may be that these latter operations should enjoy some measure of emphasis. But, lacking a coherent foreign policy and corresponding national security strategy, it is difficult to judge and even more difficult to trust the rationale we are giving for our involvement in these operations. 
If leaders of these rogue states--Iraq and Korea--do pose, as Secretary Albright has said, the greatest security threat that we and our allies face, then we must ask legitimate questions about the deployment of our security resources and national security assets in places of lesser importance, unless, of course, we are willing to support both in a measure necessary to be prepared and to accomplish both objectives at the same time. 
Mr. President, let's take this new-found determination to combat terrorism, as declared by the President, at face value. In doing so, it is important, then, that the call to action must be more than mere rhetoric. It is important that the President articulate his policy and according strategy as well as initiate development of the capabilities that will be needed to affect that strategy. The current upside-down priorities wherein all too limited U.S. defense resources are spent on what are surely less critical operations in Bosnia and elsewhere need to be examined to reflect the serious threat to U.S. national interests that terrorism comprises, whether by rogue nations, states-sponsored groups, or actions of independents like bin Laden. 
Yet the question remains: What are the Nation's capabilities to execute this administration's change in foreign policy about 
terrorism? What has been done to enhance the interagency process to address the transnational threat of terrorism? Has the administration developed the intelligence capabilities and the military capabilities to support this policy? 
Some of our friends and allies rightly express the concern that the Clinton administration has not addressed some of these key issues, and that, therefore, when the United States starts to find out how hard and how expensive it is to pursue a long-term effort against terrorism, we will lose resolve and not sustain our efforts. 
Many of us fear that the administration will merely add the military tasks associated with counterterrorism to the Pentagon's already stretched list of missions, and will do so without providing the additional funding required. In short, we will throw yet another rock in the military's already overflowing rucksack and expect them to shoulder the burden with the same budget and the same forces. 
We must recognize the risk of pursuing such an approach with our military, a military that is currently ill-matched to this threat. Military budgets and force structure are down 35 percent to 40 percent since the cold war; while at the same time our peacetime commitments are up several hundred percent. 
And perhaps most importantly, defense procurement is down nearly 70 percent from the Reagan administration when this Nation developed the modernized, professional military that was victorious in the cold war. But we have been living off the Reagan buildup for nearly a decade, and the procurement holiday is over. 
The average age of our fleet of aircraft, ships, tanks, and trucks and other equipment has been increasing year by year, and our forces are having a difficult time maintaining that equipment. This is a major source of the readiness problems confronted by our military today. 
Yet, year after year this administration's budget falls short of its goal of procurement. And I project it will fall short again. 
Significantly, the report of the National Defense Panel last December highlighted that this administration needs to provide $5 billion to $10 billion a year to transform our military so that our Nation can leverage advances in technology and will be prepared to address what are envisioned to be the fundamentally different operational challenges in the 21st century. One of those, and perhaps the most important of those, is terrorism. 
In short, we still have a military designed to fight the conventional wars of the past, and it is poorly prepared to conduct this war on terrorism. Transformation to a national security posture necessary to address the threats of the future is necessary and cannot be successfully accomplished without a reallocation of resources and a revision of policy. 
I, therefore, urge the President to prepare this Nation for this prolonged conflict against terrorism, but in doing so use more than just strong words, but prepare us in a way so that we have the resources in place to successfully account for this threat and protect the American people. 
We face a range of threats and potential defensive strategies. Some of the latter could affect traditional American freedoms. 
At the very least, there should be an open and serious debate over how far we can go, or how far we should go, in altering the security environment in America and at our facilities abroad. Although an easily-defended fortress sounds like a good idea for diplomatic security, it also restricts the very access that effective diplomacy often requires. And we must recognize this. 
Mr. President, we face a difficult road in pursuit of a war on terrorism. 
Like other Americans, I am committed to the elimination of this scourge of terrorism. But I cannot help but be somewhat skeptical of the administration's determination and their commitment, and unfortunately I fear that we will find few allies willing to risk their security and reputations on the strength of the current administration's say so. The `say so' must be followed with the `do so.' 
Mr. President, hidden beneath the headlines of the last 2 weeks was yet another explosive revelation. North Korea has reportedly had as many as 15,000 people working to build what some suggest is a nuclear reactor or fuel reprocessing facility buried deep within a mountain. 
This, despite what the administration has touted as a landmark agreement stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons research and development program in exchange for food, energy, and the promise of two new light-water reactor power plants. 
The State Department, by stating that it sees no nefarious intent because the concrete for this facility has not yet been poured, is asking us to trust their assessment of the situation. Only 6 months ago, the President certified to Congress that `North Korea is complying with the provisions of the Agreed Framework' and `has not significantly diverted assistance provided by the United States for purposes for which it was not intended.' 
We are now told by administration officials that this new facility should not be considered a `deal-breaker' because its completion `will take half a decade or more.' 
To add insult to injury, we have learned that North Korea has test fired a 1,200-mile-ranged ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, overflying Japan. And they did so just days after the Joint Chiefs issued their commentary on the Rumsfeld report in which they reasserted the administration's claims that there currently is no imminently discernible ballistic missile threat warranting a national missile defense. They state, moreover, their confidence that our intelligence community would provide ample warning to permit meeting such a threat in the context of the President's 3+3 strategy. 
North Korea's test launch of this ballistic missile has demonstrated the truth of that old adage that actions speak louder than words. Doesn't the testing of a two-stage ballistic missile suggest that there is something for us to be worried about? How much harder can it be to launch a three-stage system capable of reaching the United States? 
I am not nearly as cynical about our intelligence capabilities as some, and so it is not idle curiosity when I wonder out loud whether the State Department officials knew, as the Pentagon did, that North Korea was planning a missile test. And if so, did the State Department raise this issue with the North Koreans during last week's meetings on various subjects including that of the underground nuclear-related facility? 
I can tell you that whatever the answer, it does not reflect well on the administration or the Secretary of State. Secretary Albright's comments yesterday that the test is `something that we will be raising with the North Koreans in the talks that are currently going on,' are less than inspiring and they fail to address the essential issue of what the U.S. did or might have tried to do to forestall this test. 
Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk. I have asked for it to be set aside. It addresses the question of the funding that is in this appropriation for North Korea related to development of nonthreatening nuclear facilities. Given the evidence and the information that we now have, these funds would be much better used on counterterrorism efforts, and this amendment seeks to transfer the funds for that purpose. 
I will be debating this amendment at a later time. And I understand two amendments currently have been offered and are awaiting a vote at some time in the future. But I want to alert my colleagues that I think this situation in North Korea is critical. I think the continuation of the current administration policy in this regard, in transferring U.S. tax dollars in accord with an agreement that was designed to terminate North Korean involvement in development of any nuclear facilities that could be used for purposes other than providing power to their nation is a serious matter. I don't think continuation of funds for that purpose is appropriate. I think that money is much better used to help prepare us to implement the administration's new policy on the war on terrorism, and we will be discussing that amendment at some point in the future. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is with reluctance I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Texas, because we share much the same goal. We had the same concerns about the deployment of our troops to Bosnia initially. We had the same concerns about the Dayton accord, which, as presented to us, was transparent on its face. It was disingenuous on its face that we could accomplish the task incorporated in Dayton with a 1-year period of time of deployment of our troops on the ground, a timetable unachievable by any measure. The continued existence of our involvement in Bosnia is something that I don't support. 
But I believe that the amendment has a fatal flaw, and the fatal flaw is that it makes Congress the determiner of how many troops and what time period those troops will be deployed once that decision has been made by the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States. 
I find it difficult to stand up here and defend the powers of the President of the United States, particularly at a time like this. But there are constitutional prerogatives and constitutional powers that I think need defending regardless of what your personal assessment is of any particular President. 
Second, I believe it is unwise policy for those of us to make decisions about the force levels of our troops or decisions that micromanage how those troops conduct themselves and how they accomplish their mission once the decision has been made. Clearly, our responsibility, if we disagree with the presence of those troops and the deployment of those troops, is to address that by eliminating the funding for those troops, but not to determine the force level of those troops, the kind of equipment they ought to have, and what their timetable ought to be. 
I quote from a letter from the Secretary of Defense dated May 21, 1998, when he says, `Our military commanders in the field have determined the level and type of force required to carry out the mission within acceptable risks. The mission force and guidance of the force currently planned for have been fully agreed to by military authorities. Military commanders'--under the amendment offered here--`Military commanders would be forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission accomplishment, operational consideration, and the fluid tactical situations they face. In addition, legislating withdrawal would incite heightened intransigence and extremism.' 
Mr. President, we sadly learned in Somalia, to cite one example, the disastrous and tragic consequences of political decisions overriding military requests. We lost some brave Americans unnecessarily because the political decision was made to not provide those forces with the necessary equipment and not base a sufficient force there until our mission was accomplished. I don't want to see us doing that again. 
We in Congress do not have the expertise to make that decision. Even if we did, we shouldn't make that decision. That is a decision that ought to be made by those who command the troops and make the decisions about their presence and what they need to be there. 
So I strongly, strongly urge my colleagues to vote to table this amendment, not because they necessarily agree or disagree with whether or not this is a proper deployment, not because this impacts our readiness, which it does, not because it is costing a lot of money, which it is, not because it was a bad decision to start with, and an unachievable mission and objective to start with, because it is, 
but because it tells our troops that we in Congress know more about what they need, what the troop levels should be, what the date of withdrawal should be, how we accomplish the mission of our military commanders. Those men and women in uniform who we put in harm's way have to have every advantage we can give them in terms of protecting their security, in terms of accomplishing their mission, and it is a decision that has to be made by people with military expertise and not Members of Congress. For that reason, I strongly urge that we table this well-intended but, I think, misguided amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate, on behalf of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, S. 2206, the Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998. 
This legislation is truly the result of a significant bi-partisan effort. We have worked closely with members of the committee to make important changes in program focus and in our expectations for measurable outcomes. 
Few federal programs engender the kind of positive feelings as do the programs we are discussing today: Head Start, the Community Services Block Grant, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, and a new program--close to my heart, the Assets for Independence Act. 
These programs all have one important thing in common--they represent the federal government at its best, forging public and private partnerships to combat the effects of poverty, and unleashing the vast resources of one of our most important assets--the local community. 
Whether in a Head Start classroom, a food bank, or a community action agency, the programs we are about to reauthorize provide a valuable link between families and the services and opportunities they need. 
I have had the privilege of visiting a number of Head Start programs in my own state, and have found at each one a common thread--the commitment of staff and of parents to be there for their children. In Head Start centers across America, parents serve as volunteers, as teachers, as aides, in whatever capacity they are needed. Many have told me that thanks to Head Start, they have gone on to higher education. Thanks to Head Start, their children have hope for a future. I say that it is thanks to their commitment as parents that their children's hopes have been realized.

Mr. COATS. That is correct. We were attempting to do a significant cleanup of a statute that has not been modified in any real way since 1981. We were informed that these programs were obsolete and had not received funding from the Department of Health and Human Services for some time. We therefore, as part of a package of technical corrects identified to bring the statute into conformity, repealed these two programs. Senator McConnell was very helpful in bringing this error to our attention and we have given him our assurance that it will be corrected in Conference with the House.

Mr. COATS. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. And I want to, specifically, because it does address a serious growing problem of the utilization of the Internet to provide unregulated gaming activities, but also because there is a broader issue at stake here that I think we need to consider. We will not be voting on it this evening, but it is very much a part of this and it needs to be addressed. 
First of all, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona is a good one because we clearly are dealing here with a new dimension in gaming, a new means by which gaming is provided to millions of Americans that is not accessible in the same way as it was before. 
In 1961 Congress, wisely, I believe, passed the Wire Act. The Wire Act was designed to prohibit the utilization of telephone facilities to receive bets or send gambling information. 
I do not have the regulative history in front of me, but I am almost certain Congress did that because it did not want the invasive nature of telephone lines and telephone access, which run into virtually every house in America, to be a means by which Americans could utilize that form of communication to enter into gambling. It did so because I am sure, if you went back and read the record, it understood the social cost, the consequences of gaming, and it wanted gaming to be a restricted activity. 
Of course, the advent of the Internet as a communications medium was not anticipated by Congress or even envisioned by Congress at that time, so therefore this Wire Act does not cover that. The Senator's amendment extends pretty much the provisions of the Wire Act to the Internet. I think for that reason, it is legitimate in terms of updating it to comply the law to changes in technology. 
The fact that it is supported by the FBI, with strong testimony from the FBI Director, the National Association of Attorneys General--as I understand, all the attorneys general have supported this from each State. Professional, amateur sports groups, including the National Football League, the NCAA, the NHL, NBA, Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, for obvious reasons, are strongly in endorsement of this. 
But then one of the most adverse collections of public interest groups and consumer advocates that have come together on an issue that I have seen for a long, long time--maybe ever--ranging from Ralph Nader's Public Citizen to the Christian Coalition, the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, have all endorsed the Kyl language which prohibits the Internet gambling. 
Now, they have not just specifically done so because it only addresses Internet gambling. They have done so because Internet gambling is simply a piece of a much larger program that is having, in my opinion, a dramatically adverse and negative effect on our culture. They see the Kyl amendment as one way of addressing a broader question. 
Ultimately, I think, we as Congress, we as representatives of the people, will have to come to grips as to what the impact of gambling is as it proliferates throughout our States and as access to gambling becomes more and more available to our citizens--and not just our adult citizens, but to our young people. 
There is a growing concern about pathological aspects of gambling. For decades, our Nation has studied and Congress has struggled with how we deal with drug and alcohol addictions, but the rapid expansion of gambling is injecting a new narcotic into our Nation's bloodstream. The problem of pathological gambling is on the rise. The National Council on Problem Gambling places the number of Americans with serious gaming problems at around 5 percent. Most studies confirm that estimate. However, as gambling becomes more pervasive and as gambling becomes more accessible, this number is increasing dramatically. Some say it has doubled; some say it might have tripled. 
As with other addictive behaviors, gambling not only affects the individual who does the gaming but it affects their families, it affects their careers, virtually every aspect of their lives. Separation, divorce, spousal and child abuse, neglect, substance abuse, and suicide have all been linked as side effects of problem gambling. 
Studies of high school students which have recently been undertaken have indicated that gambling is spreading into our high schools and spreading into minors' use in dramatic ways. Of course, nothing is more accessible to gaming than the Internet. If you want to bypass the normal restrictions and regulations that are placed on gaming--and those have been loosened dramatically--the quickest and easiest and most effective way to do so is through the Internet. 
I think Senator Kyl's amendment is particularly relevant at this particular time to address a part of the gaming problem and the gambling problem that exists in America. It does so in a way that can be utilized to at least make it more difficult, significantly more difficult, for minors to utilize the Internet as a means of gaming. Knowing what the pathological results and the consequences are, as we see a proliferation of individuals entering into gambling, we know that the raw number of individuals who are affected by problem gaming is going to increase dramatically. 
I will just say one more word about the second-degree amendment before the Senate. I think the second-degree amendment creates a huge loophole. In a sense, it creates a monopoly. It creates a monopoly for one entity to use the Internet to provide gambling access and therefore totally undermines the intent of the Kyl amendment. 
I understand that there is a statute outlining procedures by which these decisions are made. Nevertheless, that doesn't invalidate the amendment of the Senator from Arizona which addresses the broader issue. If we allow a significant exception for one entity, that one entity, obviously, will take advantage of that loophole and we will accomplish virtually nothing that the Senator is attempting to accomplish. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the second-degree amendment and support the underlying amendment by the Senator from Arizona which addresses, as I said, only a part, but a very significant part, of the problem, and particularly because it addresses the infusion and the explosion of gambling that is entering the lives of our children and is becoming accessible to them in ever easier ways, and particularly through the Internet. 
I urge my colleagues as we move toward a vote here to support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, shortly I hope, before the Senate adjourns for the weekend, the majority leader will be propounding some unanimous consent requests. Those requests are designed to set in place the procedures by which we will move forward next week and the legislation which we will take up. 
One of those unanimous consent requests will involve two pieces of legislation, one which I have offered, and the second which has been offered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, which deals with the question of pornography on the Internet. 
There is a history to this. In the last Congress, Senator Exon and I cosponsored legislation which introduced our colleagues for the first time to the dark side of the Internet; that side of the Internet that is not used for educational purposes, is not used for valid communication purposes, but which is designed to lure people into the practice of ordering and paying for pornographic images, words, and films, and other forms of pornography across the Internet. We know our first amendment prohibits our eliminating that and banning it. The right of free speech gives the right of adults to click into that, pay for that, subscribe to that, and to order that as long as that material is not deemed obscene. Even though it is indecent, and many of us would classify it as obscene, it has to be a standard set by the Supreme Court in upholding the first amendment. It is one of the perhaps dark sides of the first amendment. 
But we all understand that battle. And that is not what this battle is about. This battle is about protecting children from access to that material, which most of us would turn our heads from, or say that is enough, were we given the opportunity to look at it. In fact, all of the noble first amendment arguments that were raised during the debate in the last Congress against the bill that was offered by Senator Exon and myself melted away as Senator Exon invited Members into the Democrat cloakroom, both Republicans and Democrats, to view images that were copied from the Internet, and said, `Did you realize this material is simply a click away on your Internet?' At that time, the Internet was pretty new. People were still discovering it. Most of us had not even signed up, or even knew what it was. 
Members were shocked at what they saw, because what they saw was not the centerfold of Playboy Magazine. But what they saw was some of the most despicable, some of the most brutal, some of the most sadistic, some of the most sexually explicit material they have ever witnessed--young children being sexually exploited, bestiality, women being sexually exploited. I don't want to go into graphic detail here. But it was enough to convince the Senate that we ought to move on it and move on it right away. 
So it passed, despite again the pleas for first amendment freedom. That legislation, authored by Senator Exon and myself, passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 84 to 16. It was adopted by the House in exactly the Senate form, went to the President, the President signed it, signed it with a fair amount of publicity about the need to take action on this to protect minors, to protect children from this access. 
We had a standard in there--an indecency standard that was copied in the exact language that the Supreme Court approved for the dial-a-porn bill that went through and survived the Supreme Court review, and was declared constitutional even though actions were filed against it. 
We thought that since the Court approved it for telephone pornography, surely they would approve it for video pornography and pornography that came across the Internet. Picking up the phone is not a whole lot different than turning on the computer. Both are invasive. Both come into the home. Do they require some action on the part of the participant? Yes. You have to pick up the phone when it rings. You have to dial a 900 number. There is the luring of that. 
Again, we are saying that first amendment prohibits us from prohibiting adults from doing that. But the Court has upheld in the past, and they did in the dial-a-porn case, reasonable restrictions in terms of children having to prove that they were adults. And, if they couldn't prove that through verification of a credit card, or other means, then the material was not allowed to be passed on to them. 
The Court said the computer is not the same as the telephone. The computer isn't as invasive as the telephone. Well, the Court needs to understand the computer. I wrote that off to a generational problem--a generation of individuals. Maybe I oversimplify this. But I do not know how to better explain it, because it is the only possible explanation I could come up with as to why the Court made a distinction between a dial-a-porn standard and the computer standard. I don't think they understood exactly what the computer does and how accessible it is and what the Internet was, at least at that time. I think they know now. Maybe I underestimate the Court. Maybe there are other reasons. 
In any event, as we know now, whether you are in the classroom, whether you are in the school library, whether you are in your study hall, or whether you are in your dorm room in boarding school, or whether you are at home in your bedroom, or your den, or your family room, the computer is there, and a click away is the most lurid material we have ever seen available to children and adults, simply with the warning you have to be an adult to access this material and that is it. 
You click here if you agree, and we send you the material. 
I am going to describe as we get into the bill some of the effects this has had on our culture, on our society, and particularly on our children. My purpose here today is to plead with my Democrat colleagues to allow us to bring this bill to the floor. We have revised the bill that the Supreme Court struck down to comply with their objections, to address the question of the standard which we have changed from the indecency standard to the harmful-to-minor standard. The harmful-to-minor standard was the standard the Court laid out in the Ginsberg case, and we have taken that word for word. 
Second, we have restricted this, as the Court ordered that we had to do in order to meet the constitutional test, to the World Wide Web, to the commercial selling and display of these images, rather than private conversations, e-mail, chat rooms where individuals are engaging in this kind of activity. 
That is not how I wanted to draft the bill, but in order to get a court to uphold what is clearly the will of the American people as expressed by their representatives in an overwhelming vote in the Senate and unanimous acceptance in the House of Representatives and declarations by the President of the United States that the administration stands foursquare behind this, we find ourselves back here having to narrow the bill in order to survive court muster. 
That is what we have done. We have worked with constitutional experts to make sure that we have done it correctly, that we comply with the Court, and we want to give them another chance. We want to give them another chance, hopefully with a better understanding of the impact of the Internet, both positive and negative. And as I said, there is a dark side to the Internet, particularly as it relates to children, and we are trying to address that. 
Now, for several months I have been searching for ways to bring this legislation to the floor. It was introduced and referred to the Commerce Committee. It was debated there and passed out of that committee on a 19 to 1 vote. 
Some had said, look, the solution to this problem is the software packages that are being developed by the industry that parents can buy and attach to their computer or integrate into their computer and that will solve the problem and block the images. 
That is a partial solution to the problem but not a complete solution to the problem because the changing technology, the proliferation of web sites is so fast that no software can keep up with it. The ingenuity of the pornographers, the sellers of pornography is such that even the most innocent of words are now linked to a means by which pornography is pulled up. If you want to find out about Disney World or Disney movies or Disney characters, the pornographers have found a way to use the term `Disney' and click right into pornography. If you want to look up Boy Scouts, horses, dogs, cats, women, men, marriage, you name it, seemingly the most innocent of words, you are now linked directly to pornography. Why? Because the pornographers have discovered that this software is attempting to block the explicit language and they want to try to find a way in which to commercially entice people who are searching in other areas to be presented with this information so they can click into it. 
So what happened there, then, was Senator McCain's software bill and my Internet pornography bill were both passed out of 
committee. Senator McCain and I agreed that both are necessary to address the problem and that we would agree to go forward with these together. In recognition of the work that needed to be done in the Senate, we wanted to pursue a process by which we would agree to a time limit. We would agree to others offering any amendments that they thought appropriate. We would debate those, have a vote on those, let Congress express its will and go forward. 
This was not an attempt to tie up the Senate. In fact, we have been overly cooperative. I wish we had not been so cooperative. We were promised this would come forward. In defense of the majority leader, I think he has made a good-faith effort to try to bring this forward. But in each instance other circumstances have arisen, primarily the inability to get the consent of some Members of this body to allow us to proceed with this bill, debate it, amend it, vote on it, and either send it on or vote it down, whatever was the majority disposition. That is what we have been attempting to do. 
We are frustrated--I am frustrated; I am terribly frustrated--in our inability to take something that I think has overwhelming support to at least bring it up and talk about it. It seems that every time we get ready to go forward with a unanimous consent request to bring the bill up, we are notified that someone has put a hold on the bill. We find out who that is. We go over and talk to them. We offer them--they say, well, we want to offer an amendment on it. Fine. We will add your amendment to the unanimous consent agreement. Take whatever time you want on it. We will lock in an amount of time. We will give you a vote. We will eliminate second degrees. We do not want to do anything to cause you not to have an up-or-down debate on your amendment. That person agrees. 
We go back to the majority leader and say we are all clear; we are ready to go. Whoops, here comes another hold. Somebody else has a problem. We solve that. Now it is a problem on the McCain bill. The next one is a problem on the Coats bill. We solve both of those. The next one is a problem on the McCain bill. We solve that. We think we are ready to go. Whoops, another problem on the Coats bill. 
We are running around putting out fires, and we start to wonder if we don't have some kind of rolling hold process going on here where there has been a decision to block this legislation from coming forward, and we just simply pass on the baton of objection to different people who say; `Time is on our side. If we delay long enough, we will get into the appropriations process and we will block this and we will get through the year and we won't have had to deal with it.' 
I don't want to ascribe that motive to the other side, and that is why I am making this statement today because I just want to offer to my Democrat colleagues: if you have a problem with this bill, offer your amendment. I am not here to block your amendment. I am not here to block debate on your amendment. I am not here to block a vote on your amendment. I am not here to modify your amendment. I am here to simply say let's discuss the issue, debate it, vote on it, and move on. 
We have spent 4 weeks on the tobacco bill, and I understand, that was an important issue and that blocked a lot of other legislation. I understand that we have appropriations bills backed up, and we need to move forward on those, which is why we are willing to do a limited time agreement on this. But we cannot move forward, and are going to be forced to have to offer this to appropriations bills in order to get the Senate to consider it--offer it as an amendment, unless we can get agreement to bring this up, debate it with a time certain and move on. I do not want to do that. I do not want to interfere with Senator Stevens and the appropriators' efforts to do the business of the Congress that needs to be done. I understand things are backed up because of the tobacco bill. We heard a lot of great speeches in that tobacco bill about first amendment rights needing to be waived, why the first amendment did not apply as it involved advertising on tobacco. 
But we are not getting that same kind of flexibility and understanding from some of our colleagues as it applies to pornography. I think I would challenge those Members who think the first amendment is sacrosanct, that we cannot move forward with this, to ask themselves the question: Why is it OK to waive first amendment rights and not apply the first amendment to those commercial entities who are using the symbol of Joe Camel because that is so destructive to the health and welfare of our children, but when it comes to bestiality, when it comes to some of the worst forms of pornography that is wide open on the worldwide web and available to our children with the click of a mouse, that, oh, no, the first amendment must apply here? We have to be purists on this? 
I ask my colleagues to ask themselves as parents, and ask the parents they represent in their States, what those parents think is the higher priority issue. If they are given the choice, are they more worried about their children modifying their behavior and taking up smoking because they see a 5-second image of Joe Camel? Or, are they more worried about their children modifying their behavior and responding in a way because they have been able to view some of the most crass, indecent, and, in my opinion, obscene sexual images that we have ever seen? I think the resounding response is going to be: Senator, let's do first things first; let's address the problems that are real problems. 
So I conclude by pleading with my colleagues to let us resolve whatever problems you have with our going forward with this. We have been trying to do this. We have hotlined this 2 weeks ago. Both sides know what we are trying to do. If people have a problem, we will resolve that problem. But I hope there will not be an objection to going forward with that today when the majority leader propounds his unanimous consent request to allow us to go forward with this bill. 
If there is an objection--after 2 weeks of hotlines, after 2 weeks of going to Members saying, `If you want an amendment, have an amendment, but at least allow us to debate the bill'--I can only conclude there is some effort here to prevent us from even talking about it, even bringing the bill up. We have an opportunity to avoid all that today very shortly when that unanimous consent request is propounded. I trust we will be able to do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, America currently struggles with a disturbing and growing trend of youth violence. Between 1985 and 1994, the arrest rate for murders by juveniles increased 150 percent, while the rate for adults during this time increased 11 percent. Every day, in our communities and in the media, we see horrific examples of this crime. A 13-year-old girl murders her 3-year-old nephew and dumps him in the trash. A 13-year-old boy is stabbed to death while sitting on his back porch. A group of teenagers hails a cab and, after the driver takes them to their destination, they shoot him dead in an armed robbery. 
I did not have to look far for these examples. Each occurred in Indiana, a State generally known as a safe State, a good place to raise a family, not a dangerous place, yet a State where arrests for violent juvenile crimes have skyrocketed 19 percent in the early 1990's. Juvenile violence is no longer a stranger in any ZIP code. 
Yet, the problem is expected to grow worse. Crime experts who study demographics warn of a coming crime wave based on the number of children who currently are younger than 10 years old. These experts warn that if current trends are not changed, we might someday look back at our current juvenile crime epidemic as `the good old days.' This spiraling upward trend in youth crime and violence is cause for grave concern. So one might ask, what is driving this epidemic? 
Over 30 years ago, our colleague Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an official in the Johnson administration, wrote that when a community's families are shattered, crime, violence and rage `are not only to be expected, they are virtually inevitable.' He wrote those words in 1965. Since then, arrests of violent juvenile criminals have tripled. 
Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Children and Families, which I chair, held a hearing about the role of government in combating juvenile crime. The experts were clear: while government efforts are important, they are also fundamentally limited and incomplete. Government is ultimately powerless to form the human conscience that chooses between right and wrong. 
Locking away juveniles might prevent them from committing further crimes, but it does not address the fact that violence is symptomatic of a much deeper, moral and spiritual void in our Nation. In the battle against violent crime, solid families are America's strongest line of defense. But government can be an effective tool if it joins private institutions (families, churches, schools, community groups, and non-profit organizations) in preventing and confronting juvenile crime with the moral ideals that defeat despair and nurture lives. 
Today, I rise to introduce the National Youth Crime Prevention Act which will empower local communities to address the rising trend in youth violence. Specifically, this legislation authorizes the Attorney General to award $5 million annually for five years to the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise to conduct national demonstration projects in eight cities. These projects would aim to end youth crime, violence and family disintegration by building neighborhood 
capacity and linking proven grassroots organizations within low-income neighborhoods with sources from the public sector, including local housing authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other public entities. The demonstration projects will take place in Washington, DC; Detroit, Michigan; Hartford, Connecticut; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; Dallas, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. 
With these funds, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise will work with the grassroots organizations in the demonstration cities to establish Violence Free Zone Initiatives. These initiatives would involve successful youth intervention models in partnership with law enforcement, local housing authorities, private foundations, and other public and private partners. To be eligible for the grants, the nonprofit organizations within the demonstration cities must have experience in crime prevention and youth mediation projects and must have a history of cultivating cooperative relationships with other local organizations, housing facilities and law enforcement agencies. 
Funds may be used for youth mediation, youth mentoring, life skills training, job creation and entrepreneurship, organizational development and training, development of long-term intervention plans, collaboration with law enforcement, comprehensive support services, local agency partnerships and activities to further community objectives in reducing youth crime and violence. 
The success of this approach has already been demonstrated. Last year, The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise assisted The Alliance for Concerned Men in creating a `Violence Free Zone' in Benning Terrace in Southeast DC. The Alliance of Concerned Men brokered peace treaties among the gangs that inhabit, and frequently dominate, the city's public housing complexes. Benning Terrace in Southeast Washington, known to the DC police department as one of the most dangerous areas of the city, has not had a single murder since the Alliance's peace treaty went into effect early last year. Subsequently, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise brought the Alliance, the youths, and the DC Housing Receiver together to develop and implement a plan for jobs and life skills training for the young people and the community itself. 
Grassroots organizations are the key to implementing the most effective innovative strategies to address community problems. Their efforts help restore hardpressed inner-city neighborhoods by developing the social, human and economic capital that is key to real, long-term renewal of urban communities. The National Youth Crime Prevention Demonstration Act will provide critical assistance to our Nation's inner-cities as they combat the rising trend in youth violence by linking proven grassroots organizations with established public sector entities.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just want to join my colleagues here in urging our leaders and urging the Senate to move forward on legislation that has been debated and discussed and passed by the Senate that needs to be revisited. The Supreme Court struck down language I offered more than a year ago that was passed by this body by a 84-16 margin, passed by the House of Representatives, and signed by the President of the United States. 
That legislation attempts to address the commercial purveyors of pornography over the Internet--as invasive a practice as anything that we have seen. It makes the corner pornography shop pale in comparison in terms of access to some of the rawest, most explicit material that is available today, and it makes it available to children through the click of a mouse--in their room, in their home room, in their library, wherever a computer terminal is placed. It is easy access. 
In fact, it is an invasive practice that even the most innocent of typed-in requests can bring a flood of material that should never be accessible to children. It is even questionable whether it should be accessible to adults. The first amendment puts some pretty severe restrictions on us in terms of what we can do. 
We carefully drafted and designed our Internet pornography bill to address first amendment concerns. For some reason, the Court chose to distinguish the Internet from other forms of communication, and the very standard which the Court approved for telephone dial-a-porn messages was rejected for computer messages, saying that the Internet is a completely different mode of communication, not as invasive as the telephone. 
I think the Court is behind the times in terms of understanding how the computer works. I understand that. I am of the generation that is not quite sure even how to turn the thing on. For the younger generation, it is as easy and accessible and as comfortable for them to operate as for those of us who learned to drive a car when we were young or the technology that we adapted to in our generation. 
Nevertheless, the Court has ruled. We took that ruling. We modified the language to comply with the Court's restrictions. I have been attempting to bring this bill to the floor for several months. We have been blocked in doing so, not because it does not enjoy a majority of the vote but because the computer industry and the Internet industry do not want any restraint whatsoever. 
We are trying to protect the innocence of children. We are trying to give parents a tool by which they can protect their children. We are trying to put penalties in place which will allow us to enforce restrictions against commercial purveyors of pornography that is harmful to minors. We have revised the standard to comply with the Supreme Court dictates, and we trust that this new legislation will pass Court muster. But in order to do so, it has to pass this body first. I think we are at the point of resolving the holds and the differences of opinion on how to proceed with this legislation. 
Senator McCain has legislation which provides access to software packages that are a help, but an imperfect help, in terms of dealing with the problem. I have legislation which I guess would be described as a stick to go along with the McCain carrot, the hammer to lay down the enforcement and put the penalties in place, put the restrictions in place. I think the two are very necessary for us to try to get a handle on this problem. It will not fully solve the problem. 
The first line of defense has to be the family. It has to be the parents, has to be their oversight of what their children have access to--not only in the home but in the school, in the library. It is disappointing that schools and libraries--in particular, library associations--have opposed what we are trying to do. We think we have a consensus now on how to move forward. I am pleased that we are closing in on that and urge our colleagues to support the efforts that will take place shortly. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the sweeping Social Security Legislation introduced by my colleagues--Senators Gregg and Breaux. The `21st Century Retirement Security Plan of 1998' is designed to strengthen Social Security now, encourage personal savings, and expand the availability of private pension plans. 
Senators Gregg and Breaux recently co-chaired the National Commission on Retirement Policy. This bipartisan commission of lawmakers, economists, pension experts, and businessmen released a report calling for legislation including, among other things, personal savings accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age. The `21st Century Retirement Plan' implements both these provisions and aims to serve a two-fold purpose: It strengthens the Social Security system--ensuring payment to all of the hard-working Americans that have paid into it. And it expands opportunities for private retirement savings--which will provide Americans with more options to save and invest in their future. 
As we approach the dawn of the 21st century, it is common knowledge that the aging baby boom will create huge financial problems for future generations. Without changes, the Social Security trust funds will be unable to pay full benefits beginning around the year 2030. Therefore, a thirty-eight year old individual, making an average wage, will have to live until the age of 91 to get back what he paid into the system. This is not the time to propose patchwork solutions to this problem, but rather to seize this unique opportunity to restructure the entire system. I believe that this legislation is a logical first step toward achieving that goal. 
President Clinton has also jumped on the save Social Security bandwagon, although his plan is to sit back and wait until we have three or four `national town meetings' to discuss the ramifications of changing the system. Coincidentally, those meetings conclude at the end of this year--which just happens to be an election year. This epitomizes the lack of courage of the part of most of our elected officials. 
This legislation will save the Social Security system through the next century without raising taxes. In fact, under this plan, taxpayers would be able to invest 2 percent of their current payroll tax in private savings accounts modeled after the Government's thrift savings plan. This change would not affect current retirees, but would rather assist current tax-paying Americans preparing for their retirement. As a tax-paying American, I trust myself to manage my money much more than I trust the Federal Government to provide for my future. 
This allocation of part of the payroll tax would be offset by our current budget surplus and a gradual rise of the retirement age from 67 to 70 by 2029. Further, these accounts would provide a higher rate of return for recipients. This would, as provided by the bill, lower guaranteed Social Security payments and ease the burden on the system. 
This plan improves retirement security and protects future generations by strengthening the safety-net aspect of the Social Security system and providing Americans more options for savings and investment. The `21st Century Retirement Security Plan of 1998' contains the courage and common sense necessary to save our children and our children's children from the economic strife that is bound to arise if we do not address this impending problem.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this bill represents a strong bi-partisan consensus on the Labor Committee to ensure that students maintain access to post-secondary education through vital student opportunity programs, such as TRIO; healthy, stable, and streamlined loan programs; and a simplified student aid process. I am pleased to have contributed to this important bill and look forward to its quick passage today and on the floor. 
This bill was developed using several guiding principles. First, we strove to maintain the primary focus of the Higher Education Act since its inception in 1965, which is to ensure that students have access and opportunity to pursue higher education. We have strengthened the major student opportunity programs in the Act by focusing more on the needs of low-income students through an expanded Pell Grant program, and making needed reforms to the TRIO programs. 
In an effort to ensure continued access to higher education programs for all students, these amendments also include a new, low interest rate for student loans. This legislation sets a student loan repayment rate of 7.43 percent which represents a significant reduction in the interest rate for students. The interest rate that was scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1998 would have destabilized the successful Federal Family Loan Program by causing thousands of lenders to stop making student loans which would have left students without loans for the school year. The interest rate included in these amendments provides a significant reduction to students while maintaining the long-term viability of the student loan programs and ensuring that students will continue to have access to private loans at the lowest interest rate in 17 years. 
Another vital principle for these amendments was the improvement and modernization of the student aid delivery system. This legislation creates a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) within the Department of Education aimed at providing quality service to students and parents. The utilization of this PBO which will incorporate the best and most successful practices in the private financial sector, coupled with other reforms aimed at streamlining the student aid regulatory requirements will result in a 
better managed and higher quality federal student aid system. 
A third principle which guided these amendments was the need for much-needed reform of teacher preparation programs. A recent report found that 36 percent of teachers in the core subjects, such as math and science, neither majored nor minored in those subjects. Annually, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers enter the field, which means about 1 in 4 new teachers are not prepared to meet the enormous responsibilities of teaching. This shortage of qualified teachers is the only real shortage of teachers in this country, and it most seriously impacted inner-city students who are often taught by teachers who lack a degree in their subject matter. This problem is growing--between 1987 and 1991, the proportion of well-qualified new teachers entering the field declined from 74% to 67%. 
I am very pleased that these amendments include a new initiative for teacher training and professional development aimed at addressing the shortage of qualified teachers in this country which replaces most of the existing teacher preparation programs with a two-pronged approach. This initiative encourages state level reforms intended to produce well trained and highly competent teachers, and local level partnerships intended to improve under-performing teacher education programs. 
States will compete to receive some of these teacher training dollars and can use the grants to strengthen their teacher certification requirements, create or expand alternative certification programs to attract highly qualified people from other occupations to the teaching profession, to decrease the shortage of highly qualified teachers in high need areas, or to develop programs which reward excellent teachers and remove unqualified teachers. 
This reauthorization was also guided by a strong desire to streamline and consolidate the many programs and activities which are found in the Higher Education Act. This Act has become increasingly complex over the years and these amendments make great strides in simplifying the Act and better targeting its programs and activities. 
I would like to thank the staff who have worked on this important legislation for the last year: on Senator Jefford's staff, Susan Hattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, Cory Heyman, and Pam Moran have done excellent work on this bill. In addition, Marianna Pierce with Senator Kennedy and Suzanne Day with Senator Dodd have worked diligently to ensure that this bill represents a strong bi-partisan consensus. Thank you all so much for your long hours and excellent work. 
Again, I am pleased to have been a part of crafting this important legislation.

Mr. COATS. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-coats-in-3-19980709</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. It is right on this very point, because on the list the Senator from New Mexico placed, I think, on the desk here--at least I have that list; I think it is the same as his chart--Indiana is also a State listed that requires secondary teachers to acquire academic accreditation. I think the States ought to do that, or at least ought to make that decision. I don't think the Federal Government ought to mandate it for the same reasons the Senator from Connecticut stated. 
However, I am concerned now that the Senator from Connecticut has indicated that his State is one of the States you listed under the `Yes' column, as requiring that, as is Indiana, yet it doesn't require it in the sense that the Senator's amendment requires it in order to receive funds. We just learned of the amendment half an hour or so ago and have not had an opportunity. Our department of education is closed in Indiana now. I haven't had the opportunity to call and say does this conform? Is this across-the-board? Does this conform with the amendment of the Senator, or are there exceptions like there are in Connecticut where, for certain disciplines, you require the academic major? 
I am in the same position, I think, as is the Senator from Connecticut. I cannot vote to support that if I don't know whether or not my State is going to be penalized. Does the Senator know the answer to that question relative to the State of Indiana?

Mr. COATS. I join the Senator from Connecticut in saying I think the Senator's efforts are laudable. I do think, as the Senator from Vermont has enumerated, there is a lot of language in this bill which I think reflects what the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Mississippi are attempting to do, yet it does it in an encouraging way rather than a penalizing way. Given the fact there is a lot of confusion about how this amendment applies to these States, and there is no way we could determine that this evening, I wonder if the Senator wouldn't be interested in withdrawing his amendment--at least working with us to try to accomplish these goals, but not in a way that puts us in a position where we will penalize our State.

Mr. COATS. I won't belabor this because I think most of the points have been made. I do want to join both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee in opposing this amendment for all the reasons that were stated. We have spent a considerable amount of time and effort in the committee to try to address the very areas that the Senator from New Mexico has raised. We have worked with the Senator from New Mexico in attempting to incorporate a number of his suggestions and ideas. 
I think the Senator from Connecticut raises a critical point relative to the fact that a chart out of Education Week does not really tell us the full status of where each of our States reside relative to these requirements. And because the Senator's amendment was substituted in lieu of another amendment, most of us are not able to get ahold of our State education departments at 8 o'clock in the evening to find out just exactly where we stand. We end up then potentially penalizing our States for failure to meet the requirements of the Senator's amendment rather than providing, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, incentives for them to do so. 
Also, I point out to Members that the Senator's amendment violates the actual Department of Education Organization Act policy, which I would like to read from. Section 103, titled `Federal-State Relationship' says: 
It is the intention of the Congress, in the establishment of the Department, to protect the rights of State and local governments and public and private educational institutions in the areas of educational policies and administration programs and to strengthen and improve the control of such governments and institutions over their own educational programs and policies. The establishment of the Department of Education [this was written into the code when the Department of Education was established] shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government over education or diminish the responsibility of education which is reserved to the States and the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States. 
It goes on to talk about basically attempting to micromanage from the Federal level decisions that even with the establishment of the Department of Education the intent of Congress is listed. 
Now, in a sense, we are doing that. But we are doing that here in this bill in a way that encourages and still leaves the 
decisions to the States to determine what their policies will be, and in this regard, policies relative to qualifications for teachers. 
We all support the goal of higher qualified teachers being available. But the Senator's amendment, I believe, takes us one step further than we ought to go by penalizing those States that do not have that standard. And I think there are some 15 or 20 that fall in that category. But as we now have learned, there may be several more. There is no way we can find out this evening. There may be several more that have modifications of that requirement that require it in certain disciplines but do not require it in other disciplines. 
The Senator from Connecticut cited the example of an individual affluent in a native language that might major in a different subject, and yet because they do not need to major in that language, but then intend to teach in that subject, they want to have an academic major in another subject. Are we going to penalize a State institution which receives funds from the Federal Government for allowing that to take place? 
I think there are unintended consequences here that we ought to realize. And we worked on this carefully in a bipartisan way. There was a unanimous consensus coming out of committee in terms of how we would address this particular issue--18 to nothing vote. 
I urge Members to support the hard effort that has been put into this and not at the last minute here, on an amendment we really have not had time to review and even check with our States on, to add this mandatory language to this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the hour is getting late. I doubt too many Members are listening to this debate. I will be brief because I know we want to move on to get these amendments finished so we can begin voting. I would like to just briefly respond regarding this amendment. And I will not repeat the benefits that flow to students under this legislation. Senator Jeffords of Vermont outlined those benefits: almost $10 billion in new student benefits paid through extensive loan provider cuts and other means over a period of years. 
I think it is important to recognize that students benefit greatly from this legislation. It is kind of ironic that we are spending this amount of time debating a bill that came out of committee on a unanimous vote, 18-0. We felt we had a bipartisan package put together that would sail through the Senate here, but we are obviously tied up a little bit on some of the provisions. Hopefully, we can resolve some of them. 
I think it is important to recognize that what those of us who oppose the Harkin amendment are doing, as we have done on a number of other amendments, is trying to preserve a viable, competitive system in terms of providing service and collection and the provision of loans to students. There has been a concerted effort over the past 6 or 7 years to eliminate the private sector loan program in favor of a full Federal-run program. There were efforts to take it to 100 percent. Those were thwarted after a lot of contentious debate under previous Congresses. 
But I thought at least finally we had settled on the concept that competition is good, competition within the system is good, and we ought to have two programs side by side--a direct loan program run by the Federal Government, the Department of Education; and a private program that was operated in the private sector, involving guarantor agencies and banks and others that provided students benefits for years. And it was, of course, backed by the Federal guarantee. 
But it operated pretty well. There were concerns that those guarantor agencies were reaping too much benefit from that particular program. 
So over the last several years there have been a variety of measures enacted which substantially reduce the fees that go to the guarantor agencies. This bill takes $500 million from the guaranty agencies to pay for student benefits. Between 1993 and 1997, revenue to student loan guarantors was cut by $2 billion. That is $2.5 billion we have taken out. Student loan guarantors get back another $1 billion in reserves over the next 5 years under the Balanced Budget Act that the Congress entered into last year. As a consequence of that, the concerns that were raised by the Senator from Arkansas become very real. 
Ten student loan guarantors have ceased operations due to increased risk, declining revenues. The Alabama Commission on Higher Education, Delaware Higher Education Loan Program, Maryland Higher Education Loan Corporation, Mississippi Guaranteed Student Loan Agency, Ohio Student Loan Commission, Puerto Rico Higher Education Assistance Corporation, the State Education Assistance Authority of Virginia, the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana, the Student Loan Funds of Idaho, and the Virgin Islands Board of Education have all ceased operations. 
I don't think it is possible to accurately predict just which future agencies will go out of business as we keep squeezing the private sector and keep expanding benefits and provisions through the public sector, but a list has been put out that guaranty agencies would fail in a number of States over the next several years if the Harkin amendment is adopted and if the process of continuing to impose restrictions and squeezing the revenues of the private sector so they can't compete equally with the public sector continue to be enacted. 
Now, the ultimate decisionmakers shouldn't be Members of Congress or the Department of Education. The Department of Education, obviously, has a bias in favor of expanding their scope in this program and becoming the only provider. That is what their intent was originally. That is what they have been working for. They have had the support of some Members of Congress on that. 
I think we ought to go back to some basic philosophic understandings of what it is in this country that has proven over time to provide the most effective service and benefits at the most effective cost. And it hasn't been the Federal Government. You can't point to agencies of the Federal Government--whether it be Post Office, which used to be under the Federal control, but now is semi-independent--you can't point to any agency and compare it to a private agency and say the Federal Government is a more efficient provider of services at a more effective cost. 
I remember asking the First Lady when she presented the Clinton health care plan, I said, `Mrs. Clinton, you have done a lot of work on this particular plan, but there is, in my opinion, a faulty assumption underlying the entire proposal, and that is that the Federal Government can provide services more efficiency and cost effectively than the private sector.' I said, `In my experience here in Washington, I haven't come across any Federal Government program that has been able to do that. When matched head to head, they haven't been able to do that.' The reason they haven't is because they don't have to compete. They don't have stockholders to whom they are accountable. They don't have a bottom line they have to reach. They simply turn to Congress for additional funds to fund whatever service they are providing. The very nature of bureaucracy and the very nature of monopoly leads to the inevitable conclusion that the taxpayer loses in the long run when the services aren't provided. 
So here we are yet again with yet another amendment designed to put the private sector at a less competitive advantage. As I said, the real decisionmakers in this process ought to be the users of the product. And the users of the product are the schools. 
Despite credible efforts by the Department of Education, in fact, some fairly heavy-handed tactics in some cases, two-thirds of all students choose to use the private sector to provide their loans and only one-third choose to use the Department of Education. The Department of Education, even within that one-third, which is less than what they had planned for, is having trouble even providing effective services to that one-third. 
Let me refer to a GAO account which gave failing marks to the Federal Government and a number of Federal credit programs. Their report is not news to anyone who has followed the debacle that has occurred at the Department of Education in administering the Direct Loan Program. During its first 5 years, institutions have been unable to fully reconcile disbursements received in Federal funds. There have been cost overruns estimated at $40 million, despite ongoing problems in the Direct Loan Program and their attempts to protect it, either through the imposition of additional fees, cuts, additional revenue squeezes on the private sector, and additional 
protections for the Direct Loan Program. 
So I think putting aside the intricacies of this program and whether there was an origination fee or an insurance fee, whether there is enough in the reserve fund for 5 years or 3 years or whatever, we ought to go back to the basic premise of, do we want to substantially expand the role of a department of government which has not proven itself an efficient administrator of these services, which has not proven itself as an entity capable of providing services in an efficient manner? 
But if we are not going to do that, do we at least want to have a viable, competitive process, whereby the users of the product can make the choice? I think that is really what this is all about. We need to remember that last year's bipartisan balanced budget agreement called for the preservation of two healthy loan programs and that if there were cuts, those cuts should be equally divided between those two programs. That has not happened under the Harkin amendment. The cost of the 25-percent reduction that the Senator from Iowa is talking about doesn't come out, it is not equally divided between the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program, the entire cost savings comes out of the FFEL Program. 
So it is a violation of what the agreement was last year, the balanced budget agreement. It violates the principle of that agreement by taking the fee from the private sector program and using it to cover the cost of loss of revenue in the public sector program that results from the change that occurs under the Harkin amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the Harkin amendment, preserve the benefits and the balance that was created by the committee, supported by the committee in an 18-0 vote, and move forward with this education program that I think is important for our students and important for education initiatives that are in it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will be brief. I just want to make a couple points. 
Point No. 1, the legislation that is before us, the base legislation, already contains a carefully designed analysis and feasibility study of market-based mechanisms for student loans. The Kennedy amendment goes much further than that. We have a study in place. We will get the information needed to make a determination as to whether or not we want to move to an auction market-based program. 
Secondly, the last thing the Department of Education needs right now is another big responsibility. It can't handle the responsibilities it currently has. It has not been able to successfully manage the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program. Why would we want to consider giving it something else to manage? 
Let me just cite a few things from the inspector general relative to the Department's administering of the Direct Loan Program. The IG has concluded that audits at 16 direct loan schools found 8 major weaknesses in 16 of those programs. They also stated that in their audit, the weaknesses they found were representative of the majority of direct loan schools. They said: 
They are very likely to exist at these other direct loan schools. The Department reviewed disbursement amounts recorded at one school and found a total of nearly $300,000 hadn't been entered into the direct loan system. 
The IG's report said that 3 of the 16 schools maintained excess cash as a result of improper cash management practices. 
Let me quote again from the IG's analysis of the department's ineptness in running the programs that it has now. And I quote: 
The Department does not currently have a process in place to match specific drawdowns with specific disbursement transactions. 
The IG goes on to say: 
53 percent of student status reporting was inaccurate. On average 71 percent of student records in the national student loan data system were inaccurate; 58 percent of transactions were not reported by schools through the department in a timely manner. 
The IG says that today, if data is not reported timely, due diligence and timeliness of reconciliation of loan data may be adversely impacted. 
We probably all remember, or should remember, that in the 1995-1996 academic year, 1 million applications were backlogged at the Department of Education which caused families and students all over the country to be put in a position where they didn't know whether they were going to get a loan or not. Two years later, the Department sent out 2.7 million forms to fill out and had the wrong shading on it, and therefore the forms were not processed right, and they ended up with hundreds of thousands of backlog as a result of that. 
This goes on and on and on, the inability of the Department to handle the one-third of direct loans that it now has. So why do we want to throw in another major initiative at the Department of Education. Let them at least get the initiatives that they currently have jurisdiction for under some control. So I would urge my colleagues to join with the chairman of the committee in defeating the Kennedy amendment.

Mr. COATS. I thought I heard the proposal that the virtues of the market system were so wonderful that the whole thing ought to be put out into the market system, and that is probably a good idea. So why--I don't understand; you can't have it both ways. You cannot try to attract it into the public sector and not provide competition in the Department of Education and yet kick everything else into the free market. 
So I am saying we may have the makings of a deal here. If the Senators think the whole thing ought to go in the market, why, we can probably get that done pretty quickly and it might benefit everybody.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't intend to speak for more than about 5 minutes. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for granting me this time. I also want to thank my colleague and friend, Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia, for deferring so I can maintain a schedule. I will be brief. 
I am enthusiastically supporting the product brought out of the Finance Committee that we will be voting on shortly to rein in what has been in many instances an out-of-control agency that has, I think, trampled upon some liberties of the American people. I commend the Finance Committee for doing this. It is much needed reform. I am glad that we are finally here on the floor debating and, hopefully, ready to pass this. 
Former Chief Justice John Marshall, in a landmark case many of us learned in law school, McCulloch v. Maryland, said that `the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' We understand that the power to tax is a power that is granted to Congress. So we have no one to point a finger at in that regard other than ourselves. But the power to destroy, I am sure, Marshall was referring to was the fact that taxation, if improperly applied, can destroy. 
But there is a second point to that which I think is important; and that is, if the administration of the power to tax is abused, it can also have the power to destroy. 
We have heard about the documented, systemic abuse of taxpayers in the oversight hearings that have been held. This bill will, hopefully--and I believe will--effectively end the agency's disregard of taxpayers rights. We have heard the horror stories of taxpayer mistreatment by armed IRS agents raiding taxpayers' homes and Americans being subjected to years of harassment, unsubstantiated audits, audits that are targeted at low-income and favor high-income, audits that are targeted at those of modest education, quota goals, disregard for rules and regulations, and even laws, in order to achieve a certain product goal. Those are abuses that have been documented, have been discussed, and really form the basis for the legislation that we are addressing today. 
I would like to relate just one story that was relayed to me by one of my constituents in Indiana. He gave me permission to tell this story but requested that I only tell it if I did not disclose his name. `Why?' I asked. He said, `Because I fear retribution.' I said, `You have nothing to fear.' He said, `No. I fear retribution. I have been through so much, I don't want to give that agency or anybody associated with that agency any cause to come after me again. I cannot go through that again. So use my story but don't use my name.' 
The history is that as he was preparing for Christmas and shopping to purchase both gifts and food for his Christmas dinner for his family, he was shocked to learn that his credit was denied because he was told he had no money in his bank account. His entire savings had been wiped clean by the IRS for back taxes and penalties. He immediately called the IRS, and he was told that the reason for this was that 10 years ago, in 1987, the IRS discovered that his 1987 tax return was not on file and that he had not answered any of the registered letters that were sent to him. Of course, he never received those registered letters because he had not lived at that address since 1987. 
Subsequently, he had filed returns for each year, which the IRS had processed, and he had received responses back from the IRS at his new address. So all of the subsequent years, the IRS knew where he was. But in 1987, with a previous address, because they had lost his return and because the registered letters notifying him of that were sent to his old address, the two computers didn't match, or the two agents didn't check with each other. And, therefore, my constituent found that his entire savings had been wiped out just before Christmas, and he learned about it when his credit was denied as he was shopping for his family. 
That is just one tale. But it doesn't end there. That is horrific enough. 
A few months later, after some paper shuffling at the IRS, this gentleman was told--based on the information that he had to provide again to the IRS--they actually owed him a refund of $1,500 for his 1987 return. He had supplied duplicate information again to the IRS. However, they said since the statute of limitations had run, he was no longer entitled to his 
refund. 
That is the kind of thing that causes your mouth to drop open and I guess you pull your hair out. I don't think that is why I lost my hair. But had I been that taxpayer, the outrage that would have ensued I think is something that all of us can identify with. 
After a lot of intervention and a lot more paper shuffling, he did finally get his $1,500. Only the IRS could pull off something like this. 
These stories of abuse and mismanagement go on and on. I will not detail those in the interest of time. 
It is unfortunate and sometimes, I think, disgraceful that an agency of the greatest democracy in the world could have attributes that could best be described or identified as a paramilitary wing of a despotic regime. 
So it is past time, I believe, that this legislation pass the Congress, and be signed by the President, and that we urge the new Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Rossotti, to conduct a thorough housecleaning based on what we have put in this legislation. 
The IRS exists to serve the American people, not the other way around. There has to be accountability for this agency. There has to be more protection for the taxpayer. Efficiency and integrity need to be the twin goals of the IRS. Therefore, passing this legislation is a very important step to achieving this end. 
I want to close, Mr. President, with a quote that is etched into the stone of the IRS building headquarters here in Washington. It is a quote from Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said, `Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.' If that in fact is the case, if taxes are what we pay for a civilized society, then we have every right to demand that the tax collector act in a civilized manner. The IRS has not done that. The tax collector has not acted in a civilized manner. We pay our taxes. We expect a civilized processing of those taxes. Hopefully, this bill will take us toward that end or achieve that end. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.

It appears funding is available for additional projects within the appropriated spending provided in the bill. I believe the Midwest Proton Radiation Institute is an important effort that will be of great benefit to the city of Bloomington and to Indiana University. In addition, Senator Lugar  and I believe the MPRI is a worthwhile and appropriate project for funding under community development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I strongly support an initiative to establish a Quadrennial Intelligence Review and an independent, nonpartisan National Intelligence Panel. This process can be modeled after the Military Force Structure Review Act of 1986 which passed the Senate by a unanimous vote of 100-0. This Act directed the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the National Defense Panel (NDP) which conducted comprehensive reviews of all aspects of defense. These reviews have produced a much needed update of our defense strategy, a revised defense program, and a vibrant debate on the course of our defense capabilities. 
I believe that a process of internal and external comprehensive review fashioned on this QDR and NDP model can be equally effective in the area of intelligence. I intend to work with the Committee to develop a provision establishing a Quadrennial Intelligence Review and an independent National Intelligence Panel for inclusion in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, very briefly, in the time we have, I don't enjoy opposing matters offered by my friend from Oklahoma, but I have a fundamental disagreement with him on this particular issue. 
We do four basic things in defense: We pay for people and their quality of life; we research, develop, and purchase modern weapons and give them the very best capabilities; we support the readiness of our forces; and we pay for infrastructure--the bases and all the infrastructure for support. 
We know four things: We know that our military people are underpaid and that their quality of life is suffering; we know they live in inadequate housing; we know we have a $10 to $15-billion-a-year shortfall in research, development, and modernization; we know that we have strains in growing, cracks and fissures in our readiness; and we know that we have too much infrastructure. The Department of Defense says we cut personnel and everything else by 40 percent, infrastructure by 20 percent. 
What this amendment does is send a message. It sends a message that we will subordinate the interests of caring for our people, of supporting new modernization of weapons, of making sure of our readiness, in order that we keep the infrastructure that we have, in order that we protect civilian jobs and bases that the Department of Defense does not want and does not need. 
It is exactly the wrong message to send to our service people, to send to our national defense. It jeopardizes our national security. We want to take reasonable steps to put in place a process to remove excess infrastructure so we can address these three other critical needs. 
I yield to my friend from Arizona.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his kind remarks. 
I also want to congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for a significant victory. The Senator had indicated during the debate that he believed and had reason to believe that the bill we were sending to the President, which was signed by the President and exercised by the President, would not stand constitutional muster. The Court affirmed that conclusion. 
I also congratulate the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for being the guardian of this institution. He stands at the gate to retain its hallowed practices and rules and traditions. And in this modern age of seeking the expedient and convenient over the tried, tested, and true, the Senator's contributions are extremely important to the future of this institution. I commend him for that. He is also a constitutional scholar without peer in this institution. 
This Senator, as I did yesterday and as I do today, stands up with some trepidation in terms of discussing issues and matters of the Constitution, because I know I am doing so with someone who has studied it for far longer and has a far better understanding of it than I have. 
When Senator McCain and I addressed the issue of the line-item veto, we consulted a number of constitutional scholars. It is fair to say that there is disagreement. There are constitutional scholars, recognized scholars, who believed that the process of enhanced rescission was not line-item veto, per se, enhanced rescission was a constitutionally acceptable process, that it did retain a balance of power, it did retain the prerogative of Congress to override the Presidential veto. And it is my understanding, along with Senator McCain's, on a quick reading, I would say--not even a full reading, but a very brief overview of the decision that is handed down, and I look forward to reading the entire case--that what the Court addressed was more procedural than principle, the procedure of the omnibus bill being presented to the President and, as the Senator from Michigan said, being signed, and then in a sense accepted and then reviewed relative to certain aspects of that. 
The Court obviously sided with the argument so ably presented by the Senator from New York, who has left the floor--the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from New York, the Senator from Michigan, and others. 
It is the principle that Senator McCain and I are attempting to address, not the procedure. We had spent numerous hours of discussion and debate in attempting to establish a procedure whereby the principle of a balance against what we considered to be--and many, I think, of the American people considered to be --an irresponsible exercise of the spending power of the Congress--not the right to have the power of the purse, but an irresponsible use of that, and the voluntary transfer of some of that power, yet retaining a balance in terms of the division of power between the branches, as the founders intended. That was our intent. 
As Senator McCain said, the bill that passed the Senate with 69 votes as a separate enrollment procedure would have, I believe, addressed the concerns of the Court by presenting to the President separate bills on each line item of spending. We 
didn't include the tax issue. That was added at the request of members of the Finance Committee. Ours went specifically to spending items. That was different from what was passed in the House of Representatives and perhaps now, in retrospect, a faulty decision. We ceded the Senate procedure to the House procedure, and we paid the price of that ceding--or perhaps not; we don't know for sure what the Supreme Court would have done with that. 
The principle of each decision by the Congress standing on its own merits--having the light of day shine on that spending decision, so that the American people know that our yea is a yea and our nay is a nay, and not the procedure of hiding what arguably could be decisions on spending that would not stand the light of day and not receive a majority of support, because it is subsumed by the importance of the broader legislation--is really the principle that we are attempting to address. 
We want what is decided in the back halls to be debated on the Senate floor. We want to give each Senator and Representative the opportunity to say, `I support that,' or, `I don't support that,' and discuss it on the merits, rather than saying, `I didn't know about that because it was added in the back room. It was part of a thousand-page bill, and we didn't have the time to peruse each line of that legislation. And, yes, had I had an opportunity to vote on that separately, there is no way I would have supported that irresponsible use of the taxpayers' dollars.' 
So we are seeking a way of attempting to bring into the process a means by which we could achieve a check against imbalance, against what we considered to be spending that had not been given the opportunity to be addressed and discussed and debated on the merits. We think it is a deceptive practice. We think it is a distasteful practice. We think it does not enhance the public's opinion of this institution and the processes by which we make decisions. We think it is an irresponsible exercise of the fiscal discipline that the taxpayers of America expect us to exercise in the spending of their dollars. 
That is the genesis behind the legislation that Senator McCain and I have authored and fought for 10 years to pass, and finally did pass. 
So are we disappointed with the Supreme Court decision? Yes, deeply disappointed. Do we see it as a permanent defeat? No, we don't. We think a preliminary reading, and hopefully a further careful reading and study of the Supreme Court's decision, will indicate that the Court decided on the basis of the procedure used, not on the basis of the principle involved. The principle involved ought to be at the center and heart of our debate and discussion. I hope that as we engage in future battles--I guess that is the proper word, because those were heated debates, but principled, heated debates--we can focus on the principle and not the procedure. 
Questions have been raised about the cumbersome nature of separate enrollment procedurally, with a large piece of legislation having to be broken down into its separate pieces. Up until a few years ago that was an argument that carried a lot of persuasion and a lot of weight. But with the advent of modern technology--computer technology--and with some visits by myself and others to study with the enrollment clerk, and the witnessing of the utilization of that modern technology in terms of how bills are printed, how they are enrolled, and how they are presented for enrollment, we have the opportunity to take advantage of those marvelous improvements in the way in which we procedurally enroll legislation that is now technologically feasible. What would have taken literally days and perhaps hundreds of enrollment clerks, scribes, working away diligently in the basement of the Capitol separating out the bill, enrolling separate pieces of legislation, and having those signed and presented to the President of the United States, and having the President attempt to deal with it to the point he would have no other time to deal with any of his other duties and certainly achieve writers' cramp, that no longer is a problem. Technology has allowed us to bypass that. 
So we intend to introduce as early as today a procedure--a process--which 69 of our Members, on a bipartisan basis, have supported, which addresses the principle of the issue and not the procedure of the issue. We look forward to the debate that will occur. We look forward to the opportunity to give our Members, all 69 of them--Democrats and Republicans--the opportunity to, once again, support a responsible practice of spending the taxpayer dollars in the most responsible way that we can. 
Mr. President, I will close. I wish I were as eloquent and as articulate as the Senator from West Virginia. I wish I could reach into my mind and recall the words of the famous scholars, constitutional experts, or a poem that was appropriate to the discussion. I don't have that capacity. I don't have that talent. I admire that greatly in Senator Byrd. What discipline it must have taken to commit to flawless memory the words of historians, the thoughts of some of the greatest thinkers that this world has ever seen, the magic and beauty of the poetry that expresses those thoughts in the recall that the Senator has. 
I am leaving the Senate this year. I will take with me many lifetime memories, not of process but of people--some of the most extraordinary people, I think, ever to have had the privilege of being born into this greatest of all nations and serve in this greatest of all institutions. I take away a vast reservoir of memories of 100 unique individuals with some of the greatest and most extraordinary talents to be found anywhere. And none of them, I think, transcends the abilities and the extraordinary capabilities of the Senator from West Virginia, who I have enjoyed serving with, even though we have found ourselves on opposite sides of a number of issues, and we have found ourselves on the same side on several issues. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to the Murray-Snowe amendment and give a little bit of history. It is not the first time we have visited this amendment. In fact, we have been debating it each year, I believe, since I have been in the Senate. So we are not plowing any new ground here. We are replowing old ground. Nevertheless, it is an important issue. 
On the amendment that has been offered, I think it is important that Members understand the current state of play and understand what it is we are voting on. Some history can perhaps help. 
Mr. President, let me inquire as to how much time is remaining on this side.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when 10 minutes have been used. I don't believe I will use more than that. 
Mr. President, since 1979 the Department of Defense has prohibited the use of Federal funds to perform abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. The bill before us today, the Department of Defense bill, continues that prohibition. When we debated this issue last year, it was abundantly clear that the current restriction was not onerous. It did not put any women at risk. It is a policy which is fair. It was fair and sound last year and was supported by the Congress, and it remains fair and sound today. 
What we are trying to do is maintain a consistency in Federal policy relative to abortion. That policy, described as `the Hyde amendment,' states that taxpayer money should not be used against the wishes of taxpayers for elective abortions except in some very limited circumstances--exceptions are allowed in the cases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. But beyond that, the Congress has consistently supported prohibitions against the use of taxpayer dollars to perform abortions. That is something that has been upheld by the Court. It is constitutional. The case of Harris v. McRae upheld the Hyde amendment. It did not find a constitutional right to require the taxpayers to fund abortions. So I don't believe the Constitution is an issue here. 
Time and again we have disallowed the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases where, as I said, rape, incest or life of the mother is at issue. We are trying to maintain that policy. That was a policy that was maintained without problem until 1993 when President Clinton issued an Executive order to reverse the policy. Rather than go through the Congress and have the people exercise their will through their elected Representatives, the President just simply issued an Executive order, saying, `I don't like the current policy that Congress has established, and I am going to override it with an Executive order.' Under that policy, the President's change in policy, defense facilities were used for the first time in 14 years, not to defend life, as our military hospitals are charged to do, but to take life, and to do it with taxpayer funds. 
In 1995, the House and the Senate voted to override the President's Executive order, reversing that policy and making permanent the ban on the use of Department of Defense medical facilities to perform abortions with the exceptions of rape, incest, and endangerment of the mother's life. 
So again we are today debating that issue. The amendment before us would strike that ban and reinstate the policy instituted by the President through his Executive order that the Senate overturned 3 years ago. Proponents of the amendment argue that abortions under the Clinton order did not involve use of taxpayer funds since servicewomen are required to pay for their own abortions. But, Mr. President, that statement evidences a misunderstanding of the nature of military medical facilities. 
Military clinics, unlike the private hospitals, receive 100 
percent of their funds from Federal taxpayers. Physicians are not private physicians who happen to be contracting with the hospital, but they are physicians that are government employees paid entirely with tax revenues. All of the operational and administrative expenses of military medicine are paid for by taxpayers. All of the equipment used to perform abortions is purchased at taxpayers' expense, and, therefore, it is impossible to separate out that which is Federal funds utilized for abortion from that which is private funds. 
The only way to protect the integrity of these taxpayers' funds and the integrity of the policy is to keep the military out of business of performing abortions. Taxpayer money should not be used if it goes against what I believe and I think the Congress has supported, the moral and religious beliefs of the taxpayer, and in this case the taxpayer, through their Representatives, elected to Congress have expressed time and again that they don't feel their tax dollars are appropriately used to perform abortions. 
The question is raised: If abortions are disallowed, does that not put those servicewomen who are seeking to have an abortion at risk? It does not. As we have repeatedly demonstrated and said, along with certification from the Department of Defense, nothing in this policy dictates the decision of the woman, whether or not she wants to have an abortion or has an abortion. It simply says you can't use taxpayer funds for an abortion. Because of the commingling of funds and the impossibility of separating funds, we don't want to use military hospitals for that abortion. But nothing prevents that woman from going outside of the military hospital facility to utilize another hospital in countries where there are those hospitals. Because the law of the country--say Italy--does not allow abortions or support abortions; the military has provided transport for that individual who seeks the abortion. There has never been a complaint filed about inability to go and have that abortion. 
So I think Members confuse the issue sometimes when they come to the floor without having heard the debate and say, `This is a vote on a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.' 
I have strong and deeply held feelings about that. We have debated that issue on this floor time and time again, and we will debate it more--the nature and the meaning of life, the right of the unborn versus the right of a woman, and the decision in terms of whether one right has a preeminence over another right. But that is not what is at issue here today, and it shouldn't be confused in this debate. The issue is not over whether a woman has the right to an abortion. That is a debate for another day. 
The issue is whether that abortion should be partially paid for by taxpayer funds, or performed at military hospitals. We have a policy in place that allows women who seek to have an abortion while they serve in the military, or their dependents, to have that abortion. Nothing prohibits them from doing that. But we simply have to have a policy that says that cannot be performed in a place where taxpayer funds are being used to accomplish that, or at least to accomplish part of that. 
We have not received any evidence that indicates that this is a prohibition on women, on their ability to have an abortion, to make a choice to have an abortion. It simply retains a policy that has been consistently upheld by this Congress and by the Court that says that the taxpayer has a right to put limitations on whether or not their taxpayer funds are used to provide abortions. The Congress has consistently voted to uphold that policy. They make what I think are legitimate and reasonable exceptions in cases of rape, cases of incest, and cases of where the life of the mother is in danger. 
So I hope that Members would see this issue for what it is--not a women's right to choose; we can discuss that at another time--but whether or not taxpayer funds should be used to perform abortions. 
Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time. In fact, I see the Senator from Idaho is on the floor. I would be happy to have the chairman yield him whatever time he desires.

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I believe we will be able to yield back time. I don't know that we have any other speakers here. Let me just quickly summarize the reasons, the basis of why we oppose the amendment. 
I believe the amendment is a solution in search of a problem. There is no identified problem with women in the military or their dependents seeking the right to have an abortion of their choosing when there simply is a provision in current law which states on this issue the military is not going to decide whether or not that woman should have an abortion. 
We simply are saying that we want to uphold the policy that has been in place now for nearly 20 years, with the exception of the President's overturning it for a 3-year period, that says the taxpayers' funds should not be used to perform abortions or to pay for any portion of abortion except in certain limited cases --the case of rape, the case of incest, or where the life of the mother is in jeopardy. 
Because of the nature of military hospitals, they are 100 percent funded with taxpayer funds, including all their equipment, all their facilities, and all their staff. Military doctors are Government-paid employees. Mr. President, 100 percent of their pay is from the taxpayer. So it is impossible to utilize military hospitals without using taxpayers' funds. Even if the woman pays for the abortion, the equipment will be used, facilities will be used, Government employees will be used. So we are simply saying to that woman who seeks an abortion, we would like you to go outside the military health care system to have your abortion. Since you are paying the cost anyway, it is not a question of affordability. 
Then the question arises, What if facilities are not available outside of military hospitals? The military has recognized this is a possibility. It is not a problem at all at any U.S. base, military institution, nor in many foreign institutions. But there are certain countries that have bans on abortions being performed in their country on the basis of that country's policy. The military, in that instance, has said we will make space available on air transport for these women to go to a place where the abortion is legal. 
So, I don't understand what the problem is. And, rather than overturn a law which has been upheld by both the courts and enacted by this Congress again and again and again--the Hyde language--it seems the best way to proceed is to leave the current policy that has been endorsed in place and defeat this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the current law, to vote against the Murray-Snowe amendment, again, because there is no 
identifiable problem to which this amendment seeks to advocate a solution. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

In my view, the most appropriate vehicle at this point to incorporate this initiative in the defense bill is to seek a provision in the Conference report. Senator Thurmond, would you assist our efforts to do so during the upcoming conference?

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee has discussed in great detail the very situation that the Senator from Arkansas raises. We held numerous hearings. I had numerous private meetings with members of the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, contractors and others on this question. 
Last year, in the authorization bill, I offered an amendment to impose cost caps and a number of accountability features on the F-22, not as an opponent of the F-22, but as a proponent of the F-22, a marvelous new advance in technology that I believe is needed, but one in which this Congress has an absolute responsibility to ensure that the engineering, manufacturing, development, flight testing and production schedules are done in such a way that provides accountability to the taxpayer, gives us the product that we are looking for, and gives it to us in a manner that we can afford. 
The last thing we want is for the F-22 to go the way of the B-2 where we get part way into a program, and because the costs become so excessive, we have to cancel the program or stop the program where it is, or the B-1, which was rushed into production without adequate testing, and we have encountered numerous problems with that platform ever since. 
In recognition of the very issue that the Senator from Arkansas raises; that is, rushing to production before we have completed adequate preproduction flight test hours, this committee, after considerable negotiation with proponents, opponents and all those in between of the F-22, has arrived at a committee consensus that we will require a specified number of flight test hours and that any money that is designated for production will be fenced and not released until that threshold is met. 
We arrived at that number on the basis of intense discussions with the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, the contractor and others, recognizing that given new flight testing techniques and production techniques, what will be required for the F-22 may not necessarily be what was required for tactical airplanes developed in the past. Nevertheless, we want to be assured that we have at least reached a minimum threshold before any funds can be released. 
We built a little window in here for the Secretary of Defense to certify that under these new testing techniques, manufacturing techniques, and engineering techniques that a lesser number of hours is required. He can waive a certain portion of those flight test hours, but not below a certain level. 
We have requested that no waiver can be granted at a level below 183 flight test hours, a level which the Department of the Air Force, the Secretary of Defense, the contractor and everybody involved in this feels is adequate. 
We require more than that. We require that 10 percent of plan schedule for flight testing be completed before those fenced funds are obligated for production. However, we do allow for a waiver. 
The bottom line here is that the Committee agrees with the Senator from Arkansas that not enough flight testing has taken place and that we shouldn't go forward. In fact, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, Mr. Gansler, has already delayed the production decision for 1 year on the basis of the fact that there have been delays in the planned schedule for flight testing and that we need more flight testing. 
By the same token, we are trying to balance the risk of going forward with fewer hours than what we normally would require with the risk of incurring very substantial additional costs as we slip production time schedules, as we delay moving from the engineering, manufacturing and development phase to preproduction phase or, in this case, production phase. And we are trying to balance all that. We have arrived at a pretty delicate compromise. 
I will say that we do agree with the Senator that we need more flight testing hours before we rush into production, but we do also have to recognize that we have put demands on the contractor and the Air Force in terms of a fixed-price contract which requires a great commitment on their part at substantial risk, and we have to find an acceptable balance. 
We think we have found that balance. As I say, those proponents of the F-22 on the committee, and the opponents of the F-22, and those in the middle have agreed this is an acceptable balance. The only thing I will say about the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is that it goes a little further than the provision agreed to in the committee, and I believe we should hold to the committee position on this, because it does achieve that very delicate balance between the extra costs that will incur if we demand more testing, and the risk of not having enough flight testing. 
We have built a 6-percent--between a 4- and 10-percent window in there, but we require the Secretary of Defense to put his signature on the line and his Department's credibility on the line before we waive below the 10 percent level. 
For that reason, I urge Members to support the committee position. We will be going to conference with that and hope that they will understand that the underlying bill addresses the problem raised by the Senator from Arkansas, and we think it addresses it in a way that allows us to gain confidence that before we go to production, we have completed adequate flight testing. And yet our position also takes into consideration the fact that under a fixed-price contract and under the requirements that are imposed on the contractor and the Air Force, we are not incurring these substantial additional costs through the delay. 
For that reason, I hope Members will support the committee position. Any remaining time I have I reserve, and I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this may sound surprising, but the committee agrees with Senator Bumpers. We have studied this and we absolutely have language in this bill that requires testing before we buy or before we fly. 
We have carefully worked out a compromise on this issue with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, contractors, Members of Congress--those for the F-22 and those against the F-22--to ensure adequate testing, but also to do so in a way that doesn't add unnecessary costs--some estimated at more than billions of dollars by delayed production--by unnecessary testing. The Secretary of Defense has to certify before we can go forward. 
We urge people to support the committee position. We studied this and we agree with Senator Bumpers: More testing before we fly--but not as much as Senator Bumpers thinks we need.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is an emotional subject, a difficult subject. I am former chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee and still a member of that subcommittee. And it is an issue at which I have looked and studied and struggled with for some time. 
I have come to an opposite conclusion of some of my friends, and I want to tell you why I have. First of all, everyone needs to understand the Byrd amendment is not an effort to return to segregated military units. It is simply designed to say that at that initial entry point, we are dealing with a situation that involves young people, many coming out of very disruptive backgrounds, many in a very vulnerable position. And we have seen--tragically seen--some exploitation of that, which is wrong and absolutely needs to be handled in the most direct way and that sends out a very clear signal that we have zero tolerance on this. But I want to make clear, nevertheless, that the situation we are dealing with in this amendment is with young people at their initial entry point. 
Now, we do not need another commission. We enacted a commission because I think a lot of Members did not have any faith that the DOD-appointed commission would give an objective view. 
I think everyone was surprised, including the Secretary of Defense, when the commission, led by our former colleague, Senator Kassebaum, came back with the conclusion and the recommendation that we ought to have segregated training at that initial entry point, and then that a merger of those two separate units of male and female trainees at the next level of their training. The question is, Why? Why did that commission come back with that recommendation to the surprise of everyone, including, I think, the Secretary of Defense? 
The reason is that the Kassebaum commission went and visited those same sites that I have gone and visited. And they talked to female and male trainees, and male drill instructors and female drill instructors. And they came away with the inescapable conclusion that I think any of us would, or at least most of us would if we went and asked the females, asked the women and men, asked the people at that initial entry point what they preferred, what they thought worked, what was best? 
I went to Fort Jackson where the Army trains with integrated male-female training. About 30 percent of the females do not have female drill sergeants in their platoons. They have all male drill sergeants. And those females said, `We want female drill sergeants.' Then I went to Parris Island, and at Parris Island, the female marines said, `This is the best thing that ever happened to me to be associated with a mentor who can provide me guidance as a young lady in how to deal with these questions, how to deal with these kinds of decisions, how to deal with these tough situations, how to deal with this pressure, how to deal with this demanding training. It prepares me.' 
I cannot say it better than the letter that was forwarded by a female corporal in the Armed Forces. And it reads: 
`Sir: . . . This is very distressing news to me and my fellow women marines. There is no way I would ever have made it through basic training with men present. I experienced mixed boot camp for just a few days while in basic training. It was the worst training days we had. I am all for equality, but this is madness. With no disrespect to the Army, the problems they have had [ought to] be proof [of this madness]. I can honestly say that if I had it to do over again and basic training was mixed gender, there is no way I would do it. I would not make it, not with the level of dedication and concentration it took when there were only females. I can't imagine having to deal with the underlying sexual tension, the jealousy, and unconscious way I would feel every day.' 
I am convinced that any of us who would take the time to go and visit the women marines in their initial training at Parris Island would feel as proud as any American would ever feel about the abilities of women coming out of sometimes very, very difficult situations, gaining the self-esteem and bonding together with their female drill instructors and each other, and being prepared to move on to that next stage in their training. 
And if you listened and asked them, literally to a person, they told me--this entire company of women marines told me-- `This is the way it ought to be initially. Then we're prepared to move on in our advanced training and integrate with the men. But we wouldn't give up this experience for anything in the world. This is the way we ought to be trained.' 
The Marine Corps model is a model that works. It has demonstrated its effectiveness. The other services are struggling to make it work, without the requisite number of female instructors, and with a very uncomfortable situation. 
So why not take a model that works and why not follow the recommendations of the commission that has already been in place, appointed by the Secretary of Defense, headed up by our former colleague, Senator Kassebaum, which I do not think anybody thought had a bias in favor of separated training going in, but came away, after their exhaustive experience in examining all of the training camps for all of the services, and came away with the inescapable conclusion that we ought to have gender segregation at the initial entry training level. That is what the Byrd amendment is about. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I, along with the chairman and others, have worked long and hard attempting to fashion a way in which this Congress could express its dissatisfaction with the prospect of an indefinite troop commitment in Bosnia. 
We now are going on the third year of that commitment at a cost that continues to escalate. I believe it is approaching, if it hasn't exceeded, $9 billion--this is despite the assurances of the administration that the troops would only be necessary to accomplish the military portion of the Dayton accords for 1 year. 
The then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, in testimony before our committee on October 18, 1995, said: 
NATO's plan will call for the implementation force to complete its mission in twelve months and to withdraw. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in testimony before the House National Security Committee on October 18, 1995, said: 
NATO's plan will call for the implementation force to complete its mission in twelve months and to withdraw. 
Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State, said in a speech to the National Press Club on November 9, 1995: 
We believe that twelve months is a reasonable period of time for the implementation force to have accomplished its mission. 
The President of the United States, President Clinton, in a letter to Speaker Gingrich dated December 13, 1995, said: 
NATO and U.S. military commanders believe and I expect that the military mission can be accomplished in about a year. Twelve months will allow IFOR time to complete the military task assigned in the Dayton agreement and to establish a secure environment. Within 1 year we expect that the military provisions of the Dayton agreement will have been carried out, implementation of the civil aspects and economic reconstruction will have been firmly launched, free elections will have been held under international supervision, and a stable military balance will have been established. 
Those words from the President of the United States. He was supported by Richard Holbrooke, former Assistant Secretary of State, who negotiated the Dayton agreement. Mr. Holbrooke said: 
The President has given a very clear commitment on the twelve months. That is our policy. It will remain our policy. 
General Shalikashvili once again said, in an article, in an interview with the Washington Post of April 3, 1996: 
I'm absolutely convinced that America will not participate with military forces in Bosnia after the conclusion of this year. 
On and on it goes. Yet it is now 1998. There is no indication of when our military forces will be removed from Bosnia. Their continued presence has come at considerable cost to the taxpayer--as I said, $9 billion-plus and counting--and no indications by the administration that forces will be withdrawn at any time soon. 
There is little disagreement on this floor about the concern over the escalating costs and the indefinite commitment. The real question before the Senate is how we accomplish the goal of withdrawing those troops. It is clear that what was promised by the administration as a consequence of the Dayton accords has not been accomplished on the civil implementation. 
Our armed forces have done a marvelous job in meeting the military obligations. In fact, the military tasks were essentially accomplished in that first year. A poitical decision was made, however, that forces needed to remain in Bosnia to provide a secure environment so that the civilian portion of Dayton could be accomplished. 
I was one who voted against the use of our troops to enforce the Dayton accord. I did not provide that support. Senator Levin I believe, did provide that support. Yet today we are joining in attempting to send a message from the Congress to the President and to our allies that we do not want an indefinite commitment, that we believe the military mission has been successfully achieved--that it is time to begin the process of bringing our troops home. While there has been some progress in civil implementation, when I traveled last December with the President to Bosnia, I saw little evidence of successful civilian implementation. 
It has taken 2 years and an extraordinary amount of outside pressure to get the three nations involved to agree on a common license plate and a common foreign currency--what is seemingly the most easily defined civilian implementation aspects of that accord. Yet, the parties, over a 2-year period of time, could not even agree on what the license plate would look like that each of them would put on their vehicles, or what the currency would look like, in order to establish a common currency for that one country. 
So I stand here as one with grave concerns and deeply held doubts about whether or not we are ever going to accomplish what Dayton attempted and promised, and that is reunification of a country that appears to not want to reunify. Key issues such as resettlement of refugees; establishment of a civilian police force that, to date, has not been deemed effective in providing any kind of stability; establishment of judicial reforms that would provide a basis for enforcement of the law on an equal and fair basis. Resolution of many of these issues appear far down the road--if they are even achievable. 
I come back to the central question, which is, now that our troops are there, who makes the determination and what is our obligation as Members of Congress relative to establishing the continued presence, limiting that presence, or requiring that withdrawal? I happen to believe strongly that our responsibility, as defined by the Constitution, is to determine the funding, whether or not we will financially support the commitment that has been made by our Commander in Chief. 
Now, Senator Levin and I have wrestled with this question in terms of how we can best express a message to the President of the United States that we do not support an indefinite commitment, that we do believe that a transition should take place from an American presence to European support for whatever military forces are necessary to provide continued stability. But we do not believe that we are in a position; nor do we have the right to define a timetable or a troop level. We believe that is a decision that ought to be left to the military, ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, and that is where the responsibility lies. We do so because we don't believe we have the expertise to define what that troop level should be. 
When the discussion was undertaken relative to our placing troops in Bosnia, virtually every individual who represented the military, from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to the Secretary of Defense, to the commanders who were called forward to testify, said we need the flexibility to determine what is necessary to accomplish our message and to provide for the security for the forces that are deployed in Bosnia. We need to make that decision based on our military expertise and based on what we see as the threat and what is necessary to provide for the security of those forces. 
This is not a decision that ought to be made by Congress, regardless of our own expertise or what expertise we think we might have, having served on the Armed Services Committee or learned through our association with the Department of Defense. We are not in a position to define that troop level number. This decision has to be left to the military commanders. 
We learned, by tragic experience, how political intervention and policy can sacrifice lives and place our troops in jeopardy. All of us have freshly imprinted on our minds the tragedy in Somalia, as a request by the commander of our forces in Mogadishu for armored forces to provide the force protection was denied primarily for political reasons, because they wanted to avoid the perception that the U.S. was enlarging our presence in Somalia, but that we were drawing down. We drew down too far and we lost some great Americans because we were not able to provide them with sufficient protection. It is not our decision as to what that level of protection should be. 
Secondly, Senator Levin and I--and he will speak for himself--believe that it is important that we not set an arbitrary timetable for accomplishment of the mission or for withdrawal of troops. That simply sends a signal to extremist forces and others who are intent on destabilizing the situation. All they have to do is wait until a certain date, pull back and give the appearance of stability, give the appearance of cooperation, knowing that when a certain date is reached, our troops will be withdrawn. 
We want to keep that indefinite. It doesn't mean the decision can't be made to remove the troops tomorrow, or the President can't sit down with our allies and discuss what the future force should be. I believe an amendment will be offered--if not to this bill, to the defense appropriations bill--by the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Texas to establish a certain level and a certain timetable. It may be that that is what our military commanders decide is in the best interests of accomplishing our military mission and protecting our forces. But that ought to be their decision, not ours. 
So those are the primary reasons--the protection of our forces, for a limited success, in stabilizing the war and to protect against the potential of extremist groups taking advantage of the knowledge they have of our force size and to protect against the concept that if we define a specific date through a statutory definition, that any hopes of accomplishing a mission that has been agreed to--as I said not by this Senator, but by the President and supported by a majority--can be realized. 
To conclude, our amendment essentially expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. ground combat forces should not remain in Bosnia indefinitely, in view of the worldwide commitments that we have, the impact on our forces, on our readiness, on our deployment, and on our ability to address other needs; that the President should work with our NATO allies, and other nations who have military forces participating in the stabilization force, to withdraw ground combat forces from Bosnia within a reasonable period of time. The difference here is reasonable. We allow a reasonable period of time, leaving it again to the discretion of our military, rather than the fixed time. Consistent with the safety of those forces and the accomplishment of the stabilization force's military task. 
We think it is appropriate to define a way in which we can continue, when we withdraw ground combat forces, to continue to provide support for a follow-on European force, and to have a ready reaction or Ready Reserve force in the region--not in Bosnia, but in the region, available to help if necessary; that the President should inform our European allies of the will of the Congress, should this amendment be accepted; and that the President should consult very closely with congressional leadership with respect to the progress he is making in terms of achieving the goals of the Dayton accord. 
That is the essence of our amendment. As Senator Thurmond said, this is not a committee amendment that was voted out of committee, though it is supported by a number of members on our committee. We think it is an important amendment to lay down. We think this debate is important. Following this, there is much about what is going to be said by those who may not support this and who want something different than what I am going to agree with. 
Much of what they have put in their proposed amendment, which apparently will not be offered to this amendment and to this bill but at a later time, I am going to agree with.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will conclude, so that my colleague, Senator Levin, may proceed, simply by saying that we asked for the Department of Defense response to this amendment. They reported back. The Department of Defense says: 
The Department has no objection to the proposed amendment in general. 
The Department is concerned that paragraph (2) under Sense of Congress could be misinterpreted as a weakening of US resolve and commitment to the process initiated under the Dayton Agreement. While the Department agrees that there should not be a permanent US presence in Bosnia, the timing and nature of discussions on withdrawal of the international coalition should be driven by our continued progress on the ground and not by artificial deadlines. 
And The New York Times reported the following on June 13, 1996: 
There has been no change in the President's view of the current IFOR mission. It will last about a year: Michael McCurry, White House spokesman, New York Times, 6/13/96. 
The Washington Post reported on July 25, 1996 the following:  
There is no successor mission. . . . We're not anticipating any such thing: Vice President Albert Gore, Washington Post, 7/25/96. 
I agree in terms of their discussion about `artificial deadlines.' But I want to point out that the Dayton agreement clearly stated that the presence of the military was necessary to accomplish the military task. And I believe that military task has been accomplished. 
I think the debate on this floor, if there is to be a debate about our troop presence, should not be defining what the size of that presence should be and the timing of that presence. I think it should be on whether or not there ought to be a presence. 
There is going to be a legitimate debate, I believe, as to whether or not we want to stay involved in Bosnia. And the will of the Congress ought to be expressed on that, or the appropriations ought to be defined in a way to support whatever is necessary, if we are going to be there, determined by the military, or zero if we determine they shouldn't be there. 
That ought to be the debate, rather than defining what the mission should be, what the size of the force should be, and putting deadlines in terms of achieving those goals. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I just want to make sure that it is understood by all concerned--and I am asking the Senator this question--that the benchmarks that were read are not a necessary precondition to our accomplishing the military mission; that the amendment that we are offering is an amendment that says our troops should not stay there indefinitely; that we should transition to a European-only-led force, supported by us but not with the use of U.S. ground combat troops. 
I wouldn't want to leave the impression here that the request by the Senator from West Virginia, if I can have his attention, the establishment of those benchmarks are not necessary for the accomplishment of the military mission. I think where the Senator is going is the fact that some of those benchmarks may never be established. If that was a precondition to our troops staying on the ground in Bosnia, they might be there for another millennium.

I just want to make sure that I understand that what he is trying to say is that it is important, a discussion over what the benchmarks should be or could be or ought to be, or how it ought to be modified, and should not be confused with what we are attempting to do in this resolution. 
Discussing benchmarks, I say to the Senator from Texas, is perfectly legitimate, but not as an objection to the resolution that is before us. It is partly, maybe even primarily, I would ask the Senator, because of the benchmarks, because we agree that they are indefinite, because we agree they are not achievable that we want this resolution.

The only thing we do not want is for those of us in Congress to tell the military how to protect itself. But we want to send a message that we do not care what the President's interpretation is; we are dealing with what Congress wants to say. 
What Congress wants to say is, Mr. President, I do not care what your exit strategy is, whether I agree with it or disagree with it. We believe that our troops should not be there indefinitely. We believe you should talk to our NATO allies and European allies and tell them that Congress does not support an indefinite troop commitment. We want our combat forces out of there. We want a European force--if you think it is necessary to stay there, you better tell the Europeans to put a European force together. If you want our support, logistics support, intelligence support, communications support, rapid reaction that might help you in a crisis, yes, we can consider that. 
But we want those combat troops out of there. I just don't want to confuse the President's policies--exit strategy, benchmarks, General Clark's interpretation. That is not what we are about here. We are talking about Congress' resolution. 
I ask the Senator if that is what we are up to?

But I am having difficulty understanding how the power of Congress to regulate troop levels--and I understand that we set force levels. The Congress, through our committee, authorizes certain force levels for the Army, for the Navy, and the branches. But I don't understand how that would apply to the deployment of those forces or the utilization of those forces within a specific military exercise. I don't know that that is a power that is granted to the Congress. I don't see that here in the Constitution.

I suppose if Congress said there shall be no more than 5,000 members in the U.S. Navy, that would impose a limit to how many troops could be deployed, and the maximum number you could deploy would be 5,000. But I don't see where once the level is established, and we have established a level of nearly 500,000 Active Army, for instance, I don't see how that would translate to Congress having the power to dictate how that 500,000 force level would be assigned.

That requires the President to tell us a specific number dictated by the decisions made by the King.

What, in your judgment as Commander in Chief, with the advice and consent and assistance of your military commanders, should the number be to perform a certain mission?'--there is a great distinction between that and a direction to the President of the 
United States saying, `You must give us a number based on an average of troops that are committed by nations outside Congress' control,' and it cannot exceed that. 
The President here couldn't have the discretion to say, `Well, we need whatever troops are necessary to protect, or complete our mission, or carry out our mission in this part of the world, or to protect our forces.' The President is being dictated to arrive at a number, which the President may disagree with, or the Commander in Chief, or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagrees with in terms of ability to carry out that mission. 
That is my concern with the Byrd-Hutchison amendment.

But the question I asked the Senator is whether that power extends to once that force is raised, once Congress determines to raise an army, once Congress appropriates funds for that army, once Congress establishes force levels and sets the rules, at what point does Congress, does that extend--I should add, does that extend to the actual utilization by the Commander in Chief of the power--does the Congress have the power to determine how those forces then should be deployed to protect and defend the interests of the United States?

Mr. COATS. No, the Senator didn't take it that way at all. The Senator is simply trying to get an answer to his question as it applied to the language in the Byrd-Hutchison amendment which has been talked about today, and trying to understand the role of the Commander in Chief vis-a-vis the role of Congress in that specific, requiring that specific requirement of the President as Commander in Chief relative to that language in the Byrd-Hutchison amendment. I was just trying to clarify it.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, first of all, I have great respect for the Senator from West Virginia. His knowledge of the Constitution certainly is far deeper than mine is, or perhaps will ever be. And I also share his deep concern about the duplicity of this administration in terms of its dealings with Congress on the issue of Bosnia. What was assured to the Congress by the President and his designees prior to deployment in order to secure congressional support and appropriations for that deployment is far from the picture that exists today. Many of us knew that, once in, it would be tough to get out, and that a year, probably, would be far insufficient to accomplish the mission that was there, that was outlined for us. This is the reason I voted against it in the first place. 
As well-intended, as humanitarian, as compassionate as the decision was to try to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia, there was no realistic means by which that nation could be reborn into a nation of multi-ethnic harmony that would at least be accomplished within that 1-year period of time, or perhaps even a decade or more. So, many of us feared that, once in, we would have trouble getting out. 
I certainly agree with the Senator from West Virginia when he says that the Constitution clearly gives Congress the responsibility for providing the funds for the first person in uniform, the first ship ever built, setting limits on how many ships we build or the size of our force. The question that the Senator from Indiana was trying to raise, and still doesn't feel he has the answer to, is whether or not the power extended to the Congress extends to defining how that force, once raised, is used in defense of the Nation, in defense of our vital interests. Which is the entity, the Congress or the President as Commander in Chief, that makes the decision establishing a process by which decisions are made, through his military commanders, about utilization of the forces that are raised after the Congress appropriates the funds to raise those forces? And it goes to the specific question of whether or not we have the authority, in Congress, to set specific limits to how those troops, once raised, within that category of troops--who has the power to do that. 
But let's set that aside. Let's assume that the power given to the President as Commander in Chief is nothing more than titular. It is just simply a title. It is a phrase that means nothing. It grants no power. It just simply says the President of the United States is the titular head of the Army, but there are no powers that go with the title of `Commander,' or the role of `Commander'--that all powers are vested in the Congress. 
Let's say that the courts interpret the Constitution to clearly mean that Congress makes decisions on how troops are deployed, where they fight, whom they fight, how they fight, how many infantry are needed, how many tanks are needed--make the military strategy decisions. It is inconceivable to this Senator that our Founding Fathers thought that would be a power delegated to the Congress, but let's assume that it was. Would we want to do that? Would we want to put ourselves in the place of a military 
commander, with his training and years of experience, honed through hard experience in many cases, to make a decision about how we protect those forces and how we deploy those forces? It just seems it would be perhaps the most unwise thing Congress could ever do. Who would ever want to take on that responsibility? Which one of us would want to say that, for the protection of our forces deployed overseas in a hostile environment, we should be the ones to make the determination about how many troops are necessary to protect those forces, what weapons are necessary to protect those forces, what enablers are necessary to protect those forces? I am not sure any of us would want to do that, even if we did have the power. 
But that is a debate that I think we will have again. The amendment before us is not the Byrd-Hutchison amendment, which this Senator supports parts of but not all of, because I think it dictates a specific force level inappropriately and I don't think that is something that we ought to do. 
But the amendment that is before us is one that I think is supported by most Members. It simply says that we want to advise the President that we don't think an indefinite troop deployment in Bosnia. We want the President to understand, the Congress is not going to continue to support that policy. But the decision that vests with us is whether or not to pay for it. That is the power given to us under the Constitution. And, to echo the words of Senator McCain from Arizona, if you want the troops out of Bosnia, cut off the funds. That is our responsibility. But if you are going to appropriate the funds, let's let the Commander in Chief and the people he designates as leaders of those troops make decisions as to how those troops are deployed and at what levels they are deployed, and not have the Congress dictate force levels. 
So, I agree with the Senator from West Virginia. We ought to follow our constitutional responsibility. That constitutional responsibility is to vote on the appropriations, yea or nay. That is the honest, straight-up vote. That is the debate we ought to be having. In the meantime, we would like to send a message to the President of the United States. That is what a sense of the Congress is. The message that we would like to send to the President of the United States is: Mr. President, we are concerned that we are looking at an indefinite troop deployment at considerable cost to the taxpayer in Bosnia, and we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Because of that, we are just giving you a warning flag. 
We are not going to continue to appropriate funds for this unless we have some idea of how we are going to get out of this morass and whether or not this is achieving the goals that have been set out. 
So, therefore, we would like you, understanding that message, to begin consultations with our NATO allies and European friends and begin the process of telling them, `You can't count on us indefinitely. We need to move toward a European force. Now, we will provide support for you, but we are not going to provide combat troops on the ground much longer. So let's move forward with this process.' 
That is the amendment that is before us. I think it is a message that needs to be sent. We can have debate on whether or not Congress has the power or whether or not it is even wise for Congress to get into the specifics of how troops are used once they are there. We will have that debate at another time. 
Madam President, I don't know that there is any further debate on this particular amendment. It does not mean we can't further debate on Bosnia or another amendment, but if there is no further debate on this particular amendment, we need to voice vote the McCain second-degree amendment and then have a recorded vote on the underlying amendment. I do, however, see the Senator from New Hampshire on his feet, as well as the Senator from South Carolina.

The reason for that is that many Senators had been told that there would be a vote at 8. They have planned their schedules accordingly. If we can agree to this now with an additional hour of debate equally controlled by the two Senators, we can then schedule that vote for 8 o'clock.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to speak now. I have been off the floor, and I have another commitment, but I wanted to come and offer my support to his amendment. 
I struggled with this issue when I was, first, ranking member and then chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. I visited most of the training facilities for the various services around the country. I talked to those in charge. We held hearings on the issue. We heard from the experts. We talked to those who lived with the situation in their basic training. It is my inescapable conclusion that the Kassebaum commission did a good job in sorting this out and producing a report which called for separate facilities. 
I, frankly, was surprised with the conclusion of the commission. I didn't think when it was constituted that the commission would come to that conclusion. It was something that I was strongly leaning toward, and all the visits that I made and the people I discussed this issue with seemed to indicate that separate barracks was the direction to go. 
When the commission came forth with this recommendation after a more thorough look than I was able to give, I thought this added a lot of weight to the question. There is no doubt in my mind that effective training and effective gender integration of the armed services can be accomplished without the necessity of forcing the issue through gender integration within the living facilities. 
Obviously, they are going to train together. Obviously, they are going to go to class together, they are going to go to the range together, they are going to train together. The essential functions that are attempting to be accomplished in basic training are going to be accomplished. The real question here is when the training day is done and you return to the barracks to unwind, to shower, to prepare in the evening for the next day and to sleep, is it best to do that in gender separate facilities? I believe it is. This where the issue is. 
I have talked to a lot of drill sergeants, men and women; I have talked to a lot of men and women soldiers, trainees; and the inescapable conclusion that I have reached, and I think most of them have reached, is that it would be much more comfortable without degrading the training, and it would eliminate a lot of the supervisory problems, management problems, and, frankly, the social problems that exist with living at too close quarters. 
For that reason, I think the conclusions of the Kassebaum commission are correct. I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas is the right way to go. 
I was concerned about the costs. That is a legitimate question, as to whether or not separate facilities or separate barracks--in other words, taking a single entity and dividing it and controlling access, and so forth, to separate the sexes, versus separate buildings. 
And I was really persuaded. I knew ultimately, based on my visit to Parris Island with the Marines who already do this, that separate housing was the right policy. At Parris Island, the women live in a separate compound. And virtually, to a person, they told me--including their drill instructors and their supervisors--they told me they strongly preferred that. They are able to identify with each other. And to identify with their female drill instructors was very important to them. 
Many of them come from backgrounds where self-esteem is the casualty of their upbringing. They find that bonding with each other, the bonding that takes place with the drill instructors and their supervisors in those off-hours, the social interaction that takes place in those off-hours, is a very, very important part of their development, the character development, and a whole number of other areas. 
And so I think this makes sense. I am convinced we have looked at the situation. I am convinced we can do this in a financially feasible way. 
I see my time has expired. And I am happy to support the amendment of the Senator from Kansas.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the amendment from the Senator from Wisconsin directs a study of the F/A-18E/F program. I recommended that we accept his amendment as a courtesy, and to move the Defense Authorization Bill along. Accepting the amendment in no way diminishes the committee's support for the program and its demonstrated performance in over 2,900 hours of test flying. 
Mr. President, the F/A-18E/F program has a history of providing audit agencies with unlimited access to all personnel and data required. The F/A-18E/F program is now entering its last year of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). The development program continues its unprecedented success: on schedule, on cost, and meeting or exceeding specified performance. Approximately 70% of the EMD flight test program is complete. Besides successful developmental tests, three successful Operational Testing periods were completed between January 1996 and March 1998. 
The Department of Defense has a structured process for providing oversight on acquisition programs. The process includes Working Level Integrated Product Teams (WLIPTs), Integrated Integrating Product Teams (IIPT) and Overarching Integrated Product Teams (OIPTs). These teams, made up of members from the Navy, Joint Chiefs of Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense staffs, have worked well to keep Defense Department leadership, as well as Congress, apprised of the progress.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the defense authorization bill. Currently pending to that bill is a Hutchinson amendment relating to China. It is expected that a tabling motion will be made on that amendment at approximately 10:15 a.m. this morning. Further votes could occur with respect to the defense bill prior to the 12:30 policy luncheon recess. Under a previous order, following the party lunches at 2:15, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the defense bill. Members are reminded that under rule XXII they have until 12:30 p.m. today to file second-degree amendments to the defense bill. 
The leader would like to remind all Members that there are only 4 days left before the Independence Day recess. There are still several important items to be considered this week, including appropriations bills, the conference reports accompanying the Coverdell education bill, the IRS reform bill, the Higher Education Act, and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action also may be considered this week. Therefore, the cooperation of all Members will be needed to successfully complete the Senate's work this week. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last year DOD had an initiative to have NATO adopt the JSTARS system as the NATO alliance ground surveillance system, but NATO subsequently decided not to acquire the B-707-based US JSTARS aircraft. 
After that decision, the US offered a concept to integrate a variant of the US JSTARS Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) sensor into an aircraft of NATO's choice. In April, NATO's Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) approved a one year concept definition study to flesh out this alternative. However, the April decision was too late to affect the budget request, so that unless the Department gets the authority that would be provided by this amendment, the concept definition effort would slip by a year.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this amendment allows for the inclusion of budget authority to continue work on the expeditionary common automatic recovery system (ECARS), which is a launch and recovery system that DoD is using for unmanned aerial vehicles. ECARS would be an adaptation of that system to provide a landing system for Marine Corps helicopters in places where the Marines have not had an opportunity to establish the full air control system. 
The K-band testing obscuration pairing system (K-TOPS) program would provide a training scoring system to allow the Marines to conduct realistic training in the presence of smoke or other obscurants on a simulated battlefield. Since these programs are for the Marine Corps, the source of budget authority for them is in the communications and infrastructure support program contained in the Procurement, Marine Corps (PMC) account.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will shortly be sending an amendment to the desk. Let me just explain to my colleagues what it is I am attempting to do. 
This is not the first time I have been on the floor of the Senate talking `trash,' not the kind of trash that immediately comes to mind when you use that phrase but trash meaning garbage. In fact, another Senator just came by a few minutes ago and said, `This amendment you are offering is garbage.' I said, `You are exactly right; it is garbage.' It is all about garbage. It is all about municipal solid waste, which is a diplomatic term for garbage, the stuff that each of us throws out every day from our kitchen--puts in a plastic bag, puts out at the curb once or twice a week, picked up by a local truck and taken to what we think is a local landfill nearby. 
Unfortunately, the State I come from, Indiana, has become the local landfill for a number of States that do not have enough landfill capacity or find it cheaper to load it on a train, load it on a truck, send it overnight down our Nation's railways or highways, and drop it off in the State of Indiana. Over the past several years, we have been the recipient of millions upon millions upon millions of tons of out-of-State trash without any ability as a State to put reasonable restraints and restrictions on receipt of that out-of-State trash in order to manage our environment and manage our own destiny in terms of how we dispose of this municipal solid waste. 
The Supreme Court has denied States their individual efforts to regulate this, saying that it is a violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. But the courts have also been clear to point out the fact that if Congress affirmatively enacts legislation or constraints on the importation of out-of-State trash, or exportation of out-of-State trash, it will be constitutionally acceptable. It is just simply one of those areas where States cannot do it individually but Congress can give them the authority to do that. 
We have learned a lot of things over the last several years. I have offered this legislation now five times. This is the sixth. We offered it in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, and in 1996, and in each of those years the Senate has passed this legislation. We now come here for the sixth time because we have been unable to secure passage in the other House, or, when we have, it has been dropped in conference. Various other means have been used to defeat the purpose of finally accomplishing what I believe is a reasonable restraint and reasonable solution to the problem that we face. 
Now, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls have won six titles. This is my sixth try to win one. I have five defeats, and I hope not to get the sixth defeat. So that we have Jordan and the Bulls on the one hand carrying around the trophy with astounding success, and we have Coats on the other hand loaded up with bags of trash brought in from out of State marked X defeat in 1990; X defeat in 1992; X defeat in 1994, et cetera, et cetera. 
Now, I cannot blame my colleagues in the Senate. I cannot do that because through negotiation each time we have been able to work out our differences. We have been able to recognize that there are exporting States that have needs and there are importing States that have problems, and that finding a solution that merely benefits the importing States puts the exporting States in a very difficult position. 
So with the help of my friend from New York, Senator D'Amato, and the help of my friends, on a bipartisan basis we have been able 
to reach an accommodation which recognizes the need for importing States to have to have reasonable restraints on the amount that they can handle and at the same time gives those exporting States time to put in place mechanisms of their own to deal with their trash or to enter into arrangements with our State so that we can have some type of reasonable control over that. 
We have learned those lessons, sometimes the hard way, but we have always been able to reach an agreement and a consensus, and the Senate has been tremendously supportive in the end of my efforts to do this. I am disappointed that we have not had that same kind of support in the House of Representatives. I hope we can as we try once again to convince our colleagues that this is a problem that needs a solution, that we have a solution that takes care of the problems that are facing importing States as well as exporting States. 
The amendment I am going to offer today is the interstate solid waste title of S. 534, which passed twice in the last Congress. That title was carefully negotiated. What we are offering is that title in its entirety with a minor modification. We are even now negotiating that modification as I speak. 
Specifically, to repeat what I have said on this floor many times, this amendment will allow a Governor, if requested by an affected local community, to ban out-of-State solid waste at landfills or incinerators that did not receive out-of-State municipal solid waste in 1993, a benchmark year. 
Let me repeat that because it is a critical point to understand. A Governor is given the authority to ban receipt of out-of-State waste at a landfill that did not receive out-of-State waste in 1993 if, and only if, it is requested by the local community. If the local community wants to receive the out-of-State waste, if they want to enter into a contract with a hauler or the State wants to enter into a contract with another State, they are permitted to do so. The Governor only has the authority if the community asks him to do so and if they meet the test in terms of whether or not they received the waste in 1993. The Governor is also given the authority to freeze, not eliminate but freeze, out-of-State municipal solid waste at 1993 levels at landfills and incinerators that received solid waste during 1993. The Governor, however, may not ban or limit municipal solid waste imports to landfills or incinerators if they have what is called a host community agreement that specifically authorizes out-of-State waste. So if a community wants it, fine. But if a community feels it is overwhelmed and cannot receive it, then it can request the Governor to either ban or freeze, depending on the particular situation that exists. 
Just as an example of this, we have small communities, small counties, in Indiana with landfills that were designed to serve the solid waste needs of those communities within that jurisdiction, say, for a 20- or 25-year period of time. They have gone out on a limb with a bond issue or they have come up with the financing to finance this landfill, and they suddenly find that in the period of 12 months or 18 months the entire landfill is filled to capacity, leaving the solid waste jurisdiction in dire straits, no longer able to take care of their own generated municipal solid waste simply because their landfill was clogged up and filled up with waste coming not from their area, not even within their State, but sometimes long hauled halfway across the country or brought down from another State so it is totally out of their control. 
Since we started offering this amendment, shipments across the borders have continued. Large importers continue to be adversely impacted. We have been a net importer in the State of Indiana for over 7 years. In 1996, we imported 1.8 million tons of out-of-State trash. Last year, we received the largest amount ever, 2.7 million tons. From 1996 to 1997, our trash imports have increased by 37 percent and our hands are tied. We cannot control what comes across our borders and into our landfills unless we have legislation that gives us the authority to do that. 
I do not want to take a lot of time; I know we are trying to move this bill along. Let me just conclude by saying I am not arguing for an outright ban on all waste shipments between States. There are examples of effective and efficient cross-border waste management. My own State of Indiana has several communities which have traditionally worked with other communities in neighboring States to receive solid waste. 
But we must give States some role in making waste management decisions. Without congressional authority, we will be unable to play any role whatsoever. 
We must have a say in how much we receive. We must have the ability to enter into contracts. We do have to recognize the needs of exporting States, but we also have to balance those needs with importing States. We have legislation, which this Senate has passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis, with exporters and importers agreeing that this is a proper balance. I am simply reintroducing what has already been accepted by this Senate with, as I said, a modest modification that even at this point we are discussing with export States to see if we can reach some agreement on that so this legislation can go forward.

Mr. COATS. I would hope we could. I talked to the Senator from New York, indicating we are flexible in terms of moving this on. I agree with the Senator there may be some need to have additional negotiations. Since the Senate passed this before and this language has been acceptable, we could agree to go back to the original ratchet, the original number used as the baseline for ratcheting down. We dropped it 100,000 tons--we could go back to the 750,000, if that would be acceptable and allow us to go forward with this. There is no way we can, I believe, derive an answer to the Senator's second question, 
which is using 1999 as a different base than 1993. 
I assumed all along, based on the assurances given to us by the Senator from New York and other exporting States in the past, that development of in-State facilities was accommodating more and more of their municipal waste. In fact, I was assured of that several years ago. If they just had a 2-, 3-, 4-year flexibility, they would have their own in-State capacity or at least have the capacity that would allow them not to significantly increase the exports. 
I think we can work that out. I would like, obviously, to move this along and pass the bill. We all know it is a long way from ever getting to conference because of concerns in the House on other issues. But if there is any way the Senator from New York can see to, one, agree to our offer to go back to the original figure on the ratchet basis from 650,000 to 750,000 and then my assurances that we will work with him and work with Members of the House and his delegation to address this other question--which I don't think we have the answer to at this point and can't get it in the short amount of time that the chairman wants to move this appropriations bill--I am certainly open to that.

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from New York, I will state a couple of things. 
No. 1, we passed this legislation in 1996. So the agreement that we had reached relative to using 1993 was acceptable to the State of New York, the State of New Jersey, and other exporters just in the last Congress. In fact, we passed it twice in the last Congress. There was no request at that time, in 1996, to change the base year from--in fact, we offered 1993 or 1994, and 1993 was a more acceptable year--there was no request then to address the concern that the Senator from New York has just raised relative to having to change that base year to accommodate what might be perceived as increased exports. 
Secondly, I will state again for the Record that we have been repeatedly assured by exporters--by exporting States that all they needed was a little bit of time to develop more of their own capacity and that actually I think it would be just as logical a request from the Senator from Indiana or anybody from an importing State to request that we use a lower amount rather than a higher amount, because 10 years ago everybody said, this won't be a problem; 10 years ago, people said 5 years from then it wouldn't be a problem, because all they needed was 3 or 4 years to sort of get their own act together. 
We understood that, and we understood the prodigious volumes of municipal waste they were generating. The population in the Senator's State I don't believe has significantly increased. In fact, I think they are losing population. 
I don't know that they are necessarily generating more waste, unless people are eating more than they used to. It might be. The economy is good. Maybe there is more waste to dispose of. My daughter has moved to New York, so my wife and I go up and we eat out. I suppose that is out-of-State consumption. We try to eat everything we order, I will state for the record, so that we don't generate any more waste that can be sent back to Indiana. I don't think it is good for the Senator from Indiana to go to New York, generate waste that then is packed up that night and shipped by truck and dumped in my landfill in my hometown. 
I don't understand the need to increase or to look on the assertion or the basis that they have less disposal capacity now than before when we have been assured on the floor that all they needed was just a few years to provide more in-State capacity and that would alleviate our problem. We have made very significant concessions in terms of addressing the concerns of the exporting States. 
My original legislation that I offered back in 1990 gave the Governor the outright authority to flat out ban any garbage from out of State. And that passed the U.S. Senate. 
We have the votes to do that. There are about 31 States that are importers. They are the ones that get dumped on. There are just a handful of States that generate the exports. But we recognize that problem. They are high-density States and generate a lot of waste. 
We recognized their problem. And we address their problem. And, in so doing, we made considerable concessions about what we would continue to receive, that if a community or a municipal waste disposal jurisdiction wanted to take out-of-State waste, enter into a contract to do that, why, we would allow that to take place. We said the Governor could not outright ban; he could only freeze at certain levels. 
We adjusted the baseline amounts so that we would continue to receive prodigious amounts of waste--all trying to be a good neighbor, trying to help out a State until they could develop their own disposal capacity. 
Now, New York is a big State. There is a lot of room in New York to put--a lot bigger than the State of Indiana. I just assumed----

Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield in a moment. 
I just assumed the State of New York was taking advantage of some of that space outside of Manhattan to address those needs and by now we would not even need to be here addressing this. But something has not happened; therefore, I think to go back to the original agreement that gives States some authority to make reasonable rules relative to how much they receive and so that they can manage their own environmental affairs, something that has been approved and accepted by every Member in this body in the past, I think that is a reasonable way to proceed. 
I just answer the Senator from New York by saying, I think it would be just as reasonable if I were here asking for lower baseline numbers rather than higher, but I am willing to stay where we were because that is what we worked so hard to agree on just in the last Congress.

Mr. COATS. Well, let me say this to the Senator. First of all, I know that, given the 4 weeks we spent on the tobacco legislation, things are desperately behind. We are desperately behind the curve, and I know the Senate is anxious to move this appropriations bill forward as well as the agriculture appropriations, which I believe is coming next. 
In the interest of expediting that schedule, I would be willing to accept that change offered by the Senator from New York if it would allow us to move forward, and with the understanding that we have a mutual agreement here to sit down and try to work this out.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I had a discussion earlier with the Senator from New Mexico. I had a discussion with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I told the Senator from New Mexico that it is not my intention to bog down this bill. I understand the dilemma the Senate is in due to the 4 weeks we spent on the tobacco bill without resolution. We have appropriations bills that need to move. 
I assured the Senator from New Mexico that it was not my intent to do this. I was operating on the assumption that the agreement that we so torturously reached in 1996, that received the unanimous support of every Senator, including the Senators from New York and the Senators from New Jersey, including the Senators from Illinois and exporting States, after days and weeks and months of negotiations, that that would still be operative. 
Now it seems that everything has changed. I am not going to insist on my rights to allow this amendment to tie up this appropriations bill. I think there is important work in the Senate that needs to be done. I will just say to my fellow Senators, this is an issue that is not going to go away. I said it in 1990. I have said it every year since. It has passed the Senate five times, sometimes by unanimous consent, sometimes by 94 votes. 
Importing States are at a tremendous disadvantage, and they have no say in the ways in which they can manage their own environmental destiny as it regards municipal solid waste. Exporting States can continue to make promises about what they are going to do. The fact of the matter is they apparently are not delivering on those promises. We were assured time after time that if they just bought a little more time, they would achieve the capacity necessary to deal with their own waste, but they found it convenient to ship it somewhere else so that somebody else can deal with their problems. 
It appears now that the evidence is in that they are not doing anything to deal with their own waste, and that puts those of us who are importing States at a great disadvantage. By the way, that is 31 States. 
We agreed we are going to continue to work on this. We will continue to work on this. We will attempt to achieve another consensus so that we can move this legislation, but, in the meantime, I think it is important that we go ahead with other work in the Senate that has been planned. 
With that in mind, I withdraw my amendment.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize Robert Mohr of Peru, Indiana, for his outstanding accomplishment this past week. 
You see, Mr. President, on May 12, 1998, Mr. Mohr, a conductor for Norfolk Southern railroad, and engineer Rod Lindley were guiding their 96-car freight train through a residential area of Lafayette, Indiana, when they noticed a small child on the train tracks. With only a short distance between the train and the child, these men slowed the train to 10 mph and blasted the horn, but 19-month-old Emily Marshall still remained on the tracks. 
Robert Mohr acted immediately and selflessly. Risking his own safety, he climbed onto the front of the train, reached out, and pushed the toddler out of harm's way. Thanks to Robert's quick reaction, Emily Marshall was returned to her family with only a cut on her head and a swollen lip. 
Mr. President, I commend Robert Mohr for this brave and selfless act, and that is why I am honoring him as a Hoosier Hero. 
I began the Hoosier Hero award in order to single out Hoosier men and women who have made significant contributions to Indiana history or life, while at the same time serving as an inspirational example for the entire nation. I can think of no greater contribution to life than preserving the life of a small child, such as young Emily. 
Emily Marshall, an innocent toddler who wandered onto the train tracks, will probably not realize for several years what Robert Mohr did for her. However, through Robert Mohr's courageous act, Emily now has the opportunity to grow healthy and strong. Emily's future is a bright one, full of promise because of the heroic decision Robert made on that spring afternoon. 
Thank you, Robert Mohr, for your courage, your bravery, and your selfless act of saving the life of young Emily Marshall. You are an inspiration to all, a true Hoosier Hero.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his recognition. 
I want to also thank Senator Levin for the kind remarks he made about my service on the committee. It has truly been an honor for me and a privilege to serve for 10 years on the Armed Services Committee. I say without reservation that my service on that committee is the most enjoyable aspect of anything I have done in the U.S. Senate. It is a truly bipartisan committee working for one purpose: To strengthen our Armed Forces, and to strengthen our national security, and to provide our men and women in uniform with the very best that we can under obviously difficult budget conditions. 
It is the first responsibility of government to provide for the common defense. We are proud of the work that our men and women in uniform have done--their dedication, their commitment, their sacrifice, their loyalty, their duty, their honor--all virtues which are in short supply in this country today. There are few institutions left that honor those virtues. The military is one of them. 
It has been a great pleasure for me over the past 10 years to be a part of that, to help shape those forces to address the needs and concerns, to look to the future to see what is needed, and to hopefully put in place those programs and policies that will address those needs in the future. It has not been easy. 
The decade of the 1980s was clearly a great time to be serving on that committee. We had a challenging and important time. We had a demonstrated need. We had a demonstrated bipartisan commitment to address that need, and we had the resources to accomplish that. It all culminated in the most extraordinary and outstanding victory in the history of warfare. The United States' and the allies' performance in Desert Shield and Desert Storm was revolutionary in terms of the way warfare is dictated. 
I will never forget the debate that we had both in committee and on the floor regarding what our participation should be in that situation, and the authorization for use of force, if necessary. Those were difficult times. We feared significant loss of life. And yet, the magnificent synergy of quality personnel, quality leadership, quality weapons, quality training, doctrine and command resulted in something that was truly extraordinary: A decisive victory in a very short period of time with minimal loss of life and injury--creating a dominant military the world has seldom witnessed in its history. 
However, that was the culmination of the decade of the 1980s. Those were decisions that were made during the 1980s in terms of how we structure our forces, what kind of training and equipment we provide them, how we develop our leadership, and how we bring all of that together. The 1990s have been a different story. It has been a time of budget constraints. It has been a time of very significant cutbacks, a time of rejoicing over the fall of the Berlin Wall, over the fall of the Iron Curtain, the demise of a nuclear superpower that was challenging us for world superiority, not that we were looking for that, but that it was a triumph of an idea, a triumph of an idea of freedom, the concept of freedom, and an economic concept of free enterprise over totalitarianism and Marxism. That, obviously, led to major changes in the way we structured our defense. 
The decade of the 1990s has been a transition period, a period in which budget limitations have driven very significant changes, a period in which the Department of Defense has contributed more to the elimination of deficit spending than perhaps all of the other aspects of Government combined. The little-told story about why we now have a surplus with our budget, why we have been able to control Government spending, is the contribution of the Department of Defense to that achievement. That contribution has overwhelmed all other contributions put together. The roughly 30-percent to 40-percent declines in spending in real dollars, the substantial downsizing of the military, the substantial downsizing in procurement, the substantial savings that have been achieved over what we would have had to spend had we maintained our military defense spending at the level of the 1980s, has made the most significant contribution to deficit reduction. And we shouldn't forget that fact. That has happened with a truly bipartisan effort. 
So it has been a joy for me to work with my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, on these issues. Have we had differences of opinion? Yes. Have we had difficult debates? Closed-door debates? Yes. But in the end we have always forged a consensus, and we have done so because foremost in our minds was providing for the common defense in an effective way and looking out for the needs and the interests of our service personnel. 
Mr. President, let me just briefly comment on the fiscal year 1999 defense authorization bill that has just come out of committee and that we are addressing here on the floor. First of all, I want to start with quality of life and briefly touch on that. 
I served for 4 years as ranking member and 2 years as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. 
While I still serve on that committee, I no longer am chairman. I will leave much of the details of what that committee has done to Senator Kempthorne and the ranking member. However, I view this as the No. 1 priority of the committee in establishing our budget because no weapon, no doctrine, no training manual, nothing can take the place of quality personnel. And so our goal has been to attract the very best we can, to retain those personnel, and to provide them with the essentials of what they need, and to provide for them a standard of living that is commensurate with their sacrifice. 
Let me say that no standard of living that we can provide is commensurate with the kind of hours and the kind of sacrifice and the kind of commitments that are made by our military personnel, but we try to do the best we can. Over the years they have been shortchanged in terms of housing. They have been shortchanged in terms of pay. And they have been shortchanged in terms of benefits. We have tried to make up for some of that. It is certainly better than it was but nowhere equal to the kind of commitment and the demands that we ask of our military personnel. Yet, day after day, year after year, they continue to provide the kind of effort and the kind of service that is unheard of in the private sector, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude as a Nation. It means that we need to keep their pay consistent with pay on the outside. 
Today, we are attempting to attract people who are skilled in technical areas, who have the capacity and the capability and the training and the experience to employ today's modern military equipment using today's advanced operational concepts. It is not just simply foot soldiers carrying heavy loads, walking through the mud, although that will always be an essential part of our military as it needs to be. But it is that foot soldiers and everyone else involved in our military are today operating very sophisticated, modern equipment. They need to think on their feet. They need to have capabilities in terms of information processing, in terms of utilizing the latest in technologies, in weapons and computers and information sources that are commensurate with what is needed in the private sector. 
And so we have to have the incentives in place, and pay in place to allow us to compete, and to attract and to retain these personnel. 
In that regard, we have provided in this bill a 3.1-percent pay raise for military personnel. We also provide an increase of $500 million in military construction projects, $164 million of which will fund barracks, dining facilities, and military housing. If there is a shortfall in terms of what we have done for our troops over the years, it is military housing. Much of it, nearly two-thirds of military housing is substandard, substandard by military code, military, not commercial standards --and the military standards in many cases are not up to the same level as private standards--and yet year after year we ask our military families to live in this housing. It is inadequate housing, it is substandard housing, and they do so without complaint. We owe it to them, to the single soldiers and airmen and marines, men and women, and to their families. We owe it to them to give them affordable, decent housing. 
We are underway with an initiative that was started by Secretary Perry to, in many cases, privatize or leverage the ability of the Department of Defense to utilize private contractors to provide military housing in arrangements which allow us to make maximum use of the funds we have, to leverage those funds in the way that the private sector leverages their money to address this housing shortfall, and so we are underway with that. 
Health care is another major issue. I won't go into that. I will let Senator Kempthorne address that. This is a major concern of our military personnel, something that needs to be addressed. We are in the transition period with that also, and there are many questions that need to be answered. We attempt to do some of that in this bill including the direction of three health care 
demonstrations for our military retirees who are Medicare eligible: one related to FEHBP; one related to TRICARE; and one related to mail order pharmacy benefits. I support these initiatives, but more needs to be done. 
Let me now talk about readiness. The bill also adds over $400 million to the readiness account levels requested in the President s budget for our Active and Reserve Forces. We are all aware of the demand on readiness with our commitments overseas--Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, to name just two, and there are many, many more. These are stretching our capacity. These are costly. They affect our readiness and our ability to sustain the preparedness of the force. And we need to understand that this is a major concern which should be continually monitored and addressed by the Congress. 
I want to focus most of my comments, though, Mr. President, on the modernization question. For years we have deferred modernization of our weapons systems and of our equipment--trucks, radios, and basic equipment. We have deferred that modernization because we have not had the resources available to fund quality of life, readiness, all other aspects of our national defense such as research and development, as well as the modernization of weapon platforms and systems. 
Now, this underfunding of modernization was done with the understanding that by fiscal year 1998, which we are now in, and we are dealing with the 1999 fiscal year with this budget, we will have ended this pause where we have downsized our modernization spending by as much as 70 percent over previous levels. And the understanding, the promise, was that this administration would bring procurement back to at least a $60 billion a year procurement level in fiscal year 1998 in order to replace aging tanks, aging planes, and aging equipment. This is what was originally programmed and projected. Not all of us thought that was attainable. We thought that we were doing less than we should. We were able to secure some funds to plus-up some of that modernization in the past but at levels far below what was recommended to us by experts outside the military and by military personnel who were looking at this question. 
Well, here we are with an increased modernization budget but still at a $50 billion level, not the $60 billion level we were supposed to have achieved last year. So, again, modernization accounts remain on the margin. We are unable to modernize in a way that we believe is most effective from a cost standpoint and from a requirements standpoint. We have increased procurement in some areas. And I think we appreciate the ability to gain some extra funds for that, but I just want our colleagues to know there is no basis on which to come to this floor and criticize the Armed Services Committee for spending too much on new systems. We are still spending too little on the modernization of our military forces. We are below what the Department of Defense has told us, well below what they have told us is required to replace the aging weapons systems that we currently use, and recapitalize our joint warfighting capabilities. 
Several of these modernization issues come through my committee. I am privileged to chair the Airland Committee. Let me just talk about some of these major procurement items. 
First, the land portion of this--land power. The committee has held hearings on land power, and we are pleased to note that the Marine Corps advances in urban warfare experiments and revolutionary expeditionary capabilities with the MV22 and the AAAV seem to be on schedule. They are important in the future. 
We are also pleased that the Army is moving forward to consolidate gains it has learned from its Force XXI process. And that the Army says it is investigating the transformation to the faster, smaller, more lethal and more deployable force structure it will need in the 21st Century. But the Army's modernization strategy to pursue this modernization is short particularly in some of the less glamorous areas of aviation, armored vehicles, and trucks. The committee has added provisions which address these issues. Again, there is not as much procurement for landpower as we would like, but at least we are moving in the right direction. 
I want to say, Mr. President, that we have also made some very significant progress in this whole question of addressing Reserve component modernization. Thanks to the fine work of Senator Glenn in particular, and committee and staff, we have for the very first time structured what I believe is a coherent process in determining Guard and Reserve procurement. For the first time, the budget request by the Department has included a substantial amount of funds for National Guard and Reserve procurement--a $1.4 billion level, which is a 50-percent increase over last year. Our mark adds to this another $700 million. 
But the important point to note here is that all of the additions that we have added for the Army Guard were requested by the Army Chief of Staff, including Blackhawk helicopters to enhance tactical airlift, new and remanufactured trucks that improve our transportation capabilities and reduce operating costs, and radios that enable the Guard to integrate with the Active Army's tactical internet. Clearly, the Senate's bipartisan efforts in this regard have had a very positive effect on the whole concept of total force integration. 
As we look at limited defense budgets on and over the horizon, and as we look at ways in which we assess the threats of the future, and at our ability to deploy, and at the cost of those overseas deployments, and at our ability to preposition equipment, and at, perhaps, the denial of access to facilities overseas--to landing strips, sea ports, and bases--we need total force integration across our Active Army, and our Army Reserves, and our Army National Guard. And in order to accomplish that, we need to dispense with the former practice of making the Guard and Reserve budget requests a secondary priority to that of the Active Army, but to make them an integral part of the budget request sent over from the Department of Defense. The Department needs to assess what the Reserve components need, and they need to tell us that in the budget request, and then we need to look at that as an integrated requirement, rather than as two separate entities. 
We have begun, under the prodding of the SASC, that process of total force integration and taken a significant step forward this year. I commend the Department for doing that and we need to do more for total force integration in the future. 
Let me talk about TACAIR, tactical aircraft. We have held a number of hearings on TACAIR to assess the status of the F/A18-E/F, Super Hornet and the F-22 Raptor. The Navy and the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation provided their assessment that the Super Hornet's, the F/A18-E/F, the wing-drop and buffeting issues have been fixed, and that the program should proceed with production as planned. This authorization supports those funds requested for the F/A18-E/F. 
These issues with the Super Hornet were not as serious as many had thought. They were, really, reported as being more serious than they were. However, they were issues that needed to be addressed. The Department of the Navy and the contractors have successfully addressed these issues, and I am pleased that the F/A18-E/F program will proceed as planned. 
Now, let me speak about the F-22. Last year I spoke on the floor at length about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and demonstrated performance. And I want to state for the record here, up front, I address these issues as a supporter of F-22 development, not as a critic of the F-22. And I spoke last year because was concerned that if we don't keep our arms around this issue and keep a good, clear oversight of the issue, the F-22 may run into very serious problems in terms of funding and in terms of support for that funding. And I don't want to jeopardize that. Based on the testimony of the Air Force and the assessment of the General Accounting Office and other entities, there are many who share a deep concern over whether or not we can maintain support for the F-22 if costs continue to escalate toward $200 million per aircraft. So we need, and we ask for, adequate demonstration of performance and cost control. 
The bill that is before us authorizes the requested F-22 funding levels. I want to repeat that. The bill before us, for those who are supporters of F-22--and there are many here, because it is a marvelous new leap-ahead technology that is important for our national security and our national defense in the future--many support this marvelous new development in technology that is going to provide the basis for Air Force air dominance capabilities in TACAIR for many, many years in the future. We have authorized every penny that has been requested for next year's budget in order to continue developing the F-22. But we have put some key oversight provisions in place that will help the Congress 
and help the administration keep the program on track. And the reason we have done this is because there is a great deal in jeopardy if we don't do that. 
Several things could happen if we cannot control F-22 costs, none of which are good. One, we could end up treating F-22 as we ended up treating B-2, another leap-ahead technology that provided us with one of the most amazing developments in long-range strategic aircraft that any nation has ever enjoyed. But we ended up producing far fewer than what we had planned because the cost per copy had escalated so high we just simply couldn't afford to produce more. While the threat today doesn't necessarily justify additional B-2s, the threat of tomorrow could and we won't have those planes. We don't want that to happen to the F-22. 
Second, we could lose support for other key systems that are necessary to provide for our future defense needs, such as carriers, Comanche, V-22. We could jeopardize those systems if the cost overruns for F-22 escalate to the point where we are spending more money on that program, and we have to take it from somewhere else. And I am afraid we would have to take it from these key and necessary weapons platforms that we require in the future. 
Or third, we could lose the ability to produce what we need of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Joint Strike Fighter is the complement to the F-22 that is coming on at a later date. It is currently in its early stages of its engineering and manufacturing development, and we could jeopardize this program if F-22 costs grow. The reason why we cannot allow that to happen is that the Navy and the Marines are absolutely depending on the Joint Strike Fighter to provide stealth and to address their other TACAIR needs for the future, just as the Air Force is depending on F-22 to address their needs. 
In fact, the Marine Corps has staked their entire TACAIR future on Joint Strike Fighter. So we have to be careful that we preserve our ability to go forward with the conventional variant, the carrier variant, and the short take-off / vertical land (STO/VL) variant of the JSF. And that is why we have placed some prudent oversight provisions on F-22. 
Here is what we have done and here is why we did it. When we reviewed the F-22 program, the Air Force planned F-22 flight tests beginning in May of 1997 with a contract award for the Lot I production scheduled in June 1999. Lot 1 is the first two production planes, which are followed by a Lot 2 of six aircraft. And this gets a little esoteric here--they planned for that contract award for June of 1999 when there would be 601 hours of flight testing complete, which is 14 percent of the total flight-test program. 
The 14 percent is an important threshold because the Defense Science Board Report of 1995 on the F-22 production noted that most of the `program killer'--how they describe it, `program killer' problems are usually discovered in the first 10 to 20 percent of developmental flight tests. 
Our experience in the past has demonstrated that somewhere in that 10- to 20-percent range we find the kind of problems that can potentially terminate or cause major modifications to the technical specifications of the program that are so significant they don't justify the expense to go forward and fix the problem. You almost have to go back to page 1 of the program, and obviously that puts it in great jeopardy. So we were concerned that before we execute a contract for production, we reach a threshold level of testing, flight testing that would give us some assurance that executing that contract would be wise--a wise business decision, and a decision in the best interests of our taxpayers, but also in line with our defense needs before we executed that contract. 
Unfortunately, this F-22 flight testing program has had to slip. The first flight was nearly 4 months late. Instead of May of 1997, it was in September 1997. Another test flight had to be canceled. To date, only 3 hours of flight time have been accumulated. In addition, the program is experiencing manufacturing delays of up to five months. And we have already had the previous assessment of a Joint Evaluation Team of Air Force and industry experts that concluded the F-22 program would significantly exceed its cost estimates and that it should be restructured to reduce risk. This caused us to reallocate a very significant amount of funds, $2.2 billion, to get the program back on sound footing. 
Yet, despite all these problems, the Air Force wants to move the contract award not back, not to keep it at the same level, but to move it forward 6 months when the program hopes to have only 4 percent of its flight testing 
We have had a lot of debate about this. We have had hearings. We have heard from the contractors. We have heard from the Air Force. We have heard from outside witnesses. We have heard from experts. We have debated among ourselves. And I believe we have reached an acceptable consensus as to how we ought to address this particular problem. 
We need to address it because the obvious answer, the first answer that comes to mind, is, `Well, let's just delay; let's just delay until they get to 14 percent.' I wish it were that easy. Delay means that the prime contractors have to cease a schedule of lining up subcontractors, of establishing production lines, of hiring workers--a myriad of tasks that have to be accomplished, people who have to be hired, procedures that have to be put in place--and that delay costs a great deal of money and can break the production base of the program. 
We have had this very complicated schedule to put together. We are talking about one of the most complex and difficult development processes and production processes that anybody can imagine. This involves a great deal of effort, time, and cost. To delay that incurs considerable risk and considerable cost. 
By the same token, going forward without adequate testing produces a great deal of risk--risk that the F-22 will not turn out as we hope it turns out, risk that the flight testing between the current level, the 4-percent level, or the 14-percent level will turn up something that is a showstopper, that is a `program killer.' So we are trying to balance this risk against the cost of delay. 
In addition to this, there has been a very complex set of negotiations that have taken place with the Air Force and the contractor, in particular, that imposes a fixed-price contract for these initial production aircraft. The Air Force states: `This is all the money you are going to get. No matter what problems come up, we're not going to give you more, so you have to operate under the fixed-price contract.' 
The contractor comes back and says: `Well, if we have to operate under the fixed-price contract, you can't delay the contract, because there is no way we can meet the goal of producing what you want us to produce at the time you want us to produce it under the cost cap that you have imposed on us if you delay the contract and production process.' 
So all of this has to be put into the mix and a decision must be made in terms of how we proceed. 
This is what we decided to do: No. 1, we are going to approve the budget request for the full funding of continued development for the F-22. However, we are going to put what we call a fence--that is, we are going to put some of the what we call long lead money, money that is going to be spent in the future on items that allow us to prepare for production--we are going to put that money in a category which says it will not be released for expenditure until a couple of things happen. 
First of all, I need to point out, we are going to go ahead and produce and buy the Lot I series of F-22 which consists of two aircraft. We are going to keep that on schedule. There are no restraints on that, no holds, no fences, no conditions. This is underway. We need to proceed. We are going to buy those first two planes. 
Lot II consists of the next six planes. What we are going to do is say that advance procurement of lot II F-22s, the next six aircraft, cannot commence until we reach a threshold level of 10 percent of testing, which is the minimum that was specified by the Defense Science Board back in 1995--not the 14 percent, but the 10 percent. Remember, they gave us the range of 10 to 20 percent. We thought 14 percent was an adequate number. We are going to drop that down to 10 percent. That is the minimum. So there is still 
risk, and we are trying to minimize risk and balance risk against cost. 
We are going to fence that money until 10 percent of testing is complete or until the Secretary of Defense certifies to us that a lesser amount of flight testing is sufficient and provides his rationale and analysis for that certification. And we are also requiring the Secretary to certify that it is financially advantageous to proceed to Lot II production, aircraft three through eight, rather than wait for completion of the 10 percent of the currently planned test schedule. 
That last portion is something Senator Levin suggested. The first portion is what I suggested. The two together, I believe, form a good basis for us to impose upon the Secretary of Defense a certification and verification process that provides us the necessary assurance that they have kept their eyes on the program, have determined through testing that if that level is 8, 8 1/2 , 9 or 9 1/2 , that is sufficient. There is no magic to the 10-percent number. Again, it was selected because the Defense Science Board set it as its minimum. However, we have new production techniques, we have new manufacturing processes in place for this plane, which have never been done before. And if we can, through simulation, if we can, through other procedures, determine that we have adequate information relative to the performance and capabilities of this plane to go into production at a lower level of demonstrated performance, then the Secretary can certify that for us. 
He can't do that if the flight testing is less than 4 percent. We have to get to at least that level. Of course, that is the level suggested to us by the Air Force as necessary, and that is the level they currently plan to achieve before contract award. Those are the necessary flight test hours that are required to move up the contract award 6 months. 
Those are the committee's efforts to try to balance risk with excess cost for delay and put in place a process that will give us the opportunity to have the oversight and to force the Secretary of Defense to keep his focus on the F-22 program and on any kind of cost escalation that might jeopardize the program. 
We have reached this accord with the significant help of members on both sides of the committee. The committee was unanimous, Republicans and Democrats--unanimous--that this is the procedure that we ought to put in place. So there is complete bipartisan support for this effort. 
I am urging my colleagues, and I have already had discussions with some of our House colleagues about why this is important. This should not be an item for compromise. We have made some very, very tough decisions here. 
Mr. President, in moving away from TACAIR, let me talk for a moment about defense transformation, something Senator Lieberman and I have worked on diligently in the past several years. I am pleased he has joined me on the floor, and I know we will hear from him about this when I am finished. 
Defense transformation is, I think, a necessary process to address the threats of the future and to have the capability to deal with those threats. What happens under defense transformation will bear fruit 10 or 15 or 20 or more years from now. Just as the astounding success of Desert Storm was the result of decisions made in the late seventies and throughout the eighties, the successes that we can achieve in addressing threats of the future in the year 2014 or the year 2020 or beyond will be determined by the decisions that are made today, and in 2001, and 2003, and 2007. 
Those decisions--in terms of the kind of platforms and equipment that we purchase, in terms of the kind of doctrine that we develop to address those new threats, in terms of the kind of forces that we structure, in terms of the kind of assessments that we make of those threats and the response to those threats --those decisions will be made now and in the next several years. And we will understand the significance of that well beyond the time that most of us will still be in the U.S. Senate. 
But we owe it to the future--just as those who made the decisions in the late 1970s and in the 1980s provided for the future success of our national defense strategy in the late 1980s and 1990s--we owe it to the future and future generations to make the right decisions now. 
We know that the threats of the future will be different than the threats of the past. Few, if any, tyrants or dictators or world leaders will ever again amass forces in a desert situation and line them up in traditional warfare and take on the capabilities that the United States demonstrated during the Gulf War. 
No dictator is going to pour tens and hundreds of billions of dollars into building the kind of defense structure that the United States annihilated in Desert Storm. They are going to be looking at different types of threats, threats that we call asymmetric, not what is typical, not what we expect, not the war of the past, but the war of the future. 
Historians will tell you that those who fight wars based on the last war lose the next war--because their adversaries are always adjusting, always evaluating and transforming. We saw that with Blitzkrieg; we saw that in naval aviation and a number of ways throughout history. The last thing we want to do is maintain the status quo, because the status quo will not be adequate to address threats of the future. So defense transformation is necessary. It is necessary to prepare us for the future. But how do we transform our military capabilities? 
The Armed Services Committee has focused on this issue. A couple of years ago we authorized what we call the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). It simply means once every 4 years there is a review of the threats, and the processes and capabilities we have put in place as the means by which we address those threats. This QDR was an internal process. It was a process that takes place within the Department of Defense. 
We believe there needs to be an ongoing, continuing process, a continual update and assessment of the threat, and how we address that threat, and what changes need to be made, and what structures need to be imposed in order to successfully address those threats in the future. 
With that, we combined the QDR with a process which we labeled the National Defense Panel (NDP). It was a selection of outside experts who took a look at the same situation, a second opinion, if you will. Faced with a serious disease, people should--and I think in most cases do--get a second opinion. We don't just go to the very first doctor and say, `Well, that sounds good. Let's go ahead.' And we should treat our national security the same way. `This is so serious, potentially life threatening, I want a second opinion before I make a decision.' The NDP was our second opinion, but it was an outside opinion. 
We worked closely with Secretary Perry, Deputy Secretary White, and others to fashion how we select these individuals for the NDP, and how we put this process together. It was led by Phil Odeen, chairman of the National Defense Panel, and with distinguished and recognized outside thinkers, experts, and experienced people with military background and training. 
That panel produced an extraordinary report which ought to be one of the blueprints for the future. We have combined this external NDP process with the internal QDR process to try to lay out an assessments of where we are, where we are going, and how we will get there. Our defense authorization bill this year includes a sense of the Congress on a key process at the foundation of 
fulfilling some of these requirements--the designation of a combatant commander who has the mission of developing, preparing, conducting, and assessing a process of joint warfare experimentation. 
This joint warfighting experimentation is at the foundation of this whole defense transformation. Basically, what this process says is that before we rush into what Senator Coats or Senator Lieberman or the Armed Services Committee, or even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the Secretary of Defense, thinks is the direction we ought to go, let us test it, let us test some ideas, let us experiment, let us look at how we develop all of this, let us take the good ideas and throw out the bad, let us not just commit to something that turns out 4 or 5 years from now to be the wrong item or the wrong direction. 
Secretary Cohen is reviewing currently, for his signature, a charter which would assign the mission of joint warfighting experimentation to a combatant commander, the Commander in Chief of US Atlantic Command (USACOM) in Norfolk. We have met with Secretary Cohen. And we met with General Shelton and Admiral Gehman, the CINC of USACOM. They have worked with us to craft this language. We have their full support. 
We are not going forward here thinking that we know all the answers to these issues. We are not the experts. We have some ideas and we would like to move them forward. And we have bounced them off the Department. And we have worked together. And we have structured something which we agree on. I visited USACOM. I visited their joint training and simulation center, and their joint battle lab. And I can report, Mr. President, that progress is being made to develop the foundation for this joint experimentation process. 
The Senate, I believe, has been keenly aware of the need to transform our military capabilities to address the potentially very different challenges we are going to face in the future. The National Defense Panel report argues that these challenges--which include things such as challenges in power projection, information operations, and weapons of mass destruction--can place our security at far greater risk than what we face today. 
Correspondingly, the NDP recommended establishing this combatant command which will drive the transformation of our military capabilities through this process of joint experimentation. The NDP testified that the need for this joint experimentation process is `absolutely critical' and `urgent.' I am pleased that the Department of Defense has been so cooperative in working with us in helping to establish this new mission for a command and this new process. The resounding consensus from several hearings on defense transformation that we have held in the committee support the combination of joint and service experimentation as the foundation for the transformation of military capabilities to address the operational challenges of the future. 
So we are taking joint and service experimentation, and combining our efforts, those best efforts and forces of our services and of our unified commanders, along with individual service experimentation initiatives--Force XXI, Sea Dragon--and a whole number of other joint and individual service processes, and looking at ways in which we take the very best insights as the basis for developing our capabilities for the future. 
This process of experimentation is designed to investigate the co-evolution of advances in technology, with changes in the organizational structure of our forces, and with the development of new operational concepts. The purpose of joint experimentation is to determine those technologies, those organizations, and those concepts which will provide a leap-ahead in joint warfighting capability. Just as we are looking to leap-ahead technologies in platforms, aircraft carriers, joint strike fighters, et cetera, we are looking for leap-ahead development in concepts, and in doctrine, and in force structure. 
As I said earlier, it is just as important to select winners as it is to determine losers. Under joint experimentation, failure can be a virtue. We know everything will not be a success. We do not want to reward failure, but we want to recognize failure as important to determining what works and what does not. The worst thing we could do is make a commitment to a major change in doctrine, operational concepts, weapon systems, or force structure only to find out that it does not address the relevant threats of the future. It is through experimentation that we can distinguish the true leap-aheads in capability, from those that fall short. 
Identifying these failures will be just as important to our achieving success in transformation, as identifying the leap-aheads themselves because it will allow us, in a time of limited budget, to deploy and to utilize our resources in the most effective way. 
We cannot afford to do what we did in the 1980s. The threat was so great, the work that we had to do was so needed, the status of our defense forces and our national security was so at risk, that we had to risk failure to determine success. But we had the budget to accommodate this failure if we had to. We had the budget to experiment and still develop all the potential systems. We don't have that luxury anymore. We don't have the kind of funds that were available in the 1980s. Therefore, we must be selective. And therefore we must have a process which allows us to determine what is the wisest course of action to take. 
Mr. President, previously in our history this country has found itself unprepared for the threats we have faced at the outset of war. With God's grace and with the magnificent commitment and response of the American people, we have always rallied to eventually overcome these threats to our freedom. 
That was always done at a cost, not only the fiscal cost to the taxpayer, but the cost in terms of the lives of young people who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We are currently contemplating the construction of a World War II memorial down on The Mall. It will join the Vietnam memorial. It will join a tribute to the Korean war. It will join other monuments to wars that this country has fought which ought to sober all of us and remind us of the tremendous cost we had to pay in order to secure and maintain our freedom, and to provide freedom for millions of people around the world. 
Previously in this nation's history, we have found ourselves unprepared for the threats we faced at the outset of war. Because we were unprepared, we were vulnerable. Because we were vulnerable, we were exploited. And we had no choice but to respond. We did so, but we did so often at a terrible cost. It was worth the cost because we have maintained our freedom and we enjoy that freedom today. But we desperately want to learn from our history how to avoid those circumstances. And the tragedy that we should have learned is that being unprepared for the threats we face at the outset of conflict results in the need to build significant memorials to those who sacrifice their lives, and to those whose lives were correspondingly changed forever--those families, those relatives, those friends. All this because we failed to prepare for the relevant threats that confront us. 
We desperately want to avoid this situation. We know we will be facing different threats in the future. We know that the way we are currently constituted doesn't necessarily prepare us to address those threats successfully. Obviously, the most successful thing we can do is ensure we are never vulnerable to be exploited in the first place--to be so prepared and to be so strong that no adversary desires to take us on. For us to achieve this preparedness, it is going to take a transformation in thinking. And it is going to take a transformation in structuring our military forces and in our operational concepts for us to be prepared to address the threats of the future. The joint experimentation program is one piece of the puzzle in terms of how we transform our capabilities to do that, and this bill supports that effort. In short, joint experimentation is essential to ensuring that our Armed Forces are prepared to address the security challenges of the 21st century. 
In conclusion--I have taken a long time--the bill makes great strides in improving quality of life, readiness, and modernization of the force. And this bill also lays the framework for the transformation of defense capabilities to address the operational challenges envisioned in the 21st century. 
I want to acknowledge and thank the distinguished service of our chairman, Senator Thurmond, who has provided such diligence and tremendous effort as chairman of this committee. He has been a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for nearly 40 years. This will mark his last defense authorization bill as chairman of the committee. He will always be chairman in our hearts, and chairman emeritus of that committee, and will continue to make significant contributions. What a privilege it has been for this 
Senator to serve under this distinguished leadership of this distinguished member who has given so much to this committee! 
I also thank Senator Glenn for his support and stewardship of defense issues in this, our last defense authorization bill. People have said, `What has happened to our heroes in this country?' John Glenn is a genuine American hero--first to orbit the Earth, and now, at the age of 77, at the termination of a distinguished Senate career, he will climb back in the shuttle and orbit the Earth once again. I think that is one of the most remarkable achievements of this century. And we recognize him for that. 
Senator Levin, as ranking member, has made an outstanding contribution to our efforts. Many others, up and down the committee, have also played very significant roles in this. Again, I say this is a truly bipartisan effort. 
Finally, without the support of our staff, this could not have been accomplished: Les Brownlee, staff director; and his counterpart David Lyles as minority staff director; our committee staff, Steve Madey and John Barnes who have been so helpful to me on the Airland Subcommittee; Charlie Abell, who I think is on the floor here, was so helpful to me during my time as Personnel Subcommittee chairman. 
My personal staff--Frank Finelli, Pam Sellars, Bruce Landis, Sharon Soderstrom, and others--has been so helpful. I couldn't do it without their help. 
And in closing, I wish to state that this defense bill has my full support, and I strongly encourage all members to support it.

Mr. COATS. `The power to tax involves the power to destroy.' 
Mr. President, this famous quote by Chief Justice John Marshall, from the landmark Supreme Court case McCullough versus Maryland, rings as true today as it did in 1819. The Internal Revenue Service, through its unchecked powers of taxation, has been destroying the lives of honest, hard-working, Americans for many years. This systemic abuse has been well documented in the recent oversight hearings on the IRS conducted by the Senate Finance Committee. I rise today to support the IRS Reform and Restructuring Legislation unanimously approved by the Finance Committee. This bill will effectively end this agency's reckless disregard of taxpayer rights. 
We have all heard the horror stories of taxpayer mistreatment inflicted by the IRS. From armed IRS agents raiding innocent taxpayers homes to Americans being subjected to years of harassment and unsubstantiated audits. A few years back one such incident of ineptitude occurred in my own State of Indiana. One of my constituents--who gave me permission to tell his story, but asked that I not disclose his name for fear of retribution from the IRS--was getting ready to buy Christmas dinner for himself and his family. This gentleman was shocked to learn that he had no money in his bank account. His entire savings account had been wiped clean by the IRS for `Back Taxes and Penalties.' Upon calling the IRS, he was told that his tax form from 1987 was missing and he had not answered any of the registered letters sent to him. 
Of course, the IRS sent the registered letters to the address he had lived at in 1987, not his current address--the address from which he correctly filed his taxes (and got returns) for the five subsequent years!!! 
This outrageous tale of mismanagement does not end there. A few months later--after some paper shuffling at the IRS--this gentleman was told that based on the information that he provided the IRS actually owned him a refund of $1500!!!! However, the statute of limitations on refunds had run out and he would not be getting his check. My constituent was not happy with this recent development, but considered the matter over. Of course, ten days later a check for $1500 arrived on his doorstep. Only at the IRS!!!! 
The stories of abuse and mismanagement have come not only from taxpayers, but from IRS employees as well. Past IRS employees describe an agency rife with ineptitude and misconduct. They detail scenarios in which agents were told to target lower-income individuals or those of modest education for audits. One agent testified that `Abuses by the IRS are indicative of a pervasive disregard of law and regulations designed to achieve production goals for either management or the individual agent.' Further, auditors have testified of favoritism being extended to wealthy individuals and powerful corporations. It is obvious that we are dealing with an agency that is out-of-control. 
Throughout history, tax collectors that overtaxed or abused taxpayers were treated with much disdain. In ancient Egypt, a corrupt tax collector who exploited the poor had his nose cut-off. During the French Revolution, tax collectors kept their noses, but lost their heads to the guillotine. But in America, we have a different, innovative method for treating overzealous tax collectors--we reward them with promotions and bonuses!! One particular corrupt agent stole 20 cars and was able to retire with full benefits!! Other agents and divisions were evaluated solely on whether they had achieved certain quotas. The message given from management to the agents was that the ends always justify the means. 
It is disgraceful that an agency of the greatest democracy in the world could have attributes that would be better associated with a paramilitary wing of a despotic regime. It is high time we passed this legislation and urged the new commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Charles Rossotti, to conduct a thorough house-cleaning. 
The IRS exists to serve the American people--not the other way around. There must be more accountability for the IRS and more protection for the taxpayer. Efficiency and honesty should be twin goals for the IRS. H.R. 2676--the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998--is a first step towards achieving this end. 
Mr. President, I will end with another quote from a Supreme Court Justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. This quote has substantial meaning in this debate because it adorns the wall of the IRS building here in Washington. 
`Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.' 
If that is in fact the case, it is time we demand that the Internal Revenue Service act in a civilized manner.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this weekend, students from Lawrence Central High School in Indianapolis will be competing in the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' National Finals here in Washington, D.C. 
After winning the Indiana state competition last December, these students from Lawrence Central (Kari Amos, Robert Baker, Kari Buis, Julie Burton, Sheila Cardinal, Haley Carney, Mark Davis, Justin Gray, Amber Gross, Shawn Haislip, Kristen Halligan, Seth Higgins, Megan Lott, Les Jahnke, Kelly Khoury, Ted Kieffer, Justin Lane, Jolene McClusky, Joyce McCoy, Courtney Mills, Aaron Moberly, Galan Moore, Jon Owens, Chris Recktenwall, Eric Reissner, Kelly Richardson, Lisa Schubert, Tara Sheets, Jennifer Staresnick, Shane White) and their teacher, Drew Horvath, have been eagerly preparing to represent our great Hoosier state here in Washington. 
Mr. President, I am proud of the dedication and the accomplishments of these Hoosier students. As I have stated before, I strongly believe that educational programs, such as the `We the People . . .' competition, are excellent tools for enhancing the education of our children. 
The `We the People . . .' program is the most extensive program to educate our youth about our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I am pleased to welcome these students to our nation's capital. Through the `We the People . . .' program these students have taken the extra step to learn first hand about our government by bringing the pages of their textbooks to life. 
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the students of Lawrence Central High School for their accomplishments and wish them luck in the national competition. I know they will represent our great state of Indiana well.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there has been significant, considerable debate on this issue over the past several days, and then several days before that before the Easter recess. Many of the arguments have been made, discussions have been had, and debate has been engaged in regarding the merits and demerits of NATO expansion. 
I think it is important to put a little bit of historical perspective to this and then I would also like to bring a little bit of perspective as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, because, after all, NATO is a military alliance. It is designed for military purposes primarily. And it is important that we look at the military capacity and capability of the three nations that are being discussed as potential members of NATO. 
So I would like to bring that portion of the discussion to the debate so that Members are aware of some of the facts and considerations relative to that portion of the NATO debate. 
First, the historical perspective. 
This June will mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the Berlin Blockade. Fifty years ago, the United States had passed the Vandenberg Resolution which laid the groundwork for U.S. participation in regional and other cooperative defense alliances. This resolution served to show American support for the commitment European nations had undertaken in the Brussels treaty the previous year to defend against external threats. The resolution marked a formal recognition that the United States had to become constructively engaged in European and world affairs if it were to be successful in influencing and supporting the broader adoption of democratic principles in the world-market economy. 
We had, with tragic consequences, retreated from world affairs earlier in this century, only to pay considerable costs 
in terms of not only monetary costs but, more importantly, in terms of lives because we were drawn into those affairs as a matter of necessity. 
Two successive World Wars demonstrated unequivocally Europe's importance to our own national interests, and the Members of this body, in 1948, were determined that the United States not be forced to catch up to world events again. 
Growing concern at the time about the intentions of the Soviet Union were, of course, pivotal to the debate regarding the formation of the alliance. After World War II, Soviet troops remained in Germany and the other Central/Eastern European countries that the Soviets occupied during the war. 
During the course of the Berlin Blockade, in the midst of that not inconsiderable crisis, the United States engaged Canada and the Brussels treaty powers in discussions that culminated in the establishment of NATO in 1949. Interestingly enough, Mr. President, the reaction then in this body, and in other corridors that were discussing the feasibility of this reaction to both the Vandenberg Resolution and the North Atlantic talks, was decidedly vociferous. 
Eminent scholars and statesmen--George Kennan among them--decried the U.S. decision to pursue this alliance with Britain, Canada, France, and other nations. Kennan, who was the original advocate of containment, described the proposed alliance as provocative and potentially destabilizing. Interestingly enough, that is what much of the debate about the addition of three formerly Soviet Warsaw Pact nations, now Central European nations that have gained independence--much of the debate is centered on that very issue. 
Then, as now, the debate covered a broad spectrum of other issues, including policy, proposed missions, membership, political as well as military aims, and U.S. military aid to Europe. The resultant treaty signed in Washington, DC, on April 4, 1949, committed the parties to: peaceful resolution of disputes; the active promotion of stability and well-being; continuous military vigilance; joint consultation; and devotion to the common defense. 
During the Senate consideration of the treaty, two major issues were discussed: The meaning of the article V commitment, that is, the mutual assistance portion of the treaty; and specific military aid proposed by the administration to assist Europe. 
It is interesting to note that treaty mentions no specific external threat which the alliance was being formed to counter, just as this resolution mentions no specific external threat. 
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State, Dean Acheson affirmed that the treaty was not aimed at any country but was proposed to prevent aggression. `If we want peace,' he said, `we must be prepared to wage peace, with all of our thought, energy, and courage.' At the time, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was careful to assert that the treaty's article V commitment would not remove the constitutional power of Congress to declare war. The Senate subsequently approved the Washington treaty by a vote of 87-8. 
It is interesting to note, that while some say, `All right. That was fine for the time being, but why expand?' there have been three membership extensions to four other nations over subsequent years--in 1952 to Greece and Turkey, in 1955 to Germany, and in 1982 to Spain. 
Today, after nearly 50 years of outstanding success, NATO no longer seems controversial in and of itself. It is widely viewed as the most successful military alliance in history. It was successful in its goal of deterring aggression in Europe. And through a robust commitment to military strength, NATO's existence also brought enhanced stability to Europe, enabling its members to prosper economically. 
Today's debate centers on the addition of three former Eastern bloc nations to NATO and whether somehow this will dilute NATO and its collective commitment to the principles outlined in the treaty. It also talks about whether or not such inclusion and addition of nations will be provocative to Russia and will be destabilizing. 
There are many issues that have and need to be discussed before we vote on NATO and its future. But we must keep in mind that while this debate over what type of missions NATO undertakes in the future is important, it is not, in my opinion, the central consideration of adding new members. 
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were on the forefront of Soviet hegemony during the cold war. For almost 50 years, their people lived under the totalitarianism of a Communist regime. With the fall of the Soviet Union, freedom came at last. They moved forward quickly to transform their economies to the free-market system, to hold democratic elections, and establish the rule of law. There is a compelling reason, moral reason I would submit, to extend NATO membership to these countries. But it is more than that. Because we must remember that NATO is first and foremost a military alliance.  
These nations are able and willing to contribute to the common defense of Europe as they desire the security link of being a part of NATO. That is essential to our consideration-- the answer to that question, Are these nations able, are they willing, to contribute to the common defense of Europe, and do they desire to be part of a 50-year established security link? The 1949 European nations themselves must answer this question. 
Though an expansion of the Soviet Union played a key role in NATO's origins, it was the history of warfare in Europe which spurred the North Atlantic nations to action. Again, as Dean Acheson testified in 1949, `NATO is not to counter any particular threat but rather all aggression. The treaty itself states its purpose as safeguarding freedom, common heritage, and civilization of their people, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law. NATO is designed and said to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area, and a collective defense allowance to preserve peace and security.' 
`The treaty itself,' he said, `invites any other European states in a position to further the principles of this treaty and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to the treaty.' Let me repeat that: `The treaty itself invites any other European states in a position to further the principles of this treaty and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area'--invites them to become part of the alliance. 
These nations, which have been under the suppression and oppression of communism nearly 50 years now, are simply asking us to comply with the terms of the treaty by allowing them, since they are now capable of becoming part of this mutual security alliance and this stabilizing future. It is, in effect, an open-door policy to other nations of Europe who share the goal of defense and are willing to contribute to the security environment. 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, for 50 years under the domination of the Soviet Union, have made the long journey to freedom and the beginnings of prosperity. These nations, always a part of Europe, have been artificially separated from their historic and cultural roots behind an Iron Curtain that had no place in Europe yet divided European nations for nearly 50 years. They now have an opportunity to once again become an integral part of Europe. How can we now deny them the right to belong to a European security alliance? It seems to me a fairly strong imperative that the nations that were previously divided from the rest of Europe now be invited to become a part of an organization dedicated to the survival of Europe. 
Why these three countries? They each have a clear case to demonstrate their commitment to the goals of NATO. In addition, their recent history shows the strength of their new democracies and the openness which generally follows free elections, civilian oversight of the military intelligence, rule of law, market economies--most important, since NATO was never intended to be a free ride. These nations are willing and able to contribute to their own self-defense. Already they have begun the restructuring required to make their militaries compatible with NATO's. 
Continued commitment to this goal will be needed, obviously, over the next decade or more, but for now they are moving substantially in the right direction. The principle of immediate changes--reducing the size of their armies, modernizing their forces, achieving interoperability as it relates to NATO command, control, and communications--is well under way. Poland has already presented a 15-year plan to reduce its forces overhauling the officer corps structure and introducing professional noncommissioned officers. Airfields, ports, and depots are being readied to conduct operations with NATO, and they have conducted many joint operations under the Partnership for Peace program and other programs. 
Poland has established a national military center for language education. It spends, interestingly enough, 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product on defense and intends to maintain this level or increase this level of support. Interestingly enough, Mr. President, that is more than half what the current NATO nations spend as a percentage of GDP. Belgium spends 1.7 percent; Britain, 3.1; Germany, 2.0; the United States, 3.1; as examples of the commitment of nations that spend either less than, equal to, or substantially more than Poland, but clearly they are in the top 50 percent. 
The Czech Republic has begun modernizing its forces. They plan to increase their defense spending by one-tenth of 1 percent of GDP a year for 3 years, bringing spending to $1.2 billion for defense in 2001. 
Hungary is committed to increase defense spending by one-tenth of 1 percent of GDP over 5 years, a substantial amount of money, bringing it from the current 1.4 to 1.8 percent. They have already succeeded in reducing the number of troops from 100,000 to 489,000 and set up a joint peacekeeping battalion in Romania. 
I recently was made aware of testimony given by Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Franklin Kramer before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Some of his testimony has been classified, some of it unclassified. I am going to quote from the unclassified portion of his testimony in which he concludes, `I am fully confident that with the reforms and strategies currently being implemented in all three countries, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will both be reliable allies and net producers of security to the North Atlantic alliance.' Net producers. 
In analyzing their contributions, Mr. Kramer details a whole number of categories in which these commitments have been made. He talks about the interoperability through Partnership for Peace and cites in 1997 alone Poland participated in 22 Partnership for Peace exercises in which the United States also took part. The highlight of these events was `Brave Eagle,' one of the most complex exercises to date, which Poland hosted. Poland also participated in hundreds of bilateral and multilateral exercises, seminars, and other activities with other partners and NATO allies, all of which have contributed to increase their interoperability. The Poles have emphasized military training and tactical exercises in their Partnership for Peace participation. 
I met with members of the Defense Establishment and the Intelligence Establishment recently in my office. Much of what was presented was classified. I can confidently speak to the fact that very significant activity has taken place within these three nations. Poland, in particular, has very significant contributions to make to the NATO alliance on an immediate basis, and Hungary and the Czech Republic also have significant contributions to make. Hungary has participated in 17 multilateral Partnership for Peace exercises just in the last year. The Czechs have participated in 18 of those exercises. 
In addition to that, all three countries have participated in the Partnership for Peace planning and review process in which NATO has established 41 specific interoperability objectives. These include C3/SAR, ground refuelings of aircraft, commonality of airfield procedures, use of NATO communications procedures and terminology, aircraft IFF systems, logistic support, interoperability of communications equipment and of air navigation aids. Poland committed to obtain all 41 of these interoperabilities by 1999, Hungary pledged to reach 38, and the Czech Republic promised to meet 31--a very significant commitment. 
A number of other areas were analyzed, including military reforms and modernization. Each of these nations has ambitious plans in place to bring about reforms in command, control, communications, air defense, traffic control, logistics, infrastructure, personnel reform, reduction in forces, increase in quality of training. I could detail those, but those were provided and I think they are significant. 
Their core capabilities and increase operability plans for personnel, 
for training and NATO doctrine, and for interoperability have all been significant. 
Mr. President, there is good reason to believe that the three countries that we are discussing, in terms of inclusion in NATO, have already made substantial progress and have committed to further substantial progress in the necessary areas of bringing together the fit that will make their inclusion in NATO significant. 
Mr. President, let me examine some of the issues that have been raised in opposition to adding new members to NATO. 
Several academicians and former diplomats have raised the specter of the United States and its NATO allies bogged down in some internal or ethnic dispute involving one or more of the new members. In doing so, they ignore the experience of 50 years in which NATO members, some of whom have experienced their own civil unrest, and some of whom have experienced conflicts with their own NATO partners, have ignored the fact these relations have improved their respective democratic institutions, and that they have grown steadily more stable and more productive. NATO, rather than fostering instability, has provided a forum for the resolution of conflicts among its members. Turkey and Greece are probably the prime example. The prospect of NATO membership has hastened the resolution of disputes between Hungary and Romania and the Czech Republic and Germany. There are numerous examples of reconciliations and resolutions of conflict that have taken place just in the anticipation of becoming part of NATO. 
A second objection has been directed toward the NATO directive to collectively and individually develop and maintain the capacity to resist an armed attack; that is, that the costs connected with admitting new members are uncertain and could be substantially more than NATO's estimate of $1.5 billion over 10 years as the U.S. share. Detractors using this argument tend to follow it in virtually the same breath with the statement that the principal threat has gone away. On the one hand, they say the threat has gone away, and they are saying, therefore, we don't need to be concerned about future security arrangements; and on the other hand, they say they are concerned about the potential of future conflict, and, therefore, that will drive the costs up. 
Well, let's accept the premise for a moment that there is no specific threat. The NATO common costs of accepting these new members is dependent upon that threat--if the threat is substantial, then the costs will likely be substantial as well. In contrast, a reduced threat will almost certainly mean a minimal expenditure. Current plans call for the latter. Prospective members are expected to obtain compatible command and control systems, maintain air defense and ground forces appropriate to their nation's security needs, and maintain one squadron of modern tactical aircraft. In addition, they are to provide sufficient facilities infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of NATO forces into their respective nations in the event of a crisis. Obviously, if a substantive threat should arise, then the number and mix of required forces could increase, and maybe substantially. But just as clear is that we would want to meet those increased requirements to counter the increased threat, and we would want to be ahead of the game by having built the communications and air defense infrastructures during a time of relative peace and stability. 
Having said that, the anticipation is that the threat will 
be decreased, that more stability will result and, therefore, lower costs. 
I am also troubled by those who raise the specter of the article V commitment. We have all heard this said in many different ways, most unfortunately as, `Who wants to die for Poland?' `Who wants to die for Hungary or the Czech Republic?' This is particularly offensive when you consider Hitler's and Stalin's largely unopposed subjugation of Central Europe--including Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary--particularly Czechoslovakia--in the early days of World War II. The fact is that I have no doubt of the resolve of America and her NATO allies to take appropriate steps if any NATO member is under attack; nor do I doubt the serious and earnest intent of the three nations seeking to join us in NATO to do the same. 
As for the supposed difficulty in obtaining consensus, it is hard to see that this could be the case. How can U.S. leadership be sufficient to acquire consensus on vital issues when the members total 16 but not sufficient when the members total 19? From my perspective, the difficulty will vary according to the circumstance, not the absolute number of members. I think an agreement that gives one nation--who is not a member of NATO--the opportunity to bully and threaten NATO members in NATO headquarters ought to be of far greater concern. 
Finally, there is the consideration of others' attitudes about NATO expansion and the potential influence upon other matters of importance to the United States. As many of my colleagues are aware, many well-regarded scholars and celebrities have raised concerns over Russia's reaction to expansion. They insist that Russia's good will is imperative and should come before other considerations, particularly the expansion of NATO membership. An oft-cited example is the Russian Duma's failure to ratify START II, allegedly because of NATO expansion. Frankly, the Duma has been dragging its feet on START II for 3 years, not because of the NATO expansion question, but primarily due to the cost of implementing the treaty rather than NATO itself. The same argument, used in relation to the Chemical Weapons Convention, was put to rest when the Duma moved forward and ratified it, after individuals said, `If we ratify this treaty, the Russians will walk away.' That does not seem to support a clear connection between the decision on NATO expansion and START II ratification. 
Let's be frank, Mr. President, Russia is going to pursue activities that benefit her national interest as she perceives them, just as the United States pursues those interests that benefit our national interest as we perceive them, and this treaty is not going to change that fact. 
Fifty years ago a similar debate was taking place as it relates to Russia and the creation of NATO. Stalin blockaded Berlin both to express displeasure at an attempt to roll back the Marshall Plan and related initiatives, as well as to convince the United States that its role in Europe was ill-advised. The United States and its allies held to their position and signed the Washington treaty in April of 1949. One month later, the Soviet Union lifted the blockade. We must do what we think is right, independent of what the debate is in the Russian Duma. That is not to say that we are uninterested in Russia and what Russian leaders think and its citizens think. Quite the contrary. It is essential that we remain engaged with Russia--politically, economically, and in relation to security 
concerns. We must work to achieve our mutual interests but continue to support the transformation of this nation to a strong and healthy democratic system. Our relationship with Russia, however, does not mean ignoring the desires of Central and Eastern European nations simply because we find some Russian resistance. NATO is a defensive alliance, not an offensive alliance. We must state that. That is its history. Russia knows that. We know that. NATO knows that. This has been reaffirmed--this fundamental aspect of the treaty. Russia has nothing to fear from NATO as it currently exists, nor from NATO with its new members. We must continue to reassure them, to work with them and bring them fully into the West's orbit. It is important that both the United States and Russia realize that both can benefit from this new relationship. 
NATO remains in America's strategic interests as long as Europe remains in our interest. Likewise, the addition of new members to this treaty is also in our interest. When we expand membership to like-minded nations, we extend the security of Europe and the stabilizing influence of the alliance itself. We may not have any one single threat at this time, but the world remains an insecure and unstable place. The continuity of an expanded NATO will assure that this successful military alliance will continue to play a stabilizing role in Europe and help ensure our preparedness to take on future threats. 
I believe that the American people are deserving of a temperate and deliberate debate on the merits of the accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. This has been a worthwhile discussion, a necessary debate, one of the critical functions of the U.S. Senate. 
As many of you now know, I have supported these countries' accession to NATO, not out of an interest of righting wrongs but in recognition of their geopolitical importance and their progress as democratic states determined to join with other NATO members in preserving the peace that NATO has won in Europe. This debate, this vote, will affirm the importance of these nations to NATO's continued mission. 
Mr. President, I look forward to a successful vote and to a formal accession in Washington next spring.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the Craig amendment numbered 2316 to the NATO enlargement treaty. 
Under the previous order, at noon Senator Moynihan will be recognized to offer an amendment under a 1-hour time agreement. 
Following the debate on the Moynihan amendment, Senator Warner will be recognized to offer an amendment under a 2-hour time agreement. 
Following the debate on the Warner amendment, at approximately 3 p.m., at the conclusion of that debate, the Senate will proceed to three stacked rollcall votes. 
The first vote will be on or in relation to the Moynihan amendment, followed by a vote on or in relation to the Warner amendment, followed then by a vote on or in relation to the Craig amendment. 
As a reminder, a unanimous consent agreement was reached which limits the amendments to the NATO treaty. It is hoped that any Senator still intending to offer an amendment under the consent agreement will do so early tomorrow to allow the Senate to complete action on this important document by early tomorrow evening. 
Also, if available, the Senate may consider the conference report to accompany the supplemental appropriations bill. 
Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the Thursday session of the Senate. 
Mr. President, that is an ambitious schedule. Senators are urged to be timely. Senators are urged, those who may have additional amendments to the NATO enlargement treaty, to make those amendments known to leadership, and hopefully reasonable time requests can be entered into. A number of Senators are making very important official business commitments for the weakend, and the more definite the plans can be about the schedule tomorrow, the more expeditiously those commitments can be undertaken.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am here today to announce, along with several Members--in fact, a coalition of 30 Republican Members from both the House and the Senate called the Renewal Alliance, which has been in business now for a considerable amount of time--more than a year--will be jointly introducing new initiatives to help restore hard-pressed urban neighborhoods of our country to reach out to families and communities and neighbors that are dealing with some of the most difficult and intractable social problems that affect our society. 
This package, called REAL Life--renewal, empowerment, achievement, and learning for life--contains what we believe are essential elements to help bring improvements and restore hope to impoverished communities and to bring self-sufficiency to low-income individuals and families. REAL Life seeks to address the critical deficits facing neighborhoods and communities, families, those communities and neighborhoods who lie behind the gleaming skyscrapers, the neighborhoods where some of the most difficult problems in our society--homelessness, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, poverty, and violence--are found in some of the most complex and intractable forms in the neighborhoods, however, where groups of individuals and private community organizations and leaders are already at work defeating the poverty and dysfunction that have defied our well-intentioned and lavishly funded Federal efforts. 
Before I begin to make specific comments about the legislation that we will be introducing, let me take a moment to read from a letter given to me by Light of Life Ministries, a rescue mission operating in Pittsburgh, PA. I think this letter communicates in a very compelling and clear way both the problems that we face today in our low-income areas and particularly in our cities--although these are no respecters of income or persons, but it seems that the problems are particularly acute in some of our urban areas--but also addresses some of the solutions that even today are within our grasp. 
This letter is from a fellow named Benjamin Primis, a young man who, after a promising start in life, fell on hard times. He was a graphic artist working in the television industry, and he began using drugs and became addicted to crack cocaine. Soon he was homeless and desperate. 
Benjamin writes: 
I found myself homeless in Pittsburgh. It seemed as though the world had turned its back on me. . . . When there was nowhere else to run, the Light of Life Ministry in Pittsburgh opened their doors of unconditional love. . . . Instantly I was comforted with three hot meals a day, clean linens, drug and alcohol therapy. . . . They fed me when I was hungry. They clothed me when I had nothing else to wear. [Most importantly,] they cared for me when I didn't care for myself. 
Benjamin Primis's story is one of thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of stories of hope and restoration and healing that bring us together here on this floor, the Senate floor, this morning. Ben Primis was failed by both the dogmas and initiatives of Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. A booming economy did not prevent his fall into poverty. And the Government safety net proved to be an illusion. Instead, Ben was rescued by one of the thousands of neighborhood-based, privately run, often faith-based religious charities that operate in poor neighborhoods across our country. 
Let me give another example, Mr. President. For years, officials in the District of Columbia and Members of Congress have wrestled with the problem of violence in this city that has plagued this city. A lot of programs have been tried, and the police department has been strengthened and reorganized and redeployed on several occasions to almost no effect. It seemed that none of the often very expensive initiatives had any fruition. 
Last year, a group of African American men called the Alliance of Concerned Men began brokering peace treaties among the gangs that inhabit, and frequently dominate, some of the city's public housing complexes. Benning Terrace in southeast Washington, known to the D.C. police department as perhaps the most dangerous area of the city, has not had a single murder since the Alliance's peace treaty went into effect early last year. This movement is now spreading across the city. 
These are community healers who are saving lives where all other Government efforts have failed. I have met with these individuals. I have listened to their stories and some of the most remarkable stories of transformation of individual lives 
and reconciliation that anyone could ever encounter. 
The Light of Life Mission in Pittsburgh, the Alliance of Concerned Men in Washington, DC, Gospel Rescue Mission of Washington, these are the kinds of organizations that the Renewal Alliance REAL Life initiative wants to place at the center of our Nation's welfare and social policies.

Mr. COATS. That is propitious then. The Senator will take all 2 of those minutes. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, in summary, let me state that what we are attempting to accomplish here is a third alternative. We believe that the well-intentioned, well-motivated programs of the past, at great cost to the taxpayers, have failed to successfully address some of the most difficult social problems facing our Nation, and particularly problems facing low-income urban communities where in many situations nothing but crime and drugs are the prevalent activities of those organizations. By the same token, the argument that no Federal policy is the best policy to address these problems is something that we as a group cannot accept. 
We think this third alternative, providing REAL Life meaningful solutions to the areas of community renewal, economic empowerment and educational opportunities for low-income families offers real hope. It does so not through Government organizations, Government structures or even significant Government funding. It does so by encouraging those community volunteer, nonprofit, often faith-based organizations that already exist and should exist in greater numbers to take a much greater role in addressing these problems. We want to make the Federal Government not the dominant partner but a junior partner, an entity that can assist through the provision of Tax Code changes, primarily tax credits and other incentives, to encourage individuals and other organizations to contribute to these nonprofit groups to allow them to do a better job. They have demonstrated success at an efficiency rate and at a cost-effectiveness that far exceeds those current programs in place. 
Are we calling for a dismantling of the safety net? No, we are not. We are calling for a better use of dollars, a better commitment, stronger commitment to organizations which have demonstrated real success in providing hope to individuals, transformation and renewal of communities. 
Mr. President, I believe the time is probably expired, and with that I yield the floor and encourage my colleagues to take a look at the REAL Life Renewal Alliance initiative which we are happy to provide and discuss with our colleagues.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this amendment Members will be voting on shortly simply adds an incentive to the current deduction that is allowed for individuals making contributions to tax-exempt organizations that provide scholarships for low-income children. 
Currently it is 100 percent deductible. We are adding an additional 10 percent incentive so that these organizations, of which currently more than 30 exist around the country, can receive additional funds through this incentive so that they can offer additional scholarships to children trapped in an educational system which allows them no escape. There are currently programs operating in virtually every major city in the country. They are giving children a chance. 
Those who say, `If you can't give everybody a chance, you can't give anybody a chance', are like those standing on the Titanic saying, `If we don't have enough lifeboats for all on this sinking ship, nobody gets to use the existing lifeboats.' 
These kids are condemned to failure with no way out of the plight they are in. Let us allow these organizations that are reaching out through private contributions a chance to give these kids a chance. 
This is paid for. It is revenue neutral. Earlier the offset was an elimination of the gambling loss deduction. That has been replaced. There was controversy. We wanted the focus to be on this amendment. That has been replaced by two provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, changes that are approved by the Finance Committee. There should be no controversy on that. 
I urge my colleagues to give children, low-income children in minority situations mostly in urban schools--let us give them a chance.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment the author of the underlying legislation. It has been an extraordinary effort. It is a bipartisan effort, we ought to stress, and it is one that clearly offers long-term improvement in education and opportunities in education for many Americans. I thank them for their work on this, and I intend to support them when it comes to a vote. 
There has been a critique of the legislation in that most of the benefits will flow to middle-income Americans and above, 
and that we are not paying adequate attention to low-income Americans and particularly those who attend urban schools, so many of which are failing urban schools. 
That critique is really misplaced because that is not the intent of the bill. There have been other opportunities offered on this floor, again, in a bipartisan fashion. Senator Lieberman and I have joined forces on a number of occasions to try to address specifically the problems of low-income students, minority students, who are receiving inadequate educations, and each time those efforts have been met with a filibuster and defeated. 
There have been other initiatives. I have offered some, and other Members have offered some. We are going to continue to do that. So the critique is really misplaced. But in an effort to strengthen the underlying bill which we are addressing, I am offering this amendment which I will explain in a moment. 
It is clear that there will be Americans, a sizable number of Americans, who don't have the income to take advantage of the tax-free savings accounts that are created in this legislation. Under the best of circumstances, it would take them years to accumulate the amount of money necessary to utilize those funds for alternative means of education. We cannot afford years. We are losing people to the system, and it is an inadequate system. 
Let me take a moment to talk about that crisis that exists in urban education. 
A recent study published by Education Week points out just how desperate the situation has become. In 1997, just 43 percent of grade-school-age children attending urban schools met the basic standard for reading skills, and that `basic,' just for my colleagues' understanding, is defined as being able to read a very simple child's book or children's literature. Among children attending urban schools in high-poverty areas, basic reading ability rates fall to just 23 percent of students. Think of it: Fewer than one in three children attending schools in poor neighborhoods can read a simple story; two-thirds of nonurban students meet the basic standard for mathematics. 
Among urban students in high-poverty areas, this one-in-three statistic is truly disturbing. Looking at the area of science, while 65 percent of nonurban students are meeting the basic standard in science achievement, only 38 percent of urban students perform this, and in high-poverty schools, only 31 percent. So, again, fewer than one in three are meeting these standards. 
A public school system in which over two-thirds of our children are functionally illiterate in reading, in science, in math is a system that cannot and must not be defended. Yet, those who are opposing any efforts to try to move this system to improve it or reform it, to provide alternatives for children trapped in the system, are met with disdain, are met with challenges. 
The logic--actually, I should say the illogic--of the opponents of attempts at reform is difficult to understand, because it is literally condemning poor children to an inadequate education. The one chance they have to escape the plight that they live in is being denied them, because people want to maintain--some people want to maintain--the status quo, and the status quo is bankrupt. 
Every year, we debate, as I said, different proposals to permit these low-income children to escape the plight in which 
they find themselves. Every year, we talk about the need for competition to force public schools to reform the way in which they teach their children. And every year, we are met on the Senate floor with a filibuster by those who say, `No; let's maintain the status quo in the name of absolute equality.' 
One of the analogies that is often used is that we are just simply trying to throw lifeboats out and scholarships are just lifeboats that are not available to all; and if they are not available to all, then they shouldn't be available to anybody. 
A lot of us have seen the recent epic `The Titanic.' Fortunately, the opponents of the basis of the proposal that, if you can't help everybody, you shouldn't help anybody were not running the Titanic, because then everybody would have been denied an opportunity to escape on a lifeboat because there were not enough lifeboats for everybody. 
If we cannot help everybody all at once, we are not going to help anybody. That is the logic of the opponents of any attempt, whether it is this bill, whether it is the voucher bill that this Senator, Senator Lieberman, and others have been offering, or whether it is any other proposal that other Members have been offering. That is the logic of the opposition. It does not match up. 
Recently--I think it was just yesterday or maybe a couple days ago--the President at a press conference with the Democratic leadership challenged the supporters of scholarships to make their case to the Nation, he said. The President said, `You ought to do something rather than just talk about it.' 
Mr. President, I don't know where you have been lately--well, maybe I do know, preoccupied with other matters--but if you will just look very closely, you will understand that things are being done by those who favor the proposal. We are doing something. 
Currently, there are 32 privately funded scholarship programs operating across this country. In virtually every major urban area of this Nation--New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Seattle, Indianapolis, Albany, San Antonio, Atlanta, just to name a few--private citizens are joining forces to provide poor children a way out of collapsing public school systems. To date, these foundations have raised over $30 million and have provided assistance to over 13,000 children. Just this morning, we learned that a major private funder of private school choice announced a $50 million gift to San Antonio's program that will permit any low-income student in the San Antonio system to opt out of a public school if they are not getting an adequate education. 
I say we are putting our money where our mouths are. Individuals are stepping forward, people are addressing it and are doing so out of a matter of desperation, desperation that children are being left behind and are not buying into this idea that if you cannot do it for everybody right now, don't do it for anybody. 
The demand for this is rising. We are all familiar with the New York City Private Scholarship Foundation. When they announced they had 13 new scholarships for low-income children, they received 17,000 applications. Ten percent of the eligible population of New York said, `Give us a chance. Give us something different.' 
They were overwhelmed by the response. 
Last year, the Washington Scholarship Fund here in the District of Columbia announced plans to offer 1,000 new scholarships and received 7,500 requests. That represents 15 percent of the eligible population in the D.C. public schools. 
A recent poll of minority parents published last year found that two-thirds of them are crying out for some alternative for education. Low-income families in cities around the country are saying, `We refuse to continue to allow our children to be condemned to schools which don't give them any chance to escape the poverty that they live in.' 
My colleague, Senator Lieberman, has appealed to his party to say: We are the party of equality. We are the party that reaches out to help those who need help, and yet we are turning our backs on the very people our party is supposed to defend. We are condemning them to an inadequate education and therefore condemning them to a life in which they will not be able to participate in the American dream. 
The only way out of many of these areas in our urban cities is drugs, athletics, or education. One in 10,000 make it into college athletics. That is the statistics of all the kids playing basketball, baseball, and football: 1 in 10,000 gets a college scholarship. Out of that, the number is infinitesimal of those who can go on and actually earn a living playing professional sports. So while many dream of being the next Michael Jordan, the reality is that only 1 in about 100,000 or maybe a million is going to be that person or have that opportunity. 
The next alternative is drugs and crime. And the statistics there are appalling. Children are dying on the streets, as we speak, at tender ages because they think the way out of their plight--the only way out of their plight--is to move drugs. And that is a prescription for death, that is a prescription for incarceration, that is a prescription for failure. 
What do parents want? They understand those realities. They want their children to be educated, given the skills necessary to be able to enter today's workplace, given the education to be able to go on and further their education after high school. And they are not getting that in our urban schools. 
How does my amendment try to address this? We try to provide a little piece of a solution to the puzzle we are trying to put together, a mosaic we are trying to put together to try to get us out of this conundrum that tweaks the Tax Code a little bit to give a little extra encouragement to people who donate money to those scholarship funds. 
Under current law, a contribution to a 501(c)(3) organization that provides scholarships is deductible against income. My amendment would simply give them a 10 percent incentive to try to encourage more people to give more. We offset that so that it is paid for and revenue neutral. I offered an offset which I thought would be fairly attractive, but I could not get the votes to support it. I did not want to see my amendment fail on that basis, so we worked with the majority leader, we worked with Members, to try to find something that had been vented by the Finance Committee, had been approved as a potential offset. And I do not believe there is any controversy. We have tried to run all the traps on that in terms of the offset. 
I can describe the offset. It is two technical items that pay for the change which takes place in the Tax Code with this. What it means is that if a family wanted to donate $500 to a scholarship fund or an individual, they would get a $550 deduction for that. It is an extra incentive. It is just a small piece. I mean, people are going to come down and probably say, `Well, this doesn't solve the problem.' No, it does not solve the problem, but it is a step in the right correction. It is a tiny step. And I guess we are reaching out saying, at least can we take some tiny steps to help people who find themselves in an absolute lockbox of inadequate education with no way to escape? 
This is my latest attempt. I keep trying to bring ideas down here to try to give poor kids, minority kids, kids condemned to failing urban schools, a chance to get out and get an education. I try to use it as a basis to spur some competition so those who run the public schools will get the idea they need to improve their schools. 
We really care about these low-income children, which this bill does not address, but, again, that is not the intent of the bill. I think this strengthens the bill. Then we ought to look for ways in which we can encourage alternatives to education and encourage competition in the system that will force some change. 
I will never forget the testimony of the former 25-year superintendent of the Milwaukee public schools, an educated man, an African American, who said: Senator, I've tried everything. You can't name a reform proposal within the system that has worked. The unions block it. The public teachers don't want it. We've tried everything. I defy you to name an approach within the current public education system that forces change. Only one thing has forced change in the Milwaukee public schools, and that is the competition from private schools, the vouchers and the scholarships that have been available so that parents can vote with their feet and their children may have a choice. All of a sudden that has wakened up the Milwaukee public schools which has said, `We've got to change or we're going to lose these kids.' 
So instead of trying to perpetuate a bureaucracy that protects their employment, and their tenure, they have said, `Let's make the changes that will give students an opportunity to learn, to read, to meet the math and the science skills, to advance in their education.' 
Who do we care more about? Protecting the system or helping the children? That is the only thing. And so this is an attempt to, one, provide some lifeboats for some kids who are trapped--no, we cannot provide enough for everybody. That really isn't even my intent. My intent is to reform the public school system, because we are going to have, and we need to have, a public school system, a viable public school system, but we can do it by providing competition. In the meantime, we can at least help some kids. This amendment will do that. I hope I have the support of my colleagues in doing so. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, earlier in debate on this, I attempted to offer a compromise amendment partly because I believed, and still do, that the assessment of achieving reading and math standards is important information for parents, school boards, and others involved in education to make appropriate decisions about how changes should be accomplished so that we can achieve better results. 
There was a lot of complication with that because of the concern about the influence of the Department of Education over the design of the tests, the fact that some of this information assessment might not be accurately assessed. 
What I was attempting to accomplish was to give parents more knowledge so they could put more pressure on their local public schools to do a better job, to accept reforms. In many instances I was concerned because State departments of education are deceiving parents in an effort, from a political standpoint, to convince their constituents that their schools are doing just fine, that their students are doing as well as anyone. They are not administering tests, I think, or interpreting those tests in the way that gives parents adequate reflection of that. 
If we could structure this in a way to get an independent, outside the Department of Education test, voluntary on a State basis, it could be helpful. 
Well, we weren't able to do that. I think it is now entirely appropriate that the Senator's amendment, which essentially says set this aside until we authorize it, debate this thing, work it through, is the way to go. So I am going to support his amendment. I thank the Senator for the time.

Mr. COATS. No. The Senator is correct. There seems, however, to be some considerable degree of confusion in the Congress about how that test is going to be structured and what the process is and an expression on the part of many Members that Congress ought to be involved in the process. So let's just temporarily put that on hold so that the Congress can engage in terms of a better understanding and defining how that ought to be put together. I have agreed that perhaps that is the best way to go, because unless we really have some better understanding and assessment of that, I am not exactly sure we are going to accomplish what we want. I think the basic principle that I tried to propose earlier, which the Senator supports, I still retain that. I am going to work toward that end.

Mr. COATS. I will be happy to do that. Mr. President, I will use up the last 2 minutes. 
Very briefly, I do not think this amendment is all that controversial. It simply provides an extra incentive for individuals or organizations that want to make charitable contributions to scholarship funds which would provide scholarships for low-income children for educational purposes. As such, we are just simply offering an additional deduction of 10 percent for that specific purpose. I outlined earlier the basis for that and the reasons why we need to do that. I believe it complements the bill we are dealing with. The current bill addresses essentially middle income and above taxpayers. This goes to low-income taxpayers, and it gives them an opportunity to provide the kind of education they think is appropriate for their children. 
I hope my colleagues will accept it. The cost is offset by changes in the Tax Code which have been approved by the Finance Committee. There is no controversy there. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment when the vote occurs tomorrow morning.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that is currently before us. Although Senator Kennedy may be using the opportunity to talk about the broader bill, it is the amendment that we will have to vote on unless that amendment is withdrawn. I want to briefly state reasons why I think Members should vote against that particular amendment. 
A primary reason is that it is unnecessary. The Labor Committee on which both the Senator from Massachusetts and I serve has, as part of the Higher Education Act, just unanimously voted out of the committee a loan forgiveness program for teachers, which I believe is far more effective than what is being offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. 
That teacher loan forgiveness program provides loan forgiveness to teachers who have loans that are eligible for the interest subsidy, ensuring that those who qualify would be most in need of help of repaying the loans. 
The second condition is that the teacher be employed for 3 years; third, that they teach in a public or private school whose school district has 30 percent or more of its students eligible for title I assistance; that they have an academic major in the subject area in which they teach if they are a high school teacher, and have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, and mathematics if they are elementary schoolteachers. 
The reason these conditions were imposed and, by the way, again, unanimously accepted by the Labor Committee, is because we wanted to target loan forgiveness to the most qualified teachers. We did not want a broad, all-encompassing loan forgiveness program, which I believe the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts covers about 90 percent of the teachers in this country--all those employed within the title I schools, which equals about 90 percent. The issue is not just more teachers; the issue is better qualified teachers. 
Statistics show, and studies show, that the real shortage is not the number of teachers--I could go into some detail on that, but I do not have time to do it--but the issue and the need is for qualified teachers. So we have structured this loan forgiveness program to support and emphasize teachers who meet these particular qualifications. 
The second reason I believe Members should not support this particular amendment is that the average debt for teachers is considerably more than what the Senator's amendment offers in terms of forgiveness. Ours allows provisions for up to $10,000 of loan forgiveness, which more closely meets the debt problems that teachers currently face, rather than the $8,000 which the Senator's amendment provides. 
Finally, the amendment is directed toward schools in general, the loan forgiveness program, whereas the Labor Committee amendment is basically directed toward the poorest schools, teachers that meet the qualifications as outlined in the Labor Committee's language, which is designed specifically for the purpose of trying to address the most critical need in this country, and that is getting qualified teachers who have the credentials to teach and are teaching in the Nation's poorest schools. I outlined those criteria earlier. 
But that was the basis for the Labor Committee's drafting of the language to address the most critical need, and that is where we ought to be putting our resources. It is not the schools in some of the more affluent suburbs that are having problems attracting teachers, particularly qualified teachers; it is the schools in the poorest districts, the schools in the low-income districts, the schools in the minority districts, that are having trouble attracting qualified teachers to teach their students. Those are the teachers that we want to encourage through this loan forgiveness program. 
So for those reasons, I urge our colleagues to oppose the amendment being offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, primarily because it is not needed, it has been addressed, it has been supported unanimously by the Labor Committee. It is directed toward the areas that need it the most; it is directed towards supporting qualified teachers. For those reasons, I urge a no vote on the amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Labor Committee, of which the Senator from Massachusetts is the ranking member--the Senator joined his colleagues on the Democrat side and joined all Republicans in passing out of the Labor Committee language unanimously. He did not offer his amendment there, so I just wonder what has changed. Obviously, what has changed is that the amendment is designed to gut the underlying Coverdell bill. 
Secondly, the language of the Senator's amendment is not targeted. It says title I eligibility. Title I covers 96 percent of all schools. That is not targeted. Targeted is designed to address a specific problem. A specific problem is the minority students, poor students, students in poor districts who are not getting the qualified teachers and the education they need. 
This Labor Committee product targets it towards those teachers. The Senator's language does not target; it says, where there is a shortage of qualified elementary and secondary school teachers under the title I programs. That is 96 percent. I do not call that being targeted. 
So for those reasons, I believe we should oppose the amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I note that the `Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998' contains a provision which amends the `Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.' This provision deals with how the provision on elimination of geographic barriers to adoption is enforced. It is my understanding that this amendment does not affect the other provisions in the new law on reasonable efforts or the termination of parental rights. 
It is my understanding that the purpose of the new law was to clarify federal policy regarding the protection of children in foster care. The adoption law makes clear that the health and safety of children must always be of paramount concern in any decision affecting the removal of children from their homes or the reunification of children with their families. 
To receive foster care and adoption assistance funds, States are generally required to make reasonable efforts to maintain children in their own homes or to reunify children and families when possible. However, it is my understanding that under the new law, the federal government does not require States to make such efforts in cases where a court finds that a parent has killed or assaulted a child or subjected the child to extreme forms of abuse or neglect. At the same time, the new law does not prevent a State from making efforts to preserve or reunify a family in such cases, as long as the child's health and safety are the paramount considerations. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments, no more than 5 minutes, if that is acceptable, to speak about the pending amendment. 
Mr. President, just a couple of weeks ago I was privileged to chair a congressional symposium on the question of child care and parenting held by the Subcommittee on Children and Families. The purpose was to examine many of the issues surrounding the whole question of child care and the needs of America's working families. 
We tried to do what very few policymakers do these days. Instead of starting with an assumption that a certain program and place ought to just be expanded, we went back to the basics, back to fundamentals. We asked the questions: What do the experts think is best for children? What do families think is best for them? What do they think they need? Politics aside, special interests aside and, in the best of all worlds, if we were starting over, where would we start? 
What we learned from that symposium, convening experts from all across the political spectrum, different philosophies represented, but experts in the field, including mothers who have spent a great deal of time raising their families and studying these issues is that families want more time with their children, not less time. They want Government to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned dollars so that they have more choices in terms of how they spend those dollars, rather than deciding here that we are just simply going to spend more money on new programs or new bureaucracies. 
We learned that they want to rely less on child care, to have more flexible work hours, comptime and other profamily benefits that many Federal employees currently enjoy. We learned what children have is what Dr. Stanley Greenspan calls `irreducible needs.' He indicated the studies have shown there is a significant concern that our society `has begun to advocate out-of-home care as the desired option rather than as a backup system for those who need it.' 
According to experts like Jay Belsky of Penn State University, prolonged exposure to out-of-home care can have very serious results on long-term child development, because it impacts adversely on the way a child relates and bonds with his mother. It appears to have a negative impact on maternal sensitivity to the child, which is critical, as these experts have said, to child development. 
These are facts, Dr. Belsky said, that are overwhelming and should not be dismissed. He said they--this early interaction and bonding between mother and child--are as profound as the effects of child care on cognitive and social development. 
We have invested very heavily in the question of child care, but we ought to be wary of proposals which fail to address the needs and desires of a majority of American children and American families. So instead of choosing to promote a continuation of the current system, we ought to look at what these experts are telling us and at least try to find a way to balance what we do to provide incentives for parents who often, at considerable financial sacrifice, choose to stay home with their children, particularly in the early months and early 
years. 
We need to talk about positive family-friendly policies, extended job leaves, part-time work, flextime, comptime, job sharing, telecommunicating and other corporate policies which allow families to have more time with children, not less time with children. 
We ought to encourage ways in which we can increase parental involvement through tax fairness. Anybody who studies the Tax Code knows it is the families raising children that are most discriminated against in our Tax Code. We have often allowed more tax credits, as a former Representative used to say, for breeding racehorses than for raising children, because we penalize families that choose to stay home with their children by narrowly linking tax benefits to day care expenses. The dependent-care tax credit says that the more time you spend away from your children, the more time in out-of-home care, the greater the expense, the greater the credit. 
The Sessions amendment, which I am here to advocate support for and vote for, is a good first step, hopefully the beginning of an extensive congressional recognition of the importance of at-home care. 
We do need a strong, quality child care program for parents who work out of the home. We need to make sure that it is available to parents, but we also need to make sure that what is available to parents is maximum choices in terms of how they determine the best way to raise their children. They need to be treated equally, and the experts tell us that they need to be treated equally because ultimately this is the best for children. We recognize that not every working family can afford a stay-at-home parent, but we also recognize and need to understand that what the experts are telling us is that this is the preferred option, this is the option for which we ought to be providing incentives. 
This sense-of-the-Senate amendment before us today is a way that we as a body can recognize that fact and we can endorse, so that in our debates about how we expand the Tax Code, in our debates about how we address work policies, in our process of determining what is best for children, we will focus on what is best for children and look at the balance that is necessary to address those families that want a parent to stay at home and take care of their children, primarily because that is what is best for children. If we are talking about cognitive development, if we are talking about social development, we are talking about uniting parents and children at the earliest stages of their lives. 
There is no child care provider who can provide what a motivated mother and informed mother can provide for their child. There is no child care provider who can provide the love and nurturing necessary for the development of that child, and we need to have incentives built into our law that don't discriminate against but actually encourage and enhance that selection. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment of Senator Sessions that we will shortly be voting on and trust that it will receive an overwhelming bipartisan encouragement and affirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are considering an amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, which is designed to address one part of the increasingly contentious debate over affirmative action. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Adarand decision most probably makes the existing Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program unconstitutional; and, therefore, I think the Senator's amendment is appropriate. 
There is a growing sense, however, that as well-intentioned as affirmative action and set-aside programs are, whether they are constitutional or not, really in any way can be reconciled to the American commitment to equal justice under law. At the same time, I think it is important to point out that Americans do remain deeply troubled by the persistent poverty and lack of opportunity that quotas and affirmative action were originally meant to remedy. As unemployment approaches zero in much of the country, the inner cities are still overwhelmed by double-digit joblessness, social breakdown, and education failure. 
I want to be clear here this evening: Quotas and set-asides are not the answer to these problems. We have tried that. It has not worked. It does, I believe, violate constitutional principles of equal justice under law. Set-asides and quota programs have been largely a non sequitur to the social and economic questions faced by the urban poor. 
Quotas and set-asides do not strengthen civil society and do not strengthen our neighborhoods. It is the churches and charities and volunteer groups and community associations that bind neighborhoods together, along with strong families. That is what makes progress possible in these areas, not a statute written by the Congress that attempts to force a solution that cannot be forced. 
Quotas and set-asides do not foster the kind of spirit of entrepreneurship, that is necessary and needed in these communities, by encouraging the creation of the kinds of small businesses that provide employment and help anchor community life. And they do nothing at all for millions of children who are trapped primarily in urban public schools serving primarily low-income families--schools which, by any measure, are failing to provide adequate education for children who are trapped in this school system. 
When it comes to the real concerns of urban America, the national debate over set-asides and quotas is just off the mark, Not just off the mark; it is irrelevant. An unfortunate side effect of this debate, however, is that it gives the impression that those who support the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky have nothing else to say about the real concerns of poor Americans living in inner cities, 
all they want to do is eliminate the one advantage that individuals have. 
Now, in the warp and woof of this quota debate, these supporters--Republicans, conservatives, and the others--are painted as largely unknowing and uncaring and uninterested in the real concerns of the poor. Now, if this charge was warranted, it would be a tragedy--a tragedy for our party, a tragedy for conservatives, a tragedy for Republicans. But such a charge is not warranted. 
Those who would support the amendment from the Senator from Kentucky, those who would acknowledge that the quota set-aside program has not addressed the real problems, are not those without alternative proposals. They are not those who don't share the concerns of the poor. We, as a group, have put considerable time and energy and thought into new approaches to helping restore our cities, renewing the hopes and dreams of those who live on some of America's meanest streets and meanest neighborhoods, addressing their concerns for the need for community empowerment, for strengthening families. 
Several years ago, I introduced a package of proposals under the title of `Projects for American Renewal.' It attempted, through a series of initiatives of Federal seeding and Federal support, demonstration programs, and grants, to accomplish a number of things, but primarily falling in three areas: Strengthen families, because families are so key to the strength and stability of communities, but recognizing that not all families are intact; and promoting the role of mentors, organizations and individuals that can provide support for children who don't have fathers at home to help them. It addressed the need for strengthening those community institutions--institutions of charities and nonprofits, churches, synagogues, and other institutions within the community that can reach out and address some of these most fundamental social programs in ways that government programs never have and never will. 
It sought to provide for community renewal through a series of empowerment measures and economic empowerment measures designed to gather capital, build businesses, and provide job opportunity and job growth for businesses within communities that needed the help the most. 
For the past 18 months, a group of us have been meeting under the title of `Renewal Alliance,' a group of roughly 30 Republican Members of the House and Senate seeking to craft a new program of outreach and empowerment to our Nation's urban areas and to our Nation's poor. We have rejected the failed model of the past, the top-down Federal programs that have brought devastation in inner-city communities. We have also, however, rejected a `hands off' approach that believes the best Federal urban policy is no policy at all. 
Instead, we have attempted, through the Renewal Alliance, to provide an opportunity agenda for urban America. We acknowledge that there is at least a startup role that the Federal Government can play, primarily through the Tax Code changes and through some seed money, but we also want to make sure that the role of the Government is that of a supporter and an encourager and a partner to local leaders and institutions who know firsthand what America's urban problems are and are already well on their way to finding solutions. 
It is clear to us that from the range and complexity of problems plaguing our inner cities, that capital development--social, human, and economic capital--is the key to the long-term renewal of urban communities. 
Our plan addresses this problem at three levels. First, through a charity tax credit and an expanded charitable choice program, we shift authority and resources away from government and toward those private charitable, religious, and voluntary organizations that undergird the life of local communities. We support private economic development through targeted tax incentives and regulatory relief. And we address the dramatic educational defects of urban schools by providing publicly funded scholarships for poor children to attend schools of their choice. 
I will take a few minutes--with the indulgence of the proponent of this amendment, my good friend, the Senator from Kentucky--to in more detail describe the Renewal Alliance agenda and its vision for urban America. 
First let me talk about community empowerment. Community activist Bob Woodson said there is no social program in America today that is not being solved somewhere by someone. The most intractable problems we face--drug addiction, teen pregnancy, homelessness, youth violence--are being conquered by community leaders most of us have never heard of. Pastor Freddie Garcia of San Antonio has a drug treatment program that has an 80 percent success rate, compared to the single-digit performance of government programs. An independent study of Big Brothers-Big Sisters found among at-risk youth, adult mentoring cut first-time drug use by 46 percent, school absenteeism by 52 percent, and violent behavior by a third. 
These are just two of hundreds of examples of programs and individuals involved in leading those programs that are making a difference in dealing with these difficult social problems that plague different communities, neighborhoods, and families in America. 
We propose a package of reforms that will strengthen these institutions, these charities, these volunteer groups, that bind communities together and actually heal individual lives. We want to continue the work of the 1996 welfare reform by encouraging States to transfer more authority and resources to the private nonprofit groups and religious groups through State-based charity tax credits. 
Our bill also expands and strengthens the charitable provisions contained in the 1996 welfare bill to permit faith-based institutions to compete for all types of Federal human services contracts. The Community Empowerment Initiative also builds on last year's Volunteer Protection Act by limiting the liability of businesses that provide equipment or facilities for use by charitable organizations. 
The second component of our Renewal Alliance program is economic empowerment. One of the great underreported stories of America's booming economy is the fact that tight labor markets are increasingly forcing businesses to look to inner cities for labor. In Wisconsin, Allen-Edmonds Shoes last year moved a major facility from Port Washington to inner-city Milwaukee to take advantage of the untapped labor pool there. The city of Indianapolis has engaged in an aggressive program to bring businesses into poor neighborhoods by reducing regulations and promoting the relative lack of economic competition in inner-city communities. 
Our legislation wants to build on these trends. We target the 100 poorest communities in our Nation with tax and 
regulatory relief designed to spur economic growth on a long-term basis. Our plan reduces to zero the capital gains tax for investments in troubled areas, increases the expensive plants and equipment purchases by small businesses in the zones, and allows businesses in these zones to receive a 20 percent wage credit for hiring qualified low-income workers. To qualify for these benefits, States and localities must agree to reduce local tax rates and fees within the renewal community and to waive local and State occupational licensing regulations. The proposal would also create family development accounts that encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or of their EITC refunds, to be matched by private contributions which would be available for the purchase of a home, education expenses, or creation of a small business. 
The third part of our program is educational choice for low-income families. The recent survey on urban education by Education Week reemphasized the alarming state of our urban schools. Nationwide, just 43 percent of students attending urban schools meet the most minimal standards for reading comprehension. In schools in high poverty areas, only 23 percent meet the basic standard. This pattern held true in math and science, as well as reading. 
Urban parents whose children are trapped in schools in which failure is virtually guaranteed are increasingly demanding real change and real alternatives. Publicly and privately financed scholarship programs are now operating at over 30 cities. Early studies of these programs show substantial academic improvement among participating students and a sharp jump in parental satisfaction with the education their children are receiving are the results and consequences of these initiatives. 
Our legislation tackles the education problems faced by inner-city children from two different angles. First, we call for a large-scale test of publicly funded scholarships for poor children. We believe these scholarships would provide some immediate relief for families and inject badly needed competition in the public school system. The scholarships would also put real pressure on the public system for real reform as families begin shopping for schools that work. I am pleased to offer these initiatives here on the Senate floor with Senator Lieberman on a bipartisan basis in the past several years, and we want to continue to do that. 
The second part of the renewal education reform plan is targeted at relieving the regulatory burden faced by urban schools. Administrators routinely complain that although the Federal Government provides only a fraction of overall education funding, it imposes an overwhelming majority of the paperwork. Our bill would provide an education flex waiver for urban school districts that will permit them to devote more of their dollars to the classroom and less time filling out forms. 
This is the Renewal Alliance plan in brief: To restore urban America, community empowerment, economic renewal, educational choice, and reform. We do so not by putting the Federal Government in charge, but by bringing it alongside as a supporter of those individuals and those civic institutions, nonprofits, churches and charities, synagogues and parishes, that are already at work rebuilding lives and rebuilding neighborhoods. 
Mr. President, I will vote for the McConnell amendment. I believe the constitutional case for it is compelling. The Senator from Kentucky has crafted a measure that I believe addresses the issue of encouraging participation by the underprivileged of taking advantage of the highway funding that will result from passage of this bill. But I don't want this vote to be interpreted as the answer to the problems that affect the underprivileged, the answer to the problem that affects our communities. We need to do much more. We need a much more comprehensive effort. 
The Renewal Alliance has proposed such an effort. It is not written in stone. It is open to amendment. It is open to suggestion. It doesn't answer the whole problem, but it moves us in a substantial direction toward solving that problem. I'm going to discuss this in greater detail. We will be offering this legislative package. We will be exploring opportunities throughout this legislative session to debate and vote on all or some of this package of proposals. 
I am joined by a number of my colleagues here in the Senate. I hate to start naming names, but key among them are Senator Santorum and Senator Abraham. We are working with an expanded group of Senators who have real concerns and want to propose real solutions to some of the most difficult problems we face as a Nation. 
So with that, Mr. President, we will be saying more and doing more on this initiative in the future, but I wanted to take this opportunity to at least inform our colleagues that this vote is simply the opening foray into an area that I think the Senate needs to seriously address and give serious debate and initiatives toward solving. I look forward to the opportunity to continue this effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. That is precisely what I was saying. I appreciate the Senator's experience and involvement with programs that are locally based and really make a difference in people's lives. What I was trying to say here is that we are faced with a situation where we have a statute on the books that appears to be unconstitutional. I think it goes against the grain of equal treatment under the law--something that is the foundation for what this country believes in. But I didn't want to misinterpret it as the attempt, this year, by the U.S. Senate or U.S. Congress in addressing problems that affect people that are called `underprivileged' or `low-income' or `minorities' or people who live in targeted urban areas. There are deeper problems. There are problems that have defied the Federal solution and have defied the legislative solution but have lent themselves to local solutions, often faith-based solutions, or nonprofit, charitable solutions that we can't write statutes for. Can we assist in the transition of moving the Government from a `one-size-fits-all, let Washington solve the problem,' to an aspect of greater involvement of these organizations in dealing with these problems? I think we can. What we are trying to do here is outline some steps that we believe we should take in order to accomplish that. 
I appreciate the continued support of the Senator from Alabama and his interest in this and his experience in this. I welcome his participation, as he has offered in the past and I know he will in the future, in terms of our Renewal Alliance efforts.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, yesterday the senate voted to confirm Judge Richard Young to be U.S. district judge for the southern district of Indiana. I rise today to express my strong support for the senate's actions. Judge Young has distinguished himself both professionally and in community service, and it is my honor to commend him to the senate as an excellent choice for the federal bench. 
Judge Young has earned an outstanding reputation through his eight years as Vanderburgh circuit court judge, and as a trial attorney for 10 years before that. He has broad legal background, both in his job as judge, and in professional organizations. Currently a member of the board of directors of the Indiana judicial conference, Judge Young also is the former president of the Evansville Bar Association. In addition, it is significant to note that Judge Young has worked in the Department of Justice, and has served as a public defender in Vanderburgh county. 
During his time as judge, Judge Young has shown himself to be a diligent worker, handling in a recent year 79 jury trials. 
However, it is not only Judge Young's extensive experience and excellent work ethic that make me confident he will bring sound, solid hoosier values to the federal bench. Judge Young also has a proven record of dedication to community service. Before he took the bench, Judge Young served on the board of trustees of the museum of arts and science of the community foundation, and the community corrections advisory board. Judge young has also served in the Easter Seals Society and has had a role in supporting the Evansville rehabilitation center. 
Clearly, Judge Young is a dedicated practitioner of jurisprudence and dedicated servant of his community. I am confident he will be an excellent judge and a credit to the state of Indiana, and it is for this reason I offer my support of his nomination to the federal bench.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I don't anticipate consuming more than about 5 or 6 minutes. 
Madam President, I come before my colleagues today with a sense of duality regarding the measure we have before us. On the one hand, the line-item veto override contains two items that are very important to me and to the State of Indiana, and also important to the national defense of our country. On the other hand, embodied in this line-item veto override is a fundamental question that goes to the very root of the principle of the Line-Item Veto Act. That question is whether Congress will abandon the longstanding practice of chasing good money with bad money, of holding worthy projects hostage to unnecessary funding. 
So, for me, this vote represents a choice of parochialism and a choice of principle--the former rooted in the hard realities of the military construction process and the latter rooted in the Line-Item Veto Act and the critical necessity of fiscal discipline. 
During the markup of the fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations bill, a preestablished criteria, jointly agreed upon by Congress and the Pentagon, was used to determine what projects would be funded. 
There were four criteria: 
First, is this project consistent with past action? 
Secondly, is the project requested in the future years' defense plan? 
Third, is the project necessary for reasons of national security? 
Fourth, could a contract be awarded for construction of the project during the next fiscal year, this being fiscal year 1998? 
However, the Congress ultimately appropriated five projects that did not meet the jointly established criteria. The President abandoned this criteria when determining which projects he would veto. Thus, both the legislative and executive branches were guilty of abandoning the fiscal discipline established under the joint criteria. 
Madam President, I assert that it is impossible to have a disciplined, consistent budget process if the Congress and the White House can't stick with a preestablished plan. 
You see, further aggravating this situation is that, following the President's veto, there came admissions from the White House that errors had been made in evaluating projects for the veto, errors beyond the obvious abandonment of the joint criteria. This is of particular frustration to this Member, as two of the projects that were incorrectly vetoed reside in my home State. 
However, the Congress has a veto override process designed to address such situations. That is what we wrote into the law. But in an act of regression to past fiscal habits, the override resolution before us today contains those five projects that didn't meet the criteria in the first place, totaling $50 million, that, as I said, failed to meet the criteria, the preestablished criteria. 
One is tempted to conclude--and maybe the only conclusion is--it's business as usual. It is just an indication of how extraordinarily difficult it is for Members of Congress, all of us, to curb our compulsion for spending taxpayer dollars. 
In this case, the cost of abuse is compounded because the game is being played with our national security at stake. 
A maintenance facility for chemical and biological warfare detection devices at Crane naval surface warfare center, and a civil engineering center a Grissom air reserve base are included in this resolution. Both projects are in my home state, and both meet the joint criteria. 
The Crane chemical/biological detection center, a $4 million project, relates to a mission shortfall in chemical and biological warfare detection capabilities that should be built as soon as possible. 
It would address the Navy's growing need to provide maintenance and support for chemical and biological warfare detection devices aboard surface ships such as those deployed in the Persian gulf today. 
Current facilities are inadequate and lack the required environmental controls. The Navy supports the project and local officials have already entered into a contract for the design of the facility. 
So it meets the criteria that we established. 
I want to inform my colleagues and the Members of the Indiana delegation, those who work at Crane, the Department of the Navy, that I intend to work with them expeditiously and as conscientiously as I can, along with the Secretary of Defense and the Department of the Air Force, to accelerate this Crane project--not just support but to accelerate, as well as the Grissom Project, in an effort to ensure that our national defense capabilities are not weakened as a result of the cancellation of these projects. 
However, as I previously stated, there is embodied in this resolution the violation of a principle basic to the line-item veto, a principle of fiscal discipline and restraint. 
Senator McCain and I fought a long battle for passage of the Line-Item Veto Act. We did so in the belief that it would apply a measure of discipline to a Congress that seemed consumed by a spending habit, and particularly egregious--a practice which loaded otherwise meritorious acceptable spending with that which had not met the criteria and gained the support of a majority of Members of Congress in an up-or-down vote, or straightforward debate on that particular item, but attached to something that was popular, attached to something that was needed with the intent of having it ride through on the train of something that was important. Unfortunately, the resolution before us today embodies that same practice, that same budget chicanery that has taken place in the past. 
Though there are many projects of merit contained in this resolution, these meritorious projects are being used to spirit through those that are without merit. 
This resolution is a missed opportunity. As the Supreme Court readies itself to ponder the final fate of the Line Item Veto Act, Congress had the opportunity to send the President a resolution that embodied the principle and the practice of fiscal discipline. Instead, we have squandered this opportunity by providing legislation handicapped by fiscal indiscipline. 
Mr. President, though I am disappointed in this particular measure, I firmly believe that it demonstrates that the line item veto process is both practical and constitutional. 
Judge Hogan has now placed the final question on the Line Item Veto Act before the Supreme Court. As such, I would like to comment briefly on the constitutional strength of the measure. 
I believe that the Line Item Veto Act conforms to the presentment clause of the Constitution and that Congress is within its constitutional right in granting to the President the authority to rescind, or withhold from obligation, spending, as he administers the law. 
As Walter Dellinger, then assistant attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee: `Unlike line item veto bills that our office previously found unconstitutional, S. 4 would not violate any aspect of the presentment clause: It would not authorize the President to veto some portions of a bill and also sign the remaining portions into law. Rather, it would permit the President to rescind discretionary spending after the enactment of an appropriations act that would remain law. Such rescission authority would not implicate the specific textual requirements of Article I, Section 7: It would apply to the administration by the executive of a duly enacted law, not to the constitutionally prescribed procedures for a bill's enactment.' 
Timothy Flanigan, a former assistant attorney general during the Bush administration went further, stating that:  
This approach avoids the presentment clause problems . . . by doing nothing to alter how an appropriations or spending bill becomes law. It would not alter the presentment process but instead authorizes the President to rescind specific spending items, unless Congress within a certain time acts to approve that particular item. 
The process established by the Line Item Veto Act is not new. Rather, it is the essential restoration of a budget process that existed prior to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. 
On the delegation of powers question, just as Gramm-Rudman survived constitutional scrutiny, so shall the Line Item Veto Act. In that case, the courts ruled that appropriations power was not distinguishable from other powers that had been successfully delegated in the past. The court equated Congress' power to appropriate with the power to tax. Taxing power has been successfully delegated in the past. 
I am confident that the Line Item Veto Act is fully constitutional. 
Opponents of the line item veto have long argued that any such measure could face constitutional challenges in two key areas. They suggest that a line item veto may violate the presentment clause because a bill no longer would be signed or vetoed in whole, but in part. Secondly, they suggest that the line item veto represents an unconstitutional delegation of Congress' power of the purse. The district court bought into this argument, and the supreme court will now have final say on the question. 
The Line Item Veto Act clearly meets the presentment clause standard. It does not allow the President to individually veto sections of a bill when it is presented to him. Rather, the act grants the President authority to rescind, or withhold from obligation, spending, as he administers the law. 
In hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Walter Dellinger, former Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice testified about the line item veto:  
Unlike Line Item Veto Bills that our office previously found unconstitutional, S. 4 would not violate any aspect of the presentment clause: It would not authorize the president to veto some portions of a bill and also to sign the remaining portions into law. Rather, S. 4 would permit the president to rescind discretionary spending after the enactment of an appropriations act that would remain the law. Such rescission authority would not implicate the specific textual requirements of article I, section 7: It would apply to the administration by the executive of a duly enacted law, not to the constitutionally prescribed procedures for a bill's enactment. Our office has carefully reviewed S. 4 and concluded that it is constitutional. 
In fact, Timothy Flanigan, former Assistant Attorney General during the Bush Administration, testified that of the various line item veto proposals, enhanced rescission is on the strongest footing constitutionally. 
A far more promising legislative proposal, S 4, the Dole-McCain-Coats legislative Line Item Veto Act of 1995, is aimed at giving the President greater control over the expenditure of funds. This approach avoids the presentment clause problems by doing nothing to alter how an appropriations or spending bill becomes law. Senator Dole's bill would not alter the presentment process but instead authorizes the President to rescind specific spending items, unless Congress within a certain time acts to approve that particular item. A statute of that type would amount to a restoration to the President of power taken by Congress during the Nixon Presidency in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. 
Just as the Line Item Veto Act meets the presentment clause challenge, it in no way exceeds Congress' constitutional Authority to delegate its functions to the Executive. 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings survived a constitutional challenge. The courts ruled that appropriations power was not functionally distinguishable from other powers that had been successfully delegated in the past. The court noted that Congress' power to appropriate was particularly akin to its power to tax which has been successfully delegated in the past. 
In 1989, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected a plea that Congress' power to tax may not be delegated, the court stated: 
Article I, section 8 of the Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress. First in place among these enumerated powers is the `power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imports and excises . . .' We discern nothing in the placement of the taxing clause that would distinguish Congress' power to tax from its other enumerated powers . . . in terms of the scope and degree of discretionary authority that Congress may delegate to the executive. . . . (Skinner v. MidAmerica Pipeline Co., 109 S. Ct. 1726, 1732, 1733 (1989). 
Walter Dellenger testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
Although [delegation] is a significant constitutional issue, we are confident that the Supreme Court would sustain S. 4 or similar legislation. It is well established that Congress may delegate sweeping discretionary powers to the executive, including powers that related directly to the nation's fiscal policy. For example, Congress may authorize the President to raise or lower tariffs, to set the price of agricultural commodities, or to recover excess wartime profits. Indeed, on only two occasions--both of which occurred nearly sixty years ago--has the Supreme Court struck down a statute on the grounds that it impermissibly delegated power to the President. 
Timothy Flannigan added, 
Although this type of bill has previously been attacked on the ground that it would constitute an unconstitutional delegation of congressional power, there is no foundation in the constitution for that claim. The constitution requires that no money be drawn from the treasury except `in consequence of appropriations made by law,' (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7), but there is no requirement that the President spend all moneys that are appropriated. Indeed, such a policy would either encourage gross fiscal irresponsibility by the President or would require Congress to micromanage all aspects of Federal procurement. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires either result. [Timonthy Flannigan, Subcommittee of the Constitution, Senate Judiciary Committee, January 17, 1995]. 
I am confident that the Line Item Veto Act is constitutionally sound and that it will be upheld by the Supreme Court. 
Let me conclude by stating that I am saddened to be confronted with a resolution that places my principles in conflict with the interest of my State. However, we are entrusted by the people who elected us to make the tough decisions that will ensure the long-term health, security, and fiscal soundness of this great Nation. As such, I cannot support a resolution that continues the fiscal chicanery of the past. Thus I must vote against it, and urge its defeat. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1601, a bill that would end the cloning of human beings. I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor this legislation. 
Many opponents of the bill will label its supporters as anti-technology, anti-science--seeking to return to the dark days of ages past. Such opponents have conveniently seized on a notion that to ban this emerging technological procedure is to despise all science and progress. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Just 80 days ago, two of the primary sponsors of this bill--Senators Frist and Gregg--and I completed three years of intense work on the FDA Modernization Act, whose sole purpose was to advance the health of patients by supporting and promoting the extraordinary, life-saving work of high-technology biotech companies and drug firms. It is too convenient--indeed, it is dishonest--for opponents to charge supporters of this cloning bill with being anti-science, anti-patient. 
Indeed, we who believe human life to be one of the greatest gifts from our Creator, do not fear the development of science and technology that protects and improves that life. We know only too well of the advances in medicine and vaccines that have dramatically reduced infant deaths. We have held hearings in which extraordinary PET technology can reveal the workings of the prenatal and postnatal brain. We have constituent companies whose fetal bladder stents now save the lives of women and their children, when death used to be a certainty. 
But to admire, promote, and legislate on behalf of patient-friendly technology, and scientific achievement does not require that we sacrifice all principle or that we abandon caution in the face of serious questions about a particular technology. 
Few will disagree that cloning presents this country with one of the most disturbing and tantalizing scientific developments in recent time. 
At once, it presents us with the opportunity to duplicate, triplicate, infinitely replicate the best that the world has to offer; and it presents the threat of too much of a good thing--the loss of individuality and the end of the security and utility inherent in diversity. Indeed, the child is now created in our own image and not God's. It becomes a product of the will and not the receipt of gift. Who can predict the emotional, the psychological, or the spiritual consequences of such a technolgy? 
Cloning technology, so new to the human experience, indeed considered just ten or fifteen years ago to be practically and scientifically unachievable, has received only scant attention from the most distinguished, thoughtful, and expert-laden institutions in our society. Even today, cloning of humans is still considered only a remote possibility by means as yet untested and only barely imaginable. 
Because it differs so dramatically from in vitro fertilization and other methods of reproduction, we can scarcely begin to set forth some of the practical consequences: a reduction in genetic diversity, long considered essential to the species; an increase in deformities in the child. The possibilities are numerous and unexplored. 
Proponents of cloning argue that in the face of these possibilities, caution is required. But while cloning proponents call for caution that protects experimentation, the better course is caution that protects the developing human embryos that are inevitably created by such technology. 
How in good conscience can we wait for the practical and ethical complications of cloning to develop--to wait for Dr. Richard Seed to use methods that unavoidably involve the destruction of living human embryos? 
Perhaps in the meantime research on animal cloning will result in the cloning technology that can be used to develop human cell lines or tissue that is not derived from a developing human embryo or does not result first in the creation of such an embryo. Again, until that day, caution is required--caution in defense of life.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, over the past 3 weeks or so, Independent Counsel Ken Starr has been the subject of a sustained attack by individuals speaking on behalf of the President. Judging by some of these statements, it seems there is little that the President's surrogates are unwilling to say about Judge Starr. The objective of these comments seems clear--to undermine public confidence in the very legal processes designed to assure public integrity in the White House. 
In an extraordinary televised interview, the First Lady accused the independent counsel of being `politically motivated' by an investigation of the Monica Lewinsky matter and part of a `vast right-wing conspiracy' to bring down the President. Other Presidential advisors have also taken to the airwaves, attacking Kenneth Starr as a `scumbag,' and `merchant of sleaze.' One of these advisors went so far as to declare war on Judge Starr and the Office of the Independent Counsel. 
Now these tactics bring to mind the old adage known to every trial lawyer in the country: When you have the facts, argue the facts; when you have the law, argue the law; and when you have neither the facts nor the law, go after the prosecutor, go after the witnesses, go after the accuser, attack their credibility. 
Yesterday in the Wall Street Journal in an editorial entitled `Spinning Starr,' the editors state: 
Events of recent days suggest that an analysis by Mr. Clinton's legal team has concluded that their strongest strategy is not to meet on the battlefield of facts and law, but to conduct a political offensive against the independent counsel and his staff. 
No matter what opposition they've encountered--Paula Jones, Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey, Fred Thompson, Judge Royce Lamberth--the Clinton side has always chosen the same strategy of stonewalling, smash-mouth lawyering. 
Madam President, for those of us who know Ken Starr and have watched and appreciated his distinguished career, the picture painted of this man by the President's people is virtually unrecognizable. 
The President's people have asked us to forget Kenneth Starr's exemplary personal character, his service as the Nation's Solicitor General, and his tenure in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
The President's people have asked us to forget the reputation he has gained for fairness and balance and good judgment that he earned through working with the Justice Department. 
The President's people have asked us to forget the unpopular chances he took in defending freedom of the press and freedom of religion during his tenure as a Federal judge. 
And most of all, the President's people have asked us to forget that Kenneth Starr has brought to the independent counsel's office the cautious, deliberative mind of a judge and not the zeal of a prosecutor. 
The President's attack machine has left us not with a caricature of Ken Starr but with a smudge: Kenneth Starr, right-wing conspirator, partisan prosecutor, Republican hack. 
Madam President, there is too much hanging in the balance of this investigation to permit these attacks on Judge Starr's character and reputation to go unchallenged. The fact is that even some of Kenneth Starr's most committed ideological opponents have in earlier times painted a very different picture of the man who is now at the receiving end of so much of the Clinton fury. 
Some of you may have heard of Walter Dellinger. He is a professor of law at Duke University, a liberal democrat and the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel under Attorney General Janet Reno. When Kenneth Starr was chosen as independent counsel, Professor Dellinger said, `I have known Ken Starr since he was one of my students at Duke Law School and I have always known him to be a fair-minded person.' 
An official with the American Civil Liberties Union said of Starr's appointment, `I'd rather have him investigate me than almost anyone I could think of.' 
Alan Morrison, the cofounder of Public Citizen Litigation Group told Time magazine last week that the idea of Kenneth Starr as a right-wing avenger is `not the Ken Starr I know.' 
When Democrats criticized Judge Starr's appointment as politically inspired, five former presidents of the American Bar Association refused to call for his resignation, citing their `Utmost confidence in his integrity and his objectivity.' 
Just last week, Robert Bork, one of the sternest critics of the independent counsel law, wrote that the Office of the Independent Counsel `requires but does not always get an independent counsel of moral strength and judicial temperament. Kenneth Starr is just such a prosecutor * * * He has conducted himself professionally and without a credible hint of partisanship.' 
The worlds of Kenneth Starr and the Clinton White House are completely different. The independent counsel has a reputation for integrity and fairness. He is temperate by nature and has been criticized by his own staff as being deliberative to a fault. Kenneth Starr regards justice not as a matter of winning or losing but as a search for the truth. 
Madam President, if there is ever a time when we need an impartial independent search for the truth, this is that time. A great deal does hang in the balance. We have important decisions to make relative to foreign policy of this Nation and the domestic policy of this Nation. It is important that we be able to rest credibility and trust in the Office of the Presidency. It is important that we elicit the facts and the truth relative to the allegations swirling around the President and the White House at this particular time. 
I can think of no fairer minded nor nonpartisan, capable individual than the current independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and I think it would be appropriate if all of us let him do his job. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you for trading places with me so that I could come down and make remarks regarding the nomination. 
First of all, I want to commend the Senator for conducting what I think is an informative and factual and civil debate on this very important nomination. 
We have over the past several years had some very controversial Surgeon General discussions and debates on this floor. The previous Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, was controversial, to say the least, and resigned after one of her more controversial actions. Then, subsequent to that, one of the nominees for that position failed to achieve majority support in the U.S. Senate and withdrew his name. So that is the position that has been open for some time. 
Earlier, Mr. President, a speaker on the floor said that those who oppose this nomination never mentioned the experience and the qualifications and the life experiences of Dr. Satcher--his help for children, women, and the poor and disadvantaged. That is not true, at least in my experience, having been in the Chair for the last hour and a half. I think each speaker I have heard has acknowledged Dr. Satcher's fairly remarkable life experience in terms of providing help to people; in terms of dedicating his life to advancing the cause of medicine. He is an engaging person. He is a fine person with a history of achievements at the institutions for which he has worked. 
My personal meetings with him in my office have been cordial and informative, and his presentation before the Labor and Human Resources Committee on which I sit was also one of cordiality and civility. But, Mr. President, those are not just the qualifications for someone to occupy the position of Surgeon General. Cordiality and life experiences in the ability to be, as someone said and I have said on previous occasions, the Nation's doctor are important qualifications but there are other criteria by which I believe it is important Members make the determination. I cannot speak for other Members. They can and will speak for themselves. However, I can state to the Senate and to the people I represent why I intend to cast my vote tomorrow in opposition to the nomination of Dr. Satcher. It is based on the committee hearings we have had. It is based on the answers to questions that I personally proposed to Dr. Satcher. My opposition is based on his answers to some of the questions I have raised during meetings which I have conducted in my office. Other Members have spoken on issues that have been of concern to me--his involvement and his role in the AIDS trials in Africa, his support for needle exchange programs, his inability to state clearly the relative importance of abstinence by children and avoiding drug use by teens. 
I will leave further details of those issues to others. The Senator from Missouri has already touched on some of those, as have others. Each of those matters could be potentially disqualifying. The accumulation of those matters could be disqualifying. But for me ultimately my opposition to the nominee is based on his support for a practice that I consider indefensible, partial-birth abortion, a practice which we now know is brutal killing of a living child who has been partially delivered from the mother. 
Some have claimed that the nominee has not in fact stated that he opposes legislation to ban this practice, and he made that statement to me. But I need to read from the following exchange of the nominee with my office as was printed in the hearing record and available on the committee's web site.

Mr. COATS. Please indicate, Dr. Satcher, whether you support the President's recent veto of legislation regulating partial-birth abortion. 
Dr. Satcher's brief but critical reply: 
I support the President's position. 
Mr. President, I cannot support someone who supports that position. Some have claimed that they expect the nominee won't do anything to further advance the President's position on this question. But it is precisely on a matter so crucial to defining who we are as a nation and who we are as a people that I expect, and the qualifying criteria for me, is that our Nation's doctor show some independence and integrity on this question. I can understand why a nominee feels compelled to `support the President's position.' But this is a matter of such fundamental importance, of such defining importance that I believe each has to speak their own moral conscience on the matter and come to their own conclusion regardless of the political consequences or any other implications. 
Whether or not you will be an advocate or not an advocate for a position is not the criteria. The question is, what is your position on this, the most critical of all and the most defining of all issues, the issue of life itself. By supporting a procedure that I personally consider infanticide, this nominee has in fact joined forces with those who would create questions about whether or not that is the case, who supports without qualification a radical procedure that is not justifiable in any case except to save the life of the mother, and we have heard testimony from witness after witness, medical provider after medical provider, expert after expert, that it has never been the case that it is necessary to utilize the procedure of partial-birth abortion to save the life of the mother. 
It is a grotesque practice. It has been described in this Chamber. It is not justifiable for any medical reasons, and yet that is the reason why it is defined here. 
Mr. President, we need a Nation's doctor who unequivocally stands for, speaks for, advocates life itself, the sacredness of life itself and who will not hedge that qualification with an answer that simply says, I support the position of the President. Whether that person privately supports that position or not is irrelevant. That person is a public figure. The Surgeon General is the doctor to whom the Nation looks for advice and counsel on medical matters. He speaks, he advocates for those issues, and that someone says on this issue, I simply support the President's position, is unacceptable to this Senator because the President's position is unacceptable to this Senator. 
So for that reason, Mr. President, I oppose this nomination and intend to do so when we vote tomorrow. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we were privileged to be led in our opening prayer today by Reverend Dr. Neal Jones, a fancy title for some of us who know him as `Pastor Jones.' I think `pastor' is probably the most affectionate and endearing term that anyone can come up with in terms of someone that they feel close to and have had a relationship with. People know the Reverend Dr. Neal Jones as Pastor Jones because of his dedicated service as pastor of Columbia Baptist Church in Falls Church, Virginia, for many, many years. He has been pastor to me and my family, the majority leader and his family, the President pro tempore and his family, and others of our colleagues in both the Senate and the House. 
`Pastor' is the appropriate word because of his love and his affection and his endearment that he has displayed toward us and our families. And we feel exactly the same way about him. 
Dr. Jones is a graduate of Texas Christian University, and Southwest Baptist Theological Seminary. He has been pastor of churches in Texas, but the primary focus of his ministry has been with Columbia Baptist Church in Falls Church, Virginia going back as far as March of 1969. 
He is currently retired. It is a loss to the people who have attended faithfully over the years Columbia Baptist Church. 
But, again, to his dear wife, Betty, and his family and his grandchildren, and the many organizations that he has been associated with and continues to be associated with--I will just name two of those: He is a member of the University Board of Regents at Baylor University in Texas, and has been on the 
Executive Board of Prison Fellowship from its very inception. 
Reverend Jones has a gift of prayer, and, as we heard this morning, an eloquence in prayer. I hope someday, if he has not already, that he will publish those prayers because they are exceptional. 
And he also has the gift of remembering those with whom he has come in contact with. Every once in a while I will receive a note with a prayer attached to it personalized to me and to our family, `Just thinking of you, wanted to share this thought, your friend, Neal.' I think that speaks as much about Neal Jones as anything else that I can say. 
I think the Senate is privileged and the Nation is privileged this morning to have had him lead us in our opening prayer. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Arizona in introducing legislation directing the Congressional Research Service to make available, on-line, CRS Reports, Issue Briefs, and more comprehensive CRS reports on federal authorizations and appropriations. 
CRS is funded with over $64 million in taxpayer money every year and produces perhaps the most prolific and quality research available on policy and legislative issues. In making available information and materials that are used every day by Members and their staffs in developing policy initiatives and legislation, we will be opening a more informed relationship between the American people and the Congress that serves them. 
Beyond the tremendous value of informing the American people on the issues before their Congress, this legislation will help to shine some light on the federal government, allowing the American people to see the documents which influence the decision-making process. 
Mr. President, FDR once said that, `The only bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interest of the people, and people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over its government.' At a time when public cynicism about government is at an all-time high, when government has encroached upon virtually every aspect of our daily lives, this statement is particularly poignant. 
As I have stated, CRS information briefs play a critical role in assisting Members of Congress in policy development and the legislative process. By making these products readily available to the American people, who pay for them, we hold out the promise of demystifying a legislative process that has become so complex and arcane that many Americans have simply tuned out. 
Mr. President, more than ever, information is power. It is my hope that the effect of this legislation will be to give a better informed public more power over their government. 
My intention today is to keep my remarks short. As this legislation moves through the process, I will ask my colleagues to indulge me with more time to discuss the bill in detail. I would like to commend Senator McCain for his leadership on this issue, and to ask my colleagues for their support in this effort to make the Congress more accessible to the people. I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on Tuesday of this week, our Nation celebrated Veterans Day. I had the pleasure of returning to Indiana and talking to some of our veterans and speaking to an important group about the meaning of Veterans Day and the contributions veterans have made to our country and their sacrifices. We honor Americans on that day, both men and women, who served in both peace and war, as watchmen and women on the wall of freedom. We honor them by remembering their heroism, passing stories of their character and courage from generation to generation. 
It is disappointing and extremely unfortunate that in this very same week the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Ms. Sara Lister, made some remarks to a group to whom she was speaking at Harvard, referring to members of the U.S. Marine Corps as `extremists.' I quote her. She says the Marines are `extremists. Wherever you have extremists, you've got some risks of total disconnection with society. And that's a little dangerous.' 
Now, subsequently, Ms. Lister has penned a letter of apology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Krulak, in which she says it's unfortunate that my remarks were taken out of context. It's unfortunate that they were misinterpreted. 
Now, all of us in the business of politics have had occasion to pick up the paper in the morning and seen our remarks taken out of context and be misinterpreted. So I appreciate that this sort of thing often takes place. I truly hope that in this case these remarks were taken out of context and that they were misinterpreted. I am concerned that they were not. I have asked for a tape or transcript of the presentation by Ms. Lister at the Harvard group so that I can understand the context. It is not really understandable or discernible at this particular point. 
I am disturbed that one of our top civilian appointees at the Pentagon could make such a statement. It is hard for me to construct any context in which the use of the word `extremism,' and the phrase a `total disconnection between our society' and the U.S. Marine Corps is appropriate. I don't understand in what context that could be presented that would explain the use of those remarks and the statement that this is a `dangerous' situation. 
And so I rise today to raise serious questions about the continued leadership of Ms. Lister as Assistant Secretary of the Army. By her remarks, she has offended not only the 174,000 active duty members of the Marine Corps but the 2.1 million Marine Corps veterans and, frankly, all Americans. 
The Marine Corps teaches truths and convictions which are becoming more rare in today's society, and it is the continuity of these values in the Marine Corps which has produced men and women of character and honor who are ready and willing to sacrifice their lives in defense of their country. 
I would commend to Ms. Lister a piece which appeared in the Sunday Parade magazine, probably in most Sunday papers across our country. It featured a very insightful story of recruits in the Marine Corps and what we can learn from the Marine Corps. The article correctly shows that the Marine Corps teaches and trains young people important values. 
If these values are extremism, then I suggest that is what we need more of in this country. Let me just quote a few things from the article. 
In a society that seems to have trouble transmitting healthy values, the Marines stand out as a successful institution that unabashedly teaches those values . . . 
For the first time in their lives, many encountered absolute standards; tell the truth. Don't give up. Don't whine. Look out for the group before you look out for yourself. Always do your best . . . Judge others by their actions, not their words or their race. . . Don't pursue happiness; pursue excellence. Make a habit of that, and you can have a fulfilling life. 
The recruits learned that money isn't the measure of a man; that a person's real wealth is in his character. 
The recruits generally seemed to find race relations less of an issue at boot camp than in the neighborhoods they'd left behind. 
The author of the article goes on to say:  
If America were more like the Marines, argued a recruit from New Jersey, there would be less crime, less racial tension among people, because Marine Corps discipline is all about brotherhood. 
With their emphasis on honor, courage and commitment, they offer a powerful alternative to the loneliness and distrust that seem so widespread, especially among our youth. 
Well, Mr. President, if those values are a disconnect from American society, then it is not the Marine Corps that is in deep trouble. It is American society that is in deep trouble. These are the values to which we should be aspiring. I think under the leadership of General Krulak--and the tradition and the history of the Marines--the Marine Corps has demonstrated a continuing commitment to values to which we should all aspire. 
General Krulak responded to Ms. Lister's remarks--I will just briefly quote that--by saying that `honor, courage and commitment are not extreme.' 
Mr. President, as I said, I hope that these comments were taken out of context. I hope that they were misinterpreted. Again, I cannot conceive of a context in which they would be considered as appropriate. The use of the term `extremists', the statement that the Marine Corps is disconnected from American society reflects, unfortunately, an attitude and a belief about the Marine Corps and perhaps about others in uniform that is inappropriate for an Assistant Secretary of Defense. 
I note that Ms. Lister earlier had announced that at some point she was going to retire from her position. Perhaps it wouldn't be too early for her to think about accelerating that retirement so that the position could be turned over to someone who is able to present his thoughts in a better context, in a way that will not be misinterpreted. Perhaps then we will not have this difficult explanation of why one of our most honorable branches of military service has been labeled in such a way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

This isn't my call, but I ask the Senator if he could withhold until we can get some understanding of when that vote might be. It might be that it won't come before the Senator's 20 minutes, but if we add time here, 20 minutes there, and an additional 20 minutes, it could delay past the time when they now have commitments.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont has said, this is the first reform in 30 years at FDA. Obviously, a lot has changed in the industry. New drugs and new devices, new methods of bringing life-saving and health-improving benefits to the American people, and the people of the world. I think it is remarkable, particularly given the fact that it has been nearly 2 1/2 , 3 years now that we have been specifically working on this legislation in the committee, through a number of hearings, through a considerable, lengthy, and complex committee consideration, extensive floor debate. There were very difficult procedural hurdles to overcome and a difficult conference. We now arrive at this point with a bill that, very shortly, will be passed. This has only been done with a bipartisan effort. 
I want to return the compliment to the Senator from Maryland. I thank her for that. I am not sure that everyone is going to miss me around this place, given my role in this bill, in trying to bring it forward. But I thank her for her kind words. Senators Dodd, Mikulski, Harkin, and Wellstone joined Republicans in the committee to produce a bipartisan piece of legislation, and they supported us on the floor. I thank Senator Jeffords and his leadership, and Senator Gregg, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, and others on the Republican side, who contributed to the effort in moving the bill forward. 
I would be remiss not to acknowledge the extraordinary work of so many staff people that helped to move this forward. 
I thank my chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, and particularly Vince Ventimiglia, someone whose tireless efforts and thorough knowledge of the issues at hand, and at whose persistence we continued through all of the obstacles placed in the way of this legislation, and it was all accomplished in a manner of courtesy and respect, which is, unfortunately, all too rare around this place. He is an exceptional person. I don't believe we would be here without his efforts--even though he is not here right now; he is probably digging through the bill to make sure all the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted. He was exceptional in this whole effort. 
This bill provides help to the Food and Drug Administration, who did not have the capacity nor, I believe, in the past, the managerial leadership that allowed FDA to keep pace with the marvelous breakthroughs we have had in the pharmaceutical and medical device area, which brings life-saving benefits and health-improving benefits to people. Six-hundred additional people, paid for by the industry in a tax against them to reauthorize PDUFA, will help speed up the drug approval process. 
Now, for the first time, we give assistance to FDA on medical devices because we have a procedure where outside parties can, with FDA certification, approval and oversight, review medical device applications. This is going to provide for the medical device section what PDUFA provided for the drug section. This was a very critical part of the legislation, and I am pleased that it was retained in our efforts. 
We are here and it is a victory for the American people. It took a lot of effort by a lot of people. It is a testament to the persistence of many, some of whom are speaking here on the floor today. I am proud to play a role in this effort because I believe we are addressing some fundamental concerns, going to the very health and safety and very lives of the American people and people throughout the world. Mr. President, it is with that, I yield whatever remaining time I have.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleague Senator Lautenberg in introducing the JUMP Ahead Act of 1997. As a national board member of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, I know personally how important this legislation is, and the type of opportunity it will give to thousands of at-risk youth around the country. 
While intuitively we know that mentoring relationships can make a huge difference in the lives of young people, we now have scientifically reliable evidence about the positive impact that mentoring programs can have. In 1995, Public/Private Ventures, a policy research organization in Philadelphia, conducted an impact study of the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. The results were startling. The addition of a Big Brothers or Big Sister to a young person's life drastically reduced first time drug use, significantly lowered absenteeism, and reduced violent behavior. Furthermore, the young people studied were less likely to start using alcohol and more likely to do well in school.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, during Senate consideration of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 I, along with Senator James Exon, introduced an amendment to the Act which came to be known as the Communications Decency Act or CDA. This amendment held forth a basic principle, that children should be sheltered from obscene and indecent pornography. There was spirited debate on the amendment. However, ultimately the Senate adopted the CDA by an overwhelming margin of 84 to 16. 
On the very day that the President signed the Telecommunications Act into law, the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library Association, along with America On-Line and other representatives of the computer industry, filed a law suit against the CDA in District Court. In short, the case ultimately came before the Supreme Court, where it was struck down. 
Mr. President, however much I disagree with the ruling of the Supreme Court, it is reality and as such, I have studied the opinion of the Court and come before my colleagues today to introduce legislation that reflects the parameters laid out by the Court's opinion. 
Mr. President, during Congressional consideration of the CDA, opponents of the measure took what I like to call an ostrich approach. They stuck their head in the sand and their rear end in the air. 
With companies like America on Line and Microsoft in the forefront, there came an indignant claim from the computer industry that there was no problem with pornography on the Internet. They claimed that there was very little pornography, and that what exists is difficult to find. However incredulous, this is what they claimed. 
Well, Mr. President, this ostrich appears to have extricated its head from the sand. For after the Supreme Court's ruling, the computer industry, along with so-called civil liberties groups, gathered for a White House summit to address the issue of pornography on the net, and what could be done about it. There are now panels and working groups, media discussions and industry alternatives all designed to address this problem of the proliferation of pornography on the Internet and the threat it poses to our children. 
Mr. President, let me congratulate the computer industry, and welcome them to the real world. 
And what is this real world? Mr. President, I turn now to the February 10 edition of U.S. News and World Report. The cover story is entitled, `The Business of Porn.' The article outlines in rather disturbing clarity the issue of pornography in America. `Last year' it states, `America spent more than $8 billion on hard-core videos, peep shows, live sex acts, adult cable programming, sexual devices, computer porn, and sex magazines--an amount much larger than Hollywood's domestic box office receipts and larger than all the revenues generated by rock and country music recordings. Americans now spend more money at strip clubs than at Broadway, off-broadway, regional, and nonprofit theaters; at the opera, the ballet, and jazz and classical music performances combined.' 
This is truly alarming, and reflects poorly on the moral direction of the country. And, Mr. President, as the Internet continues to grow as a medium of communication and commerce in our society, its role in expanding the commerce of pornography increases exponentially. 
The Article goes on to say that: `In much the same way that hard-core films on videocassette were largely responsible for the rapid introduction of the VCR, porn on and CD-ROM and on the Internet has hastened acceptance of these new technologies. Interactive adult CD-ROMS, such as Virtual Valarie and the Penthouse Photo Shoot, create interest in multimedia equipment among male computer buyers.' It goes on: `Porn companies have established elaborate Web sites to lure customers . . . Playboy's web site, which offers free glimpses of its Playmates, now averages about 5 million hits a day.' 
The Article quotes Larry Flint, who says he `imagines a future in which the TV and the personal computer have merged. Americans will lie in bed, cruising the Internet with their remote controls and ordering hard-core films at the punch of a button. The Internet promises to combine the video store's diversity of choices with the secrecy of purchases through the mail.' 
Mr. President, there has been a virtual explosion of commerce in pornography on the Internet. Adult book stores, live peep shows, adult movies, you name it and it is there. It is available, Mr. President, not just to adults, but to children. 
And what does the computer industry, the ACLU, and the American Library Association tout as a solution to this problem? They tout self-ratings systems and blocking software. Opponents of the CDA, companies like America On-Line, the ACLU, the American Library Association, Larry Flint, have argued that there is no role for government in protecting children, that the Internet can regulate itself. The primary solution these people promote is system called PICs (Platform for Internet Content Selection), a type of self-ratings system. This would allow the pornographer to rate his own page, and browsers, the tool used to search the Internet, would then respond to these ratings. Aside from the ludicrous proposition of allowing the pornographer to self-rate, Mr. President, there is no incentive for compliance. 
I now turn to an editorial by writers in PC Week Magazine, a very prominent voice in the computer industry. The editorial is titled: `Web Site Ratings--Shame on Most of Us.' The column discusses the lack of voluntary compliance by content providers with the PICs system: `We and many others in the computer industry and press have decried the Communications Decency Act and other government attempts to regulate the content of the Web. Instead, we've all argued, the government should let the Web rate and regulate its own content. Page ratings and browsers that respond to those ratings, not legislation, are the answers we've offered.' 
The article goes on, `Too bad we left the field before the game was over.' the article says, `We who work around the Web have done little to rate our content.' it states that, in a search of the Web, they found `few rated sites.' And that rated sites were the `exception to the rule' In other words, PICs does not work. It does not work, because there is no incentive for pornographers to comply. 
And what about blocking software? Mr. President, let me begin by pointing out the amazing level of deceit that proponents of this solution are willing to go to. The American Library Association, a principal opponent of the CDA, lined up with plaintiffs in challenging the Constitutionality of the Act. It was a central argument of the Library Association and their cohorts, that blocking software presented a non-governmental solution to the problem. 
However, Mr. President, if one logs onto the American Library Association Web site one finds quite a surprise. Contained on the site is a resolution, adopted by the ALA Council on July 2, 1997, that resolves: `That the American Library Association affirms that the use of filtering software by libraries to block access . . . violates the Library Bill of Rights.' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this Resolution be inserted into the Record. 
So, here we find the true agenda of the American Library Association. They represent to the Court that everything is O.K., that all we need is blocking software. Then, they turn around and implement a policy that says no-way. 
And what are the implications? I quote now from a February 12, 1997 article in the Boston Herald. `John Hunt, a parent from Dorchester, said he was furious to learn his 11-year-old daughter was able to view pornography yesterday while working on a school essay at the BPL's Copley Square branch.' The article goes on: `She said all the boys were around the computer and they were laughing and called the girls over to look at the pictures of naked people,' Hunt said. `I want to find out from these library officials what is going on.' 
The article goes on to tell the story of another parent, Susan Sullivan who said she was stunned when her 10-year-old son spent the afternoon researching a book report on the computer in the BPL's Adams Street branch, but ended up looking through explicit photographs instead. 
Ms. Sullivan says: `I'm very, very upset because I have no idea what he saw on the screen. He said he was using the Internet to do a book report on Indians and he was able to access dirty pictures, pictures of naked people.' 
When the library spokesman was asked about parent's concerns, he dismissed them saying, `We do have children's librarians but we do not have Internet police.' 
So here is the genuine concern of the American Library Association for children and their genuine support for blocking software as a solution.

Mr. COATS. Mr. Chairman, Senator Levin, I would like to take a few moments to discuss one of the concerns that has been raised relating to the compromise language on depot maintenance. In particular, I would like to ask a few questions regarding the provisions relating to core logistics capabilities and workloads. The concern has been raised that this language could require the Department to change its current depot maintenance practices and bring in-house work that is now performed by contractors. What is the view of the chairman and ranking minority member on this issue?

Mr. COATS. I understand that the Senators from Texas and California believe that the requirement to `ensure'--rather than `promote'--cost efficiency in the depots might be interpreted in such a way as to require the Department to withdraw depot maintenance workloads from the private sector and perform the work in public depots in order to achieve efficiency because the only way they can operate efficiently is to fully utilize the physical capacity. Could you please explain your interpretation of the language? What do you believe it requires?

Mr. COATS. I would say to the Senator that yes, his understanding is correct. The conferees believe it is important that the Department of Defense understands that the intent of Congress was not to prohibit future procurement of basic BAT, but to eliminate 1998 production. Future congressional evaluation will determine whether the Army should enter into either full-scale production of the basic BAT submunition or limit production to the number required for testing and evaluation of the improved (P31) BAT objective system.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding this time. I rise to urge my colleagues to support the vote coming up here on the Defense Authorization Act. I congratulate Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin for their leadership on this issue. We have continued a bipartisan effort in the Senate Armed Services Committee for addressing the key issues facing our national security policy. 
It has been a contentious and difficult process this year, but one, nevertheless, that has gone ahead, and we are here today just a few moments away from voting on this and sending it to the President. 
It is important to note that we have reached support in the Senate Armed Services Committee; all 18 members of the committee have signed the conference report and, most importantly, we have been able to address some of the most difficult issues in a way that I think, while not perfect and while not the solution to everybody's concerns, clearly moves us in the right direction. 
Senator Levin and others have talked about the depot provisions. I appreciate how difficult it has been and the very strong views of Senators on both sides of the aisle on these provisions. 
Earlier, I opposed the depot provisions which were originally recommended by the readiness panel because they explicitly precluded competition for the resolution of the Kelly and McClellan Air Logistics Centers issue. We went back to work --a number of people spent a great deal of time and effort trying to find a way in which we could develop a substantive set of provisions that would promote competition, and I said that if we could do that, I would support it. 
Now, if I were drafting this legislation, I would have gone much further than we have been able to go. I think, clearly, if we can't move further faster on privatization efforts, we are going to continue to face shortfalls in modernization, shortfalls in research and development, and in other vital areas for the military. 
This, I believe, is the best we are able to do at this particular time given the polarization on this issue between members on the Depot Caucus and those who were promoting greater competition. We have been able to move the percentages from 60-40 to 50-50. I know that 50-50 is not defined in the way all of us would like, but it is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, it will open the way for further discussion and determination of what core capacity we need to retain within the services and how we can also move toward privatizing maintenance in a way that saves the Department money. 
It will also, hopefully, open the door to another round of BRAC closings. There should not be any disagreement that we still have too much infrastructure given the size of our force. It is aging infrastructure. It is costly infrastructure. Unless we can find ways to close that infrastructure, and modernize and streamline the way in which we provide for our national defense, we are going to continually face a shortfall of funds, particularly given the fact that we have a fixed top line, as stated in the budget agreement. 
One of the provisions of the depot compromise involves an initiative that was suggested to us by the Business Executives for National Security Tail-to-Tooth Commission, the so-called BENS Commission. It's private partnerships within the public sector. This commission is made up of people from both parties, former Members of the Senate and Cabinet, leaders of industry and retired members of the Joint Chiefs. And their insights, I believe, ought to be given significant attention. 
Let me just quote from one of the sections of the bill which incorporated one of their suggestions. Section 359 of the depot provisions is titled, `Requirement for Use of Competitive Procedures in Contracting for Performance of Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair Workloads Formerly Performed at Closed or Realigned Military Installations.' 
And this provision states, and I quote: 
Any offeror, whether public or private, may offer to perform the workload at any location or locations selected by the offeror and to team with any other public or private entity to perform that workload at one or more locations. 
This provision enables the Department of Defense to leverage the core competencies of our public-sector depots with those of private industry in building the most effective and the most efficient team for maintaining our military's equipment, and it does so in a way that keeps competitive pressures on both the private and the public sector that will ensure that the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer continue to get the best value for their defense dollar. 
The Pentagon has indicated that this is a workable approach to resolving the highly charged issues surrounding Kelly and McClellan Air Logistics Centers. I know there is not agreement on that point, but my analysis of this is that it moves us significantly in the right direction. And given the dynamics of the political considerations that we are facing, it is the best we can do this year. We are not going to get a bill without this. I trust the administration will think long and hard before they consider a veto over this provision. I do not believe we are going to be able to go back and adjust it one way or the other in any significant measure without creating a loss of support on one side or the other, depending on which way we go. 
So I urge the administration to understand the process that we have been through, where we started and where we now are and take this as a significant incremental step in the necessary effort to move toward privatization. 
Mr. President, I would also like to briefly talk about some things that we have done in my role as chairman of the Airland Subcommittee. First, the national Defense authorization supports the Army's Force XXI initiatives which significantly enhances the situational awareness and combat effectiveness of our land forces through information technology. Yet, we need to do much more to get the spectrum of digitization efforts, which were so strongly endorsed by the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, adequately funded. But at least this is a fair start. 
And for the record, I wish to correct a statement reported in press this morning that the first flight of the second Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter would be delayed because of a 2.75 percent tax levied on acquisition programs in the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill, which we are voting on today. I want to emphasize that this Defense Authorization fully funds the Comanche program at the level requested in the President's Budget, and that it does not include a tax. The tax reported in this article was levied in appropriation, not authorization, legislation. 
We have been able to incorporate in this bill a significant enhancement in the military's tactical and operational mobility through increases in tactical trucks, the establishment of multiyear procurement for the family of medium tactical vehicles, and increases in V-22 procurement. We have also added increases for tactical air and missile defense capabilities. 
Specifically, however, I want to talk about the F-22. I 
spoke at length about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and technology risks during our deliberations over Defense appropriations. This national Defense authorization provides the same F-22 funding levels, but goes the very important further step to put key oversight provisions in place that will help Congress and the Administration keep this program on track. 
First, this Defense Authorization includes the Senate's total cost cap provisions which limit the level of engineering and manufacturing development to approximately $18.7 billion and production to $43.3 billion. 
Second, the Defense authorization requires an annual review of the F-22 program by the General Accounting Office. This report will address whether the F-22 EMD program is meeting established goals in performance, cost, and schedule; and whether the F-22 program is consistent with the cost caps we have established. The Comptroller General also must certify to Congress that he has had access to sufficient information to make informed judgments on the matters covered by the reports. This seriesof annual reviews will provide us a visibility into the F-22 program which we have not had to date. And it will also provide a means of independent assessment on the spending and technical performance of the program so that this body can effectively continue its long history of oversight on the key F-22 program. 
In conclusion, this national Defense authorization makes great strides in supporting the defense strategy of shape, respond, and prepare now. It provides significant increases in our readiness accounts by adding over $750 million to address shortfalls in flying hours, real property maintenance, and ammunition procurement. 
It also takes better care of our military servicemembers and their quality of life through a 2.8 percent pay raise and a reformed approach to quarters allowances. 
And it accelerates investment to address shortfalls in key mission capabilities such as adding over $700 million for theater and missile defense programs. 
Finally, this national Defense authorization provides a reasonable compromise to the depot issue through a fair and open competition which serves the best interests of the military and the American taxpayer. 
In short, this bill provides the policy and fiscal provisions representative of the prudent oversight from our Senate authorization process. It provides a framework for setting a course which ensures U.S. military dominance into the 21st Century. 
This National Defense Authorization has my full support, and I urge my colleagues to support us when the vote comes forward in just a few moments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my good friend, Senator Lieberman, in introducing another bill which has as its primary aim the expansion of educational opportunities for children. Senator Lieberman has been a leader in promoting educational alternatives, and his efforts in the charter school movement have contributed to the tremendous growth in the number of charter schools since 1994. I commend him for his work in this area and am honored to join him in introducing the Charter School Expansion Act of 1997. 
This bill builds on the great success of the original charter school legislation which Senator Lieberman introduced in 1994. The Federal Charter School Grant Program provided seed money to charter school operators to help them cover the startup costs of beginning a charter school. In the last 3 years, the number of charter schools in operation around the country has tripled, with more than 700 charter schools now in 23 States. 
The purpose of this bill is to further encourage the growth of high-quality charter schools around the country. 
This bill provides incentives to encourage States to increase the number of charter schools in their State. The bill also tightens the eligibility definitions to better direct funds to those States who are committed to developing strong charter schools. 
To ensure that charter schools have enough funding to continue once their doors are opened, this bill provides that charter schools get their fair share of Federal programs for which they are eligible, such as title 1 and IDEA. 
This bill also increases the financing options available to charter schools and allows them to utilize funds from the title VI block grant program for startup costs. 
And finally, the Secretary of Education and each State education agency is directed to inform every school district about the charter school option so that this educational alternative will be an option for any parent who is interested.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today the White House is sponsoring an all-day conference on child care. I believe the President and First Lady have correctly identified this as an important issue to families, and particularly to working families in America. A number of experts have been invited to testify and to participate in panel discussions throughout the day. 
This is an important but yet also a very complex issue. The complexity of the issue is that there is one segment of our population that seriously needs high-quality day care in order to work--work that for many has been required through welfare reform. Others work out of economic necessity; both mother and father need to be employed. And again for others, who are single parents raising their children, they need to provide the financial wherewithal to do that. The focus on the child care conference at the White House correctly focuses on this segment of our population. 
The conference will focus on three questions: how to increase access for child care; how to make it more affordable; and how to guarantee the quality of child care so that children will be safe. 
But, what the conference did not focus on was another segment of the population, in fact a majority segment of the population, the nearly 50 percent who do not have both parents working and another 25 percent who do not work out of the home full time. One of the questions, unfortunately, that will not be discussed at the White House today is how we can ensure that we are not discouraging or sending the wrong signals to the second segment, those parents, those mothers who stay home and do not work and those parents who keep one parent at home raising the child while the other works or they take separate shifts or they have worked out arrangements to raise their own children. 
There is a legitimate need, I believe, to address the first question, how we provide child care for working families, for single mothers, for welfare mothers and others. But there is also a legitimate and essential question that needs to be discussed along with that, and that is what can we do to help those who have made the decision to stay at home? 
We have recently had some exciting developments concerning infant brain development, about the much earlier than originally thought development, the connection of synapses that occur, the billions of these connections that occur at very, very early ages and how important it is to recognize that and to make sure that children receive the correct upbringing, stimulation and so forth to foster that development. 
Again, unfortunately, there has been little discussion along with that about the critical nature of the emotional development of the infant, because, after all, as many experts have told us, it is the emotional development of the infant that is the fuel that drives the automobile, to use a metaphor. Unfortunately, there has been little discussion about this in the recent child care debate that focuses on those early years and the need for correct and effective childhood development. Recently, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Children and Families, I held a hearing in which we heard testimony from Dr. Diane Fisher, who is a practicing clinical psychologist. I want to quote from her: 
Imagine a brilliant, stimulated, optimally educated child who is lacking in self-esteem, self-control, identity or discipline. This in fact is what we are hearing about in our schools today--privileged, indulged children who are wired to the Internet but without a moral compass or a sense of connection to the adults who are supposed to be present in their lives. 
Our committee heard about how mothers are biologically hard wired to form a close emotional tie with their children; that this bonding experience is not a quick experience, something to be accomplished in a matter of weeks or even months, but something that is a gradual process that proceeds slowly and over time. Anybody who is a parent knows that. We don't need studies or experts to come and testify as to the kind of bonding that takes place between parents and children, particularly mother and child, in those first critical early months and years and then throughout their growing experience for the next 15 or 20 years or so. 
For the last 15 years I have been involved, first, as the ranking Republican on the Early Childhood, Youth and Families Committee in the House of Representatives during my service there and in the last 9 years as chairman or ranking member of the Children and Families Subcommittee here in the Senate. Over that time I have listened to and read and personally visited experts in the field--sociologists, psychologists, child development experts, and so forth--who have impressed upon me the absolutely critical element of the emotional attachment, the emotional connection, the bonding process between mother and child with infants, and mothers and fathers with their children, and how absolutely essential this correct attachment is for successful childhood development. 
Most of this is not accomplished through a complex formula. It is not accomplished through a lot of educational training, academic training, or how-to books. It is accomplished intuitively by a mother motivated by love and enjoyment of that child. It takes an enormous amount of love and motivation to want to pay attention to the subtle cues that an infant or a young child sends on a moment-by-moment, hour-by-hour, daily basis. Frankly, it is very rare to find a caregiver who is either able or motivated by that same degree of love and attention and motivation to pay that kind of attention to a child. Often they have a number of children to look out for, and it is just keeping some semblance of order in the child-care facility that becomes the paramount challenge for the child-care provider. 
We talk a lot about and they are talking today at the White House a lot about the term quality. Often that is used by the experts, or those who are discussing this, as a code word, `quality' meaning we need more control, we need more regulation, we need more oversight of child care facilities. 
The quality of child care, for those children, especially children 0 to 3, is more than just having developmentally appropriate materials or an effective well-located site staffed by trained individuals that is important in child care, although it is only one form of child care, but quality is, I believe, more clearly related, and according to the experts we had testify before our committee, more clearly related to love and nurture and, as such, I believe, we have to recognize that it is a child's mother, a child's father that are in the best position to offer that love and nurture to their children. 
As one mother told me, and this is someone who holds an advanced degree in family therapy, an expert in the field of raising children, she said a baby, a young child, needs to be adored. There isn't a child care provider in the world that can adore my child like I can adore my child. Only a mother can truly adore a child, provide the kind of nurturing that children need when they are growing up. We know that and most American people know this. 
A recent Gallup poll for the Los Angeles Times said 73 percent of the American public believes too many children are being raised in day care and not nearly enough are being raised by their mother at home, and children fare best when raised by their mother at home. That figure was up from 68 percent who responded that way in 1987. 
If we truly believe in quality child care, then I believe we should focus much of our attention, not just on ways in which we can provide improved quality care for children in day care settings, for those mothers who have no choice, for those families that have no choice, for those welfare mothers who have no choice but to move into the workplace, but we should also provide equal attention to those initiatives that can make it easier for families to have at least one parent remain at home, those families that can juggle their work schedules so that the primary care for their child is from parent to child rather than from paid provider to child. 
The White House is going to be issuing a number of initiatives, according to reports, about how we as a society, both the private sector and the public sector, can provide assistance for child care facilities to improve the quality and access to child care. But shouldn't we also be discussing the positive family friendly policies that can provide assistance to those who have the ability or make the choice to stay at home with their children, like extended job protected leave? 
As a Republican conservative, I broke with many of my fellow colleagues on the issue of family leave. I believe it is an important provision to guarantee that mothers have the choice of taking at least 12 weeks after the child is born to be with that child, but beyond that, the initiatives of part-time work, flextime, comptime, job sharing, telecommuting, and other corporate policies which a majority of families would prefer if they had the option, because many parents are willing to work less and provide more care for their own children if it is possible for them to do so and still maintain economic viability. 
According to a 1991 survey sponsored by the Hilton Hotel Corp., two-thirds of Americans said they would take salary reductions in order to get more time off from work. There is another way we can focus Federal attention appropriately on making it easier for families to provide care for children at home: Tax fairness. 
In my time in the Congress, I haven't agreed on too many issues with former Representative Pat Schroeder, but one thing she said that I did identify with and I have always remembered is she said you can get a bigger tax break for breeding racehorses than you can for raising children, and she was right. The Tax Code over the years has penalized parents for spending time with their children by narrowly linking tax benefits to day care expenses and provisions on the other side of the equation. The dependent care tax credit, for example, is constructed in such a way that the more time a child spends in day care and the higher, therefore, the family's day care expenses, the greater the tax benefits. 
Mr. President, I don't want to ignore the reality that growing economic and cultural pressures make it difficult for parents to spend as much time with their children as they would like. We all face that problem. Tying tax benefits to day care expenses makes matters worse, not better. It penalizes parents for caring for their own children by redistributing income by those who make extensive use of out-of-home professional day care services. Tax benefits which favor day care over parental care should be replaced, I suggest, by increasing benefits for all families with young children. 
While I fully expect that the White House Conference on Child Care will emerge with new policy recommendations, such as model standards for quality care or the expansion of the military model of child care in the private sector, I would caution that we need to pay equal attention to the facts that we have learned about the critical importance, especially in early years, about the need of strong attachment between mother, father and child. 
We also must ask the question: Are there policies which we can support and provide leadership on that will, in fact, make that attachment a true priority? Because if we have learned anything over the past couple of decades, it is how critical that attachment between child and family, mother and child, father and child is and the uncomfortable fact that for many, quality child care, though important, can never be an effective substitute for parental attachment. 
I hope, Mr. President, that in this day of focus on provision of child care, we can also focus our attention on what true quality care is and look for ways in which we can initiate and implement policies in the Congress and in the workplace that can provide mothers and families with this very, very important and essential element to successful child raising. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we had, I think, a very constructive debate on the school choice issue, scholarships for D.C. children. Unfortunately, while having obtained a majority vote in support of at least a test of a program to provide some educational opportunities to D.C. children, we were not able to break a procedural vote of 60 necessary to move forward with this legislation. That limited our options considerably. While Senator Lieberman and I were pleased with the fact that we received more votes than we ever have on this issue, we were still two short of the necessary number to break the promised filibuster on this, and that limits our options. 
Mr. President, this is an issue that is not going away. I have always said this is not something that will be legislated from the top down in Congress but will be a grassroots movement from parents and PTA's and administrators and educators and others throughout America who are demanding better education for their children. Unfortunately, in many instances, they are not finding it in some of their public schools. 
This is not a condemnation of the public school system. There are many fine public schools across this country. There are dedicated teachers, dedicated administrators, schools that are providing opportunities for their young people. 
I am a product of the public schools, as is my wife. Our children are products of public schools, and we have found schools that have provided a sound education for our children. 
Unfortunately, there are people in this country who don't have the options that we have had, who don't have the options that those of means have in terms of where they live, the school systems they choose to support, to be a part of and options that, should they find themselves in the situation where they are living that their public schools are not providing the education their children need or a school that has such a high incidence of violence and crime and other problems that they don't feel their children are safe there, they don't have the option that many of us have of transferring their student to a private school or another school outside the system or moving to an area where they can receive the kind of education they want their children to receive. 
There is a very interesting story this morning in the Washington Post: `Popularity Grows for Alternatives to Public School. Some Districts Reacting to Threat of Competition.' 
The whole point we were trying to make yesterday is that we are not trying to undo the public school system. We are trying to provide options and alternatives for parents who are trapped in those public schools. But, by the same token, we hope that the competitive pressure will shake them out of their lethargy and cause them to bring about the changes and reforms necessary to make them viable once again. 
In quoting from the Post, an article by Rene Sanchez, it says: 
In a movement flustering schools across the nation, more parents than ever are choosing alternatives to public education for their children, so much that what once seemed only a fad to many educators is instead starting to resemble a revolution. 
Charter schools are expanding at breakneck pace. Religious schools are overflowing with new students. Home schooling is attracting unprecedented numbers of parents who only a few years ago would never have dreamed of teaching their own children. 
Those migrating from public education say the roots of their disenchantment vary. Some parents are frustrated with bureaucracy, others fear student violence. Some want their children to spend more time learning values, others call the one-size-fits-all model of most large public schools an ineffective and impersonal way to learn. *****  
But today those trends have begun to send a powerful message to public schools, even prompting some of them to acknowledge a threat of competition for the first time. 
Our system is built on competition. We pride ourselves in America as producing the best product at the best price because of competitive pressures that force us to do better, that force us to make better products at lower cost, that force us to respond to someone else who is attempting to accomplish the same goal and might have found a better way to do it. It is that that has made this such a dynamic economy, one that employs so many people gainfully, and one that provides such a quality of living for so many Americans. That is the American way. 
That system works everywhere except where there is a public monopoly, a State-run government public monopoly. That public monopoly has existed in public schools for far too long in far too many places. There are vigorous private school and parochial school options available in many parts of this country, but they are, sadly, lacking in some of the areas where they are needed the most. 
But more than that, the problem is not lack of alternatives. The problem has been a system which leaves the lowest income and frequently the minority students of this country living in our urban areas with only one choice. And that choice, unfortunately, has been a failed public school. They have been denied opportunities to gain skills to enter the workplace. They have been denied opportunities to receive an education that qualifies them to go on to college or university education. They, therefore, are trapped, trapped in a system, a system which says, `We will do anything we can to maintain the status quo, and yet at the same time we will prevent you from an alternative by blocking any attempts to provide scholarships or vouchers or stipends or support to assist you in paying the tuition if you choose to move from a public school.' 
We had that debate yesterday. It was a very instructive debate. I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. It is bipartisan obviously, Democrat and Republican, one from Connecticut, one from Indiana, joining forces. I appreciate the support we had from a few of our Democratic colleagues across the aisle. Unfortunately, we did not get enough to move on with this. 
But there is a revolution going on in public education. It is a healthy one. It is a healthy one because parents are suddenly rising up and saying: We will not accept the platitudes and the promises that come from the public school system when now 15 years after the report `A Nation At Risk', 15 years later, essentially, we see no dramatic changes or no effective changes in many of our public schools. We will not accept any longer the promises of a system which cannot overcome its inertia and its bureaucracy, which cannot direct a majority of its funds to educating students but yet eats up a majority of those funds or a very substantial portion of those funds in administrative costs. 
So this issue will be back. It will be back over and over again, and it will arise not because two Senators chose to offer an amendment to the D.C. appropriations bill; it will arise because constituents of Members throughout the country will demand in town meetings and in letters and in calls to their Congressmen and Senators, will demand opportunities and alternatives. No longer will inner-city poor parents, welfare 
parents and others living at or near the poverty line, allow their children to be condemned to a lifetime of inability to succeed because of the failure of the public school system to provide their children with an education. 
They will demand that their Congressmen and their Senators provide opportunities, that their councilmen and their mayors and their school systems either provide a sound education for their children or give them the opportunity to seek that elsewhere. What parent would not do that? What parent in this Senate body would not do that? We all would because we have that choice. Minority children in many cases do not have that choice. 
Mr. President, I would like to say just one more thing before I yield the floor. There was another quote in the Washington Post this morning in an article covering this particular issue. That quote was a disturbing one. There are boundaries to public discourse. There are boundaries that we all try to live by, boundaries of civility and honesty and good taste. When those limits are violated, it undermines this institution and it makes democracy more difficult. 
I think deep disagreements are possible without bitterness. I have done my best to conduct my debates, including this school choice debate, in that spirit. But today in the Washington Post a quote was attributed to the Senator from Massachusetts. The Post has misquoted me in the past, and I sincerely hope that they have misquoted the Senator from Massachusetts. That quote reads: 
Kennedy reminded Republicans that `D.C. is not a test tube for misguided Republican ideological experiments on education. . ..Republicans in Congress should stop acting like plantation masters and start treating the people of D.C. with the respect they deserve.' 
Mr. President, this is not just a racially offensive, irresponsible charge; it is the total inversion of reality. It is the opponents of school choice who want to require, compel, force minority children to remain in substandard schools. It is the opponents of school choice who want to confine poor minority children within the four walls of failed institutions, and sometimes just the four walls because the roofs are in disrepair. 
Despite the infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars into this system, much of it is wasted irresponsibly in not providing either buildings or education to the children of the District of Columbia. 
If there is a plantation here, it is a paternalistic plantation of those who somehow justify restricting the choices and options of poor children as a defense of their civil rights. As Alveda King said in room 207 just off the Senate floor here a week ago: One of the greatest civil rights issues for minority people today and for African-Americans is those who deny young black children the opportunity to receive an education. That condemns them, because of their income, because of where they live geographically, to a failed public school that fails to educate their children and condemns them to a lifetime of failure. 
Let me suggest how we can respect the people of the District. We can respect them to make good choices in the interests of their children. We can respect them enough to give them options other than coercive assignment to failed and dangerous schools. We can respect them with resources, not with 
more lip service, platitudes, or promises. We can respect the right of a parent, the knowledge of a parent, the caring of a parent to make wise decisions for their children without the paternalistic attitude that only Congress or only bureaucrats, only the State, or only Government knows what is best for our children. This charge that supporters of school choice are plantation masters is deceptive and it is racist and it is hypocritical. 
It is time for all of us, liberals and conservatives, to search our conscience. There are Members of this body who voted against scholarships for African-American children whose families have not darkened the door of public schools for generations. There are Members of the administration and this body, hours after those scholarships were defeated, who attended back-to-school night at Sidwell Friends, a school safe from leaking roofs and commonplace violence and failed education that prevails in so much of the District's public schools. 
Does not anyone see the irony, does not anyone see the hypocrisy, does not anyone see the injustice in all of this? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. I am pleased that over the last few days we have had the opportunity to debate what I think is a very vital and very important issue, particularly one that affects low-income children in the District of Columbia. We have had a number of debates on the Senate floor on the question of vouchers for students to have a choice to attend another school because the parents do not feel the school their child is in is providing the education they need to succeed. 
We have a particularly acute situation in the District of Columbia whereby a number of children find themselves trapped in schools, in particularly low-income, primarily minority neighborhoods, with virtually no way out. We know that many aspire to be pro athletes, and I join that group that aspires to do that, but unfortunately God only gives a very select few the kind of talent to do that. Education is one of the primary ways for young people to better their circumstances, particularly in situations where children of limited means or practically no means find themselves locked in a situation that gives them no choice. Then their opportunities for meaningful and gainful employment in the workplace or for continued education to give them better opportunities is forfeited.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is interesting that in this debate not one person who is opposed to the scholarship program for D.C. students has come down here and addressed the fundamental issue of this debate. The fundamental issue is, will we give poverty-stricken minority children the opportunity to escape a failed educational system so that they, too, can participate in the American dream? 
We have talked about plumbing, air conditioning, crumbling schools, and we have heard if you can't give it for 100, you can't give it for any. What kind of argument is that? In other words, if you can't totally reform the system all at once for everyone, you condemn another whole generation in the District of Columbia--and in Chicago and other cities around this country--to failure and the inability to gain skills to become gainfully employed or to have the opportunity to go on to further education. 
Now, this argument about bleeding the system--if I could have the attention of the Senator from Illinois and the delegate from the District of Columbia, who is on the floor--bleeding the system. The D.C. school system gets $672 million a year, and you are saying that if you added $7 million, the system would be fixed? 
The General Accounting Office said that 25 percent of the maintenance budget never leaves the maintenance facilities office. It doesn't go to fix plumbing. The system is broken. We are taking $7 million, not out of the $672 million, not one penny of this is coming out of the current budget for D.C. schools. The $7 million is coming out of money set aside to reduce the general deficit. That was added on to the President's budget. 
Bleeding the system, fixing the ventilating, while kids can't even achieve the test score to go on to higher education, kids can't get out of a school--your own statistics show why parents want to leave. If 67 percent of the schools have crumbling roofs and 65 percent have faulty plumbing and 66 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and more than 50 percent goes to maintenance and administration and less than 50 percent of the $672 million goes to educating students, what is wrong with that system? There is something desperately wrong with the system. 
This program is designed to at least give 2,000 kids a chance. We talk about the 100-percent solution. Well, it is like if you can't give 100 percent of the kids an opportunity within a failed system, then let's not give any kids an opportunity, let's condemn all of them. 
Now, the District of Columbia system needs help desperately. Even the Washington Post, not a supporter of school vouchers, has said give it a chance. At least try it, to see if maybe it spurs the system on, the D.C. public schools 
system, to a little bit better performance. If it doesn't work--we have a test built in here--if it doesn't work, we will try something else. But let's do something to help these kids. Let's do a small, little piece. 
Now, the Senator from California talks about bureaucracy. `Bureaucracy' is another word for the D.C. public school system. More than 50 percent of the money, $672 million, doesn't even go to the classroom. Yet in this bill we have a cap of 7.5 percent on administration. We will match our administration with the D.C. administration any time, anywhere. 
Senator Kennedy said, who wants it? Nobody wants it in the District of Columbia. Here are 2,000 parents that want it that have signed this petition. I have a list of 100 ministers, D.C. ministers, almost all minority ministers, who said, we plead with you, give our kids a chance to get an education. They want it. 
There was a recent poll taken in the District of Columbia, and 64 percent of D.C. residents indicated if they had the funds, they would get their kids out of the public school system; 40 percent drop out--the Senator had a chart saying 50; say it's 40 or 50 percent, whatever--they don't even graduate from the system. 
The constitutional argument--vouchers are good enough for day care. I think the Senator supported that. Vouchers are good enough for Head Start. I think the Senator supported that. Vouchers are good enough for the GI bill and good enough for kids to go to Loyola in your State. That is a religious school. If they are good enough for people over 17 and they are good enough for kids under 5, why aren't they good enough for kids between 5 and 17? 
Does the Senator want to respond?

Mr. COATS. I will be glad to respond. This Senator would be happy to support any effort to improve public schools, but I don't put plumbing ahead of education. I think the first thing we ought to do--and I don't know why the Senator doesn't support it--we first ought to help kids get educated, and at the same time maybe we can do that. 
If we don't fix the schools, we will not fix the education--that is upside down. 
One last thing. It was stated on this floor that few parents can get to the schoolhouse door. Well, there are a lot of poor kids who have no opportunities in life that can't get through the schoolhouse door because Members of Congress are standing at the schoolhouse door saying, `Nope, you are not allowed in the school. You don't have the money, you can't get in.' 
I am a product of public schools. My kids are a product of public schools. I support public schools. But I don't support public schools that don't give education. I want to do something to help that public education. 
I yield the remaining time existing to the Senator from Connecticut.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to address this question of the defense appropriations bill with some degree of disappointment. 
First of all, I am disappointed that an appropriations bill is going to be passed out of this Congress ahead of the authorization. That is not the way it is supposed to work. It renders much of the work done by the authorization committee this year of no effect in some of the critical areas. I do not blame the Appropriations Committee, however. There are 4 days remaining before the end of the fiscal year. The clock is ticking. Senate Armed Services and the House didn't get the job done in time, and the Appropriations Committee was patient in giving us that time. I regret that we were not able to get our authorization act together. So I am not here to condemn the Appropriations Committee. 
I do, however, want to express my disappointment, sincere disappointment, that as chairman of the Air and Land Subcommittee the actions that we have taken in the Senate Armed Services Committee to address the question of TACAIR and where we are going in the future were forfeited in the negotiations with the House; that the Senate deferred to the House position particularly on the issue of F-22 funding, and I want to discuss that because there are consequences, I believe, to that decision. 
First, a little bit of history. 
Our committee withheld approximately $500 million in development and advanced procurement funds, and I want to state the reasons why we did so. It was not done on a whim. It was not done on a number picked out of the air. It was done as a result of a process of our methodical oversight of the F-22 program that dates 
back at least to the 103d Congress. 
Here are the facts. The F-22 program as we speak today is approximately $2.2 billion over budget for development alone. There is speculation that F-22 production could also run several billion dollars over program estimates. In fact, in just the last 2 years, the Air Force has cut the number of aircraft to be bought in the next 6 years from 128 to only 70, and yet there has been no decrease in program costs to the taxpayer or money freed up for Department of Defense expenditures in other areas. Yet we have not been told by the Air Force or the contractors how the F-22 program got to be in this situation. 
Those of us on the Armed Services Committee felt it was time to definitively put this program on notice, and that is what we attempted to do. 
Now, Mr. President, I say that as a supporter of the F-22. I think it is fair to say our committee is a strong supporter of the F-22. I have visited production facilities and engine facilities for the F-22. It is a leap ahead in technology. It lays the basis for our crucial joint strike fighter program. It will give us air dominance in the future. Had I thought that the actions we had taken in any way jeopardized further development of the F-22, I would not have considered them. 
But to those who have argued that we must fully support the F-22 air dominance fighter because it is the No. 1 procurement priority of the Department of the Air Force without any questions, without any reservations, without any reports, without any event-based decisionmaking, I think those people are missing the point. They are missing the point of the consequences of doing so and the consequences to other systems. 
Let me also say that I, in addition to supporting F-22, I support the importance of air dominance as a joint warfighting capability. But, we have to remember that the F-22 is just one piece of the Department of Defense TACAIR recapitalization strategy. We are acting like it is the whole thing. 
As a matter of fact, the Navy's F/A-18EF is the Navy's No. 1 priority, and the Marine Corps has placed its priority on the joint strike fighter yet to be developed. So we are looking to balance our approach in joint warfighting capability across the full spectrum of military operations. If the F-22 program is not brought under control, it will severely jeopardize a prudent balance in TACAIR recapitalization. 
So the issue before us is not support for the relative priority of the F-22 program. The issue before us is, does that support imply that we should blindly throw billions of dollars at the program without some accountability? The issue is the viability of the F-22 program, and it is exactly because of the high priority of the F-22 that we need to send a powerful message to the Air Force and to the contractors that the Senate is watching, that we are watching the restructuring, and we are watching for schedule slippage, and we are watching for cost overruns. It is time to hold F-22 to a realistic level of accountability. It is time to end the promises of performance and cost control and instead focus on results. We do so because we want to protect the F-22. We want it to be a viable program, and we do not want it to go the way of other programs that have not been held accountable. 
So, therefore, I regret deeply that the Senate yielded to the House, that we were not able to get the authorization approved, that we yielded to the House in the appropriations process and we are simply giving the Air Force and giving the contractor exactly what they asked for without any explanations, without any details, and without any accountability features built in. 
Let me explain a little bit about why the Armed Services Committee's actions on the F-22 are good policy. 
In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, the Senate requested the Department of Defense and the General Accounting Office assess and provide us a report on the degree of concurrency--that is the testing-while-you-are-buying process that goes on sometimes in these programs; you are buying the planes at the same time you are testing them; many of us would argue that you need to test first and make sure that what you are buying is what you think you are buying--and we asked them for this report on risk, also. In April 1995, we received those reports and the Department of Defense report concluded, just a little over 2 years ago, `there is no reason, based upon risk/concurrency considerations to introduce a program stretch at this time.' So we thought, fine, everything is on track. 
At the same time the GAO conclude that the F-22 program involved considerable risk and that there may be adverse consequences from concurrent development and production. Furthermore, they felt the need for the F-22 program `is not urgent,' it quoted, based on the threat and viability of the F-15 program. 
Then we went into 1996. We held hearings. In those hearings surfaced additional concerns about the level of concurrent production and development, projected F-22 weight and specific fuel consumption. We came back in the National Defense Authorization Act for 1996 to, once again, require the Department of Defense to respond to 21 specific questions. And they did respond and indicated, again, that the level of concurrency in the program was acceptable using departmental risk criteria. 
In short, less than 2 years ago, the Senate was being told the program was on track, no problems. Now in 1997, we held hearings and surfaced still yet other concerns about the F-22's transition from this engineering, manufacturing and development phase to production, based on what one witness calls an `event driven program that ensures that key production criteria are met as a prerequisite for production decisions.' That gave us some assurance. Correspondingly, the Senate then included in the 1997 National Defense Authorization bill a requirement that the Department of Defense undertake a cost analysis and report on their events-based decisionmaking criteria. 
We took them at their word. We said fine, give us a report. Within the last year, the Air Force commissioned a Joint Evaluation Team which concluded that the F-22 development program was $2.2 billion over cost, and that much more time would be needed for testing. This was the first time that we had been notified that the F-22 was in trouble, despite numerous years of hearings and reports back from the Air Force. So, based on this information the committee held--I chaired--two additional hearings in 1997, on tactical aviation. And we learned then that the Air Force canceled four preproduction vehicles that it previously indicated were a key to the program going forward. And then it took that money, $700 million, and put it back into development. This action, to infuse hundreds of millions of dollars into development, was taken by the Air Force again without specifying how the program had been changed, identifying cost-control measures, and describing the level of risk that remains. They have not told us how the program got in this shape. They have only told us that they have found the funds to fix it. They found the funds to fix it by canceling four preproduction aircraft, thereby jeopardizing a necessary step testing for most development programs, which they say now is not necessary, and taking that money and pumping it into engineering and manufacturing development. 
They also promised that event-based decisionmaking would keep the F-22 program on track. We asked them to report on this aspect of the program. The Air Force said it would give us a report on it. They did. That report, 6 months late: 18 words. Here is the Air Force report. Specific exit criteria:  
First EMD aircraft first flight complete. 
Complete engine initial flight release. 
Air vehicle interim production readiness review complete. 
What does that tell us? This is the report that it took them 6 months to put together to respond to what we asked for, what we thought was legitimate? 
Furthermore, each of these three events were supposed to have been completed before the fiscal year even started. What kind of confidence does that provide, for a program with nearly $20 billion in development and well over $40 billion in procurement? We are talking about $60 billion here. Consequently, the Senate Armed Services Committee came to the conclusion that, if tactical air modernization is going to be viable in the future from both a technical perspective and the perspective of affordability, that we had to take some action now in the F-22 program to achieve and ensure performance and cost-control goals. Therefore, I recommended to the Senate, and the Senate agreed, that we not permit the infusion of an additional $420 million into F-22 research and development until we understand how this program came to be in this present condition. 
Some people are going to argue that these actions are too severe. But I think it is just the opposite. We believe the actions that we have taken help to ensure the program's success. Remember, this is just the development phase and it is more than $2 billion over budget. It was not that long ago that then Secretary of Defense Cheney canceled the Navy A-12 program because it was $1 billion over cost. Now we have a plane more than $2 billion over cost. 
I have deep concern over whether we can maintain continuing support politically for the F-22 program here in Congress, and with the American people, if we cannot adequately address these cost overruns and explain to the American people that we are taking prudent steps to make sure that this does not continue. The steps that we have taken are not designed to put the program in jeopardy. They are designed to save the program. They are designed to demonstrate that we recognize there are problems and we must hold the contractors accountable. 
We are told the Air Force and the contractors have this agreement. They don't have an agreement. All they have said is that they have agreed to agree; they have agreed to agree that there will not be any more cost overruns, that they will deliver on time. And I pray and hope--and maybe have some confidence--that they can do that. But the agreement has not been negotiated. It is not in print. It does not have signatures on the bottom line. And until it does, I think it is reasonable to withhold some funds so we know that those agreements are going to be guaranteed and performed. 
What is in jeopardy if the F-22 does not get on track? I suggest four very important things. We may end up treating the F-22 like we did the B-2, producing far fewer than we need but only what we can afford, and then we have an inadequate tactical air program for the future. Also, we could lose support for the next aircraft carrier, the CVN-77. In fact, I believe it's the advanced procurement for the smart-buy initiative that was to save taxpayers $600 million on this carrier that was taken by the appropriators to fund the F-22. We may not get that carrier. Third, we may lose the Joint Strike Fighter. We cannot consider throwing more money at three TACAIR programs, given the low levels of procurement for land and sea systems. F-22 cost growth cannot be permitted to eat the lion's share of the funding pie. The Navy is absolutely counting on the Joint Strike Fighter to complement the F/A-18E/F. The Marine Corps has put their entire TACAIR future solely in the hands of the Joint Strike Fighter. If the Joint 
Strike Fighter does not come through on time, then we are going to have to radically rethink whether or not there will even be Marine Corps TACAIR in the future. 
We all know that from a political standpoint there will not be a Joint Strike Fighter if we cannot control the F-22 cost. This places the Navy and the Marine Corps in deep jeopardy. 
Finally, continued F-22 cost growth could rob funds from other key Air Force modernization initiatives, whether they be TACAIR, strategic airlift, or the communications and intelligence programs which the entire joint force will have to rely on for information superiority in the 21st century. 
In short, we need to be confident and ensure ourselves that the F-22 program is under control. We don't know how else to get their attention. I found that the best way is to say: No performance, no money. 
No, Mr. President, we did that some time back. We were confronted with a very similar cost and performance problem with the development of the C-17--a marvelous airplane, but they could not get their act together. So we told the manufacturer you either come in at cost or you are not going to building more planes. As a result, there was a huge banner erected in the production plant, which said, `Build 40 at cost, or no more.' Guess what, they built 40 at cost and now we have a multiyear procurement of 120 C-17's. This is a success story because Congress held the line, and I am disappointed that we have lost that opportunity with this action. 
We should all ask ourselves whether the F-22 program would benefit from a similar policy from this body.

He was in line, and the clock precluded him from getting his statement in. I would be willing to forgo all but about 1 minute of my remarks if we could go forward with this, and we will get to the other Senators as quickly as possible. A lot of people have been waiting all afternoon to speak, but they were not allowed to speak because of the unanimous consent agreement. We had promised them, if they were here right after the votes, they would be first up.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I again inform my colleagues that we will be brief. I am just trying to fill some commitments we made earlier. I will dispense with my ringing, articulate, persuasive rebuttals to the opponents of this amendment that I have ready to go here, to Senator Boxer and Senator Kennedy and others who spoke against the amendment, and save those until Tuesday. Even though I have the attention of my colleagues who are in the Chamber that I might not have on Tuesday, I will have to trust that yielding the time is probably more persuasive in getting support for my amendment than giving those arguments at this particular point. 
So, I will defer that. However, I have made a commitment to the Senator from Kansas. I think he is going to be relatively brief. I yield to him such time as he may consume. Then, if no one else wants to speak on this particular amendment, I will be happy to yield back.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we will now for about the next 5 hours be discussing an issue that I believe is important to every Member of the U.S. Senate and important to this country and important to the future of education. 
The amendment is titled the `District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship' amendment. It is being offered by myself and Senator Lieberman from Connecticut. We will be presenting the case for this amendment to our colleagues who we trust they will be listening carefully to what is said, and I think the important debate that will ensue as a result of our offering this amendment. 
The amendment is fairly basic. It provides opportunity scholarships for children in grades K through 12 for District of Columbia residents whose family incomes are below 185 percent of the poverty level. Scholarships may be used to pay tuition costs at a public or private school in the District of Columbia and in adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia. 
Scholarships are also available under this amendment for tutoring assistance for students who attend public schools within the District. 
We establish a District of Columbia scholarship corporation that will determine how the money is distributed. 
Student eligibility goes to those, as I said, whose family incomes are 185 percent or below of the poverty line. For those at or below the poverty line, these scholarships can total $3,200. For those who are between the poverty line and 185 percent of that, they can receive the lesser of 75 percent of the cost of tuition and monetary funds and transportation to attend an eligible institution of up to $2,400. The tuition scholarship is also available for tutoring in amounts up to $500 for students who stay in D.C. public schools. 
The election process is designed to not discriminate in any way. All eligible applicants will be considered. If there are more applicants than scholarships available selection will be on a random basis. 
The funding in no way takes one penny out of funds available for D.C. public schools. In fact, the $7 million in spending for fiscal year 1998 comes out of the Federal contribution to the District of Columbia that is earmarked for deficit reduction. That total contribution--$30 million more than the President requested--we will deduct $7 million out of that. So no, the District is not denied any funds, schools are not denied any funds. This is taken out of a fund that was added by Congress in addition to the President's budget. 
Mr. President, there is one unavoidable fact at the center of the school choice debate. When education collapses, it is generally not the middle-class children who suffer the most. Their parents, in response to that collapse, have already chosen other private schools, other public schools or moved to the suburbs or away from that particular school, leaving only the low-income, often minority children, in these dysfunctional, often drug- and crime-infested institutions, with little pretense of learning or educational opportunity. 
We have seen this happen in large cities across our country--in Philadelphia, New York, Detroit, and others. We have seen it happen around us. Every day as we meet here in the Capitol, every day surrounding us in the District of Columbia, our Capital City, we see this happening with tragic results.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Gen. Julius Becton has been charged with reforming education in the District. He deserves our support. But by his own estimates, it will take 5 or 10 years to test his approaches. Similar changes have been promised by five new superintendents in the last 15 years. 
I suspect that many District parents are skeptical. I believe they have every right to be. Put yourself for a moment into their shoes. What good does it do a parent who fears for the current safety and future prospects of their 13-year-old child to wait 10 more years for the results of public school reform? By admitting that public school reform in the District will be accomplished in decades, we are saying that the sacrifice of a generation of students is unavoidable. 
But what if that child were our child? What if that child was the child or the grandchild of a Member of this body who was assigned to a school where physical attacks and robberies and drug sales are rampant, where education is failing, where the one opportunity they have to escape the poverty that they are living in, a decent education, is unavailable to them? Would we be content to sit back and let the bureaucrats tell us it will take a decade to reform these schools? Would those of us who have a 10- or 12- or 13-year-old be content for one moment to allow that situation to exist if there was anything we could do about it? 
We are asking poor inner-city children and their parents to tolerate circumstances for years that most middle-class and affluent Americans would not tolerate for a moment. And we expect 
them to be satisfied and gratified with tinkering changes and symbolic votes on funding which have shown no history of results at all--nothing but failure, endlessly repeated, mindlessly accepted. 
This city should be ashamed of its incompetence. And we in Congress should be ashamed of our failure to deliver some hope, some measure of improvement for these children. This is not an issue of whether or not local or State governments have a right to control education. 
We in the Federal Government have the responsibility for this Federal city. We have a responsibility for the conduct of affairs in this city and in particular for the educational system in this city. That educational system has failed. It is time we offered some remedies. 
With this bill we have set out to turn this justified embarrassment and shame into something productive, something immediately helpful, something hopeful, not something 10 years down the line, but something that can be hopeful immediately to children caught in this tragic situation. 
The argument in favor of low-income school choice comes down to a single question which I hope every Member of this body will seriously ponder. Is it just, is it fair, is it compassionate to insist on the coercive assignment of poor children to failed schools? 
It is a question which answers itself. No, it is not just, it is not fair, it is not compassionate, if there are alternatives that work, that can provide hope to these students, that can provide opportunity for these students to escape the failed education system that they currently are forced to comply with, alternatives that teach care and discipline. 
Right now in the District of Columbia these alternatives exist but they are rationed by cost, distributed by wealth. And that is not just, that is not fair, and that is not compassionate. Yet we can do something about it, at least in the District for at least some of the District's children. 
Mr. President, I am entirely confident about two things in this debate, two facts that I think are beyond dispute. First of all, the children of our cities, even from broken homes in desolate neighborhoods, are capable of educational achievement. This should not be necessary to say because it is obvious to so many of us, but it is not obvious to the educational establishment. 
The educational establishment argues exactly the opposite. They claim that schools fail because parents and students are failures themselves, complicating the work of educators with personal problems. I am sure you have heard this excuse that the jobs of teachers are impossible because families and communities refuse to help. 
But, Mr. President, we know this is not true. We know that disadvantaged children are not educational failures by birth or circumstance or destiny. We know this as a matter of hard social science. We know this because of the success of nonpublic schools, primarily Catholic schools, that admit the same pool of urban students. 
The late James Coleman of the University of Chicago found lower dropout rates and higher test scores among disadvantaged Catholic school students than their public school peers. 
William Evans and Robert Schwab, of the University of Maryland, came to similar conclusions, recording disproportionate gains by disadvantaged kids in Catholic schools. Other studies reveal that Catholic schools are more racially integrated than their public counterparts and succeed at about half the cost. 
I want to repeat, studies have indicated that the Catholic schools are more racially integrated than urban public schools and they succeed where public schools fail, at half the cost of public schools. 
These efforts succeed--with the same group of at-risk children--because Catholic education begins with an entirely different premise than the educational establishment: that every student can succeed if properly guided, and that 8 hours a day is a significant, even decisive, intervention in a child's life. This is not skimming. This is not creaming. This is faith and tenacity. 
I pointed to Catholic urban schools because they have done such a remarkable job in our inner cities. There are other non-Catholic but religious schools and private schools that are secular schools that have demonstrated an ability to take the same students from the same areas, at half the cost or less, and do a better job in preparing those students for educational opportunities for the future or for employment opportunities for the future--an astoundingly better job. 
So this argument that what can you do with these kids, `After all, look at the families they are from, look at the disadvantages that they have, there is nothing that we can do except provide some kind of a baby-sitting service during daylight hours,' that is untrue. We have side by side with these failing public schools in our urban areas, side by side, schools that are accomplishing success and not reaping failure, that are taking the same students and providing that success at less than half the cost of our public schools. 
The second fact I am sure about is that low-income, inner city parents support school choice in growing and overwhelming numbers--75 percent in Philadelphia, 95 percent in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee and Cleveland school choice programs, the only ones of their kind, were not started by Republicans. They were started by parents fed up with their schools that their children were compelled to attend. They were sponsored and supported by an emerging element of African American leadership. Councilwoman Fannie Lewis of Cleveland, Annette `Polly' Williams of Milwaukee, Anyam Palmer of Los Angeles, State Representative Glenn Lewis of Ft. Worth, State Representative Dwight Evans of Philadelphia--these are not black Republican conservatives; they are activist Democrats who view school choice as a matter of equity. They are men and women who have come to resent a nanny state in which the nanny has grown surly and arrogant and abusive and unresponsive. 
Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., in this Capitol just 2 weeks ago, referred to school choice as a matter of civil rights. She says:  
In the name of civil rights, some oppose relief for religious parents who want their children to attend a religious school. In the name of helping poor and minority children, opponents of `opportunity scholarships' want to continue business as usual in the Washington schools. . . . U.S. citizenship guarantees all parents an education for their children. This is a true civil right. Yet some children receive a better education than others, due to their parents' abilities to pay for benefits that are often missing in public schools. This inequity is a violation of the civil rights of the parents and children who are so afflicted by lack of income and by the mismanagement endemic to so many of the country's public school systems. 
Ms. King concludes: 
The District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act was designed specifically to alleviate this inequality--to restore parents' and children's civil rights. 
To Alveda King and to many African-Americans today, this is a 
civil right, the opportunity for equality of opportunity in the education of their children. 
In July of this year, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, on which I proudly serve, held a hearing on the school choice issue. It was particularly instructive. One witness was Howard Fuller, former superintendent of Milwaukee public schools--former superintendent of Milwaukee public schools, an outside-the-box thinker on education. He began by asking a fundamental question: What makes a school public? This is the answer he gave: 
What makes a school public is that it functions in the public interest. 
That interest involves high standards, consistently met--not the provision of services by one group or another. The public interest is to ensure that this happens, through whatever mix of public policies which make it happen. 
He goes on to say: 
Although there must continue to be strong support for public education, it is, in the final analysis, not the system that is important; it is the students and their families who must be primary. We must ask the question, what is the best interests of the children, not in the best interests of the system. And in my professional opinion, the interests of poor students are best served if they are truly given choice which permits them to pursue a variety of successful options, public and private. 
Fuller testified that the most basic problem with the current system is a structure of power relationships that leads to inertia: 
If you do not somehow change the existing power relationships, the existing configurations, no matter how deeply you might feel about making change, it is not going to occur, because the dynamics of the system are a curb to the kind of change you want to make. If you leave it intact, and you operate under its current form, we are not going to make the difference that we want to make for all of the children. But this need not be the end of public education. 
I want to repeat that for my colleagues, the former superintendent of the Milwaukee Public School System, who is talking about the need to change the structure of public education so that it truly can begin the real process of reform, this man says that it need not mean the end of the public school system. 
Opponents of this opportunity scholarship program say, `You really want to do away with the public school system.' Not at all. We absolutely need a public school system in this country to begin to touch and educate the millions of children who live in this country, but we need a system that will provide them with equal opportunities for education, and they are not getting that now, particularly in many urban areas, and particularly among our minority children. 
As Howard Fuller says: 
This need not be the end of public education. It is redefining what is a public educational system in 1997--not what it was in 1960, but what it should look like in 1997, 1998, the year 2000--[and beyond]. 
This shift in power and philosophy that Dr. Fuller describes involves a mix of approaches: strengthened public schools, low-income scholarships and charter schools. I am a supporter of all of those things. They are not mutually exclusive. Senator Lieberman and I are not here today to say undo the public system and replace it with choice. We are saying we support a mix of things. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are necessary to one another. 
Dr. Fuller concludes:  
I think you have to have a series of options for parents. I support charter schools. I support site-based management. I support anything that changes the options for parents. But I am here to say that if one of those options is not choice that gives poor parents a way to leave, the kind of pressure that you need internally is simply not going to occur. 
Dr. Fuller, who supports a range of choice for parents, says 
if one of those options is not choice then poor parents have no way to leave the system and apply the kind of pressure that has to be applied internally if any major change is going to occur. 
His points were buttressed by several inner-city parents who telephoned. Listen to Pam Ballard of Cleveland: 
After being in the Cleveland public schools and having a child who attended Cleveland public schools, my daughter was listed a behavior problem. She was listed a `D' or `F' student in all subjects. She did not want to go to school. She had no interest in school. The students would hit her, kick her, mistreat her. 
But Pam Ballard got a scholarship for her child at Hope Central Academy: 
It made a difference. I see that difference every time I watch my daughters at play, studying, reading, learning. . . Please keep the scholarship and tutoring programs alive. It is a beginning, and we all need new beginnings. It has helped keep me and my daughters alive. 
Listen to Barbara Lewis from Indianapolis, who got similar help for her child: 
My son began to struggle in school. He was not getting the attention he needed. At no time did a teacher ever try to set up a parent-teacher conference to see what we could come up with to help my child. I requested extra credit work, and I tried to set up meetings with the teacher, to no avail. I began to lose hope. I felt that my child's gifts were being wasted. 
Then an individual provided Ms. Lewis with a scholarship that the Indiana State Legislature failed to provide: 
The values I was teaching him at home were finally reinforced at school. My son blossomed into an honor roll student, a student council leader, and a football standout. 
School choice is not a new issue. People of financial means have always had this choice of where they would send their children, to what school. They could afford to move where they wanted, and they could afford the tuition for private schools, while lower-income families with the same hopes and dreams for their children and their children's futures are denied the choice, and they should not be. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will listen to these quiet voices rather than the strident voices of the education unions--voices of hyperbole and hypocrisy. The hyperbole comes in the accusation that we are destroying public education in the District with this measure. On the contrary, we are not even touching it. These scholarships are not deducted from District education funds. They represent entirely new money. The only challenge to public education in the District that they provide is the challenge of example--the example of at-risk students succeeding and private and religious schools where they have not succeed in public schools. 
The hypocrisy is equally clear. While education unions oppose school choice, many inner-city public school teachers send their children to schools other than those which they teach. They are, in fact, two to three times more likely than other parents to send their children to private schools. In Milwaukee and Cleveland, for example, more than 50 percent of public school teachers send their own children to private schools. In the District, that figure is 28 percent, still twice the national average. I don't blame them. They are doing what is in the best interests of their own child. But I do blame education unions for actively denying that choice to others. The hypocrisy of the educational unions and the hypocrisy of those who say we must maintain the public school system and not allow opportunities for low-income people when they, themselves, send their children away from the public schools that they teach in so that they can get a better education at a private school. 
We are not talking about sending children to St. Alban's or Sidwell-Friends. We are talking about sending young, fragile kids to schools with a little order, a little sanity, a little discipline, a little individual attention, a little love--schools like St. Thomas More in Anacostia, or the Nanny Hellen Burroughs 
School in Northeast, islands of nurture and learning. 
I visited those schools. Senator Lieberman and I have taken the opportunity to visit those schools. What a remarkable, remarkable difference at a fraction of the cost of the public schools. We cannot even begin to imagine the fears of a mother in the District who is forced to send her child through barbed wire and metal detectors, into a combat zone masquerading as an education institution. If we do not take the side of that mother with immediate, practical help, we will betray her yet again. I, for one, intend to take the side of these parents without hesitation or without apology and without delay. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there has been either a printing error or technical omission in the current pending amendment--the line 22 on page 34 was omitted, as well as line 23. It simply is a section reference describing the language that follows in the section, plus the line `Notwithstanding any other provision of law.' Everything else is as submitted. And it is a technical change to offset a printing error. 
I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified to reflect this change.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 3 minutes to briefly respond to the Senator. I know the Senator from Rhode Island has been waiting patiently. I don't want to take away from his opportunity. We have speakers on our side, too. The Senator from Rhode Island is next in line. 
I want to respond to some comments made by the Senator from Minnesota, to whom I want to return the compliment. The Senator from Minnesota has been passionate in his efforts to reach out to the disadvantaged in this country and address many of their concerns. I know he comes at this issue--even though it is different from where I come in terms of the solution, I think the goals are the same for both of us. I know he comes at it from a different perspective, but with great sincerity, and he matches his sincerity and his rhetoric with his actions. I noted that the Senator came and paid rapt attention to particularly the comments by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. Senator Wellstone and I have discussed this and have exchanged our views. I just appreciate the Senator's commitment to this and his sincerity about that commitment. 
I would like to comment on a couple of things briefly. There have been different figures thrown around here about per pupil spending in the District of Columbia. We have tried mightily to find out the exact figures. Estimates range from $10,000 to $5,000, as the Senator has mentioned. It is probably somewhere in between. One of the sad things about the D.C. Public School System is that they can't tell us. The accounting is so bad in the District of Columbia--whether it is on roads, housing, police salaries, or public schools--they can't tell us how much they spend per pupil. They can't even tell us the number of pupils. We said, `We know how much we give you; tell us the number of pupils you are educating, and we will divide that into how much we give you.' They say, `We don't know exactly. We can't tell you the number of pupils.' That is kind of a sorry comment on the inefficiency and really incompetence of the D.C. Public School System as it currently exists. 
Just two other things, real quickly. I want to make sure my colleagues know that the money--the $7 million for this program --does not take one penny out of the money allocated to the D.C. public schools for education. In fact, it will increase the money per pupil because they will have 2,000 less students to divide the pot of money they get to educate those students. The money comes from an extra appropriation over and above the President's request, and that money is specifically designated for debt reduction and doesn't go to any operating expenses. So Delegate Norton is wrong when she says this comes out of textbooks, teacher salaries, and operating expenses. It doesn't come out of operating expenses; not one penny less will go to D.C. schools. 
Finally, let me just say the Senator seems to imply that if we can't fix it all, we should not fix anything. We acknowledge that there are a lot of things that need to be fixed in the District of Columbia and around this country. Housing is in deplorable shape, roads are in deplorable shape, early childhood education probably could use funds, food stamps and, as he said, fix the buildings, and so forth. Well, we are not able to do everything, but we are able to do something, something that is focused not on fixing roofs, not on collateral problems--and they are problems that need to be addressed--but we are able to funnel funds directly to 
parents and students who can improve their educational opportunities. As important as it is to fix roofs, buildings, infrastructure, and so forth, more important and the highest priority ought to be to provide education to those children so that they then can become part of the solution. 
Maybe this 3 percent will become part of the 100 percent solution, if they can get an education that would allow them to participate in this. If we were talking about public housing, which is in a disastrous state in this country, particularly in this city, and someone came along with an alternative that was tried elsewhere and would really improve the housing situation, and we said, can we test it here to see if it works here and it will improve housing for those 2,000 people? would you say, no, if we can't do the whole thing, we are not going to do it for anybody? 
All we are asking for is a test that will help 2,000 kids get a better education, but will prove, right or wrong, whether or not school choice is a viable opportunity and viable program to do two things: First, give kids a chance and, second, put pressure on the public school system to reform and change. They have had decades to do this. We keep talking about these alternate solutions, but it doesn't happen. In the meantime, generations of children are being condemned to an inadequate education. 
Mr. President, how much time is available on each side?

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I have been listening carefully to the words of the Senator from Massachusetts. I have clearly come to the conclusion the only remaining problem with the entire 215-page bill is section 404. We have had considerable debate about that yesterday and today. The Senator said this is the last remaining piece. The Senator correctly pointed out, of the 20 items that he was interested in, 19 have been resolved. That is an awfully good batting average, 19 out of 20. Yet the Senator says the bill cannot go forward until the last one is resolved. 
We had a debate on this. The Senator passionately presented his case, but it was not persuasive. Mr. President, 65 Members of the Senate did not agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. We had the vote. That issue has been dispensed with. I know the Senator is upset that his view did not prevail, but it did not prevail, despite lengthy and passionate argument to the contrary. 
But, putting that aside, I hope we can take the Senator at his word, that this is the only part of the bill that remains of concern to him. I have word the FDA lobbyists are currently trying to work the House to undo the negotiations, some of the negotiations on some of those 19 items. I trust the Senator, having acknowledged that those have been negotiated fairly and addressed, would support us in maintaining the language that is in the Senate bill when this bill goes to conference, and not encourage any kind of modification of that or weakening down of that agreed-upon compromise. 
I assume that means section 406 is satisfactory and there is nothing more we need to do with it, based on the Senator's remarks. I am pleased we can go forward on that basis. 
I also heard the Senator say that basically everything is fine at FDA, that this revolution that has taken place under Dr. Kessler solved the problem, admitting there were problems before but we really don't need to do anything more. To quote him, he said, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' FDA is improving as we speak. Everything is going fine at FDA. 
The reason why we are here is that everything is not going fine at FDA. It has not for 20 years. We have been attempting to reform the process at FDA for the past 20 years and there are some reasons for that. It is not fine because there clearly have been 
delays that have resulted in impaired health and safety of Americans. 
You know, there are two edges to this sword. There are two sides to this issue. One side is making sure that we have a Food and Drug Administration that follows careful procedures before approving drugs and devices, because clearly that is in the best interests of the health and safety of Americans. There is no one on this floor, as Senator Dodd said yesterday, who does not want to maintain a vital FDA, with the authority to review drugs and to review devices and to make sure, to the best of their ability, that those drugs and devices promote the health and promote the safety of Americans. 
They will not always be perfect, as we have learned in this discussion. They make mistakes. Sometimes politicians lean on them to approve things that should not be approved and they approve them only to find out later that they should not have approved them. Maybe they should not be subject to that political pressure. They should not. None of us, whether we are for or against a particular drug or device, should be involved in the scientific process of approving or not approving a drug. But we can involve ourselves in requiring that the FDA do what is necessary to avoid the bureaucratic delays, avoid the inefficiencies, and make itself a more efficient administration. I will talk about that in just a moment. 
But let me talk about the other side of this issue. Let me talk about the patients and the consumers, the Americans whose health and safety and whose lives have been jeopardized or lost because of inefficient FDA bureaucratic delays. We talk about those who have been impacted by drugs that have been approved, in some people's view, too quickly. What about those whose health and safety has been impaired and who have died because the drugs have not been approved quickly enough? A very prestigious institution, the Hudson Institution, has done a seminal study on that issue and put out a report in November of 1995 titled, `The Human Cost of Regulation. The Case of Medical Devices and the FDA.' 
I hope my colleagues will read this to understand the other side of the issue, the rest of the story. I will just quote briefly from it. 
When policymakers weigh the costs and benefits of our current policies governing the production of new medical technologies, persons who die from the absence of a device that should have been available should count as much as the victims of a defective device. 
We have heard a lot here about victims of defective devices, but we have not heard very much about victims of devices that have been unnecessarily delayed that could have saved patients' lives, that could have improved their safety.

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. November 1995. I will quote further: 
Although these improvements are certainly laudable, they are not worth the human costs of the FDA's approval system. Rather than protecting public safety, in some cases the FDA's system for approving medical devices actually endangers lives. 
Let me cite some examples: Coronary stents. Coronary stents are simply a wire mesh tube that holds the artery open to facilitate the flow of blood to the heart muscle. During angioplasty, which nearly 400,000 Americans a year undergo, before the coronary stent was developed 15 percent of patients undergoing that operation had a blood vessel collapse and had to go into emergency bypass surgery, which placed them at greater risk, and a lot of lives were lost. The coronary stent, however, became an alternative method of treatment for most of these patients and reduced dramatically the amount of collapsed blood vessels and dramatically the lives that were lost. 
You would think that, given the importance of this technological breakthrough, the FDA would have given expeditious handling to the application for approval of the stent. Sadly, for thousands of Americans who died when they could have benefited from this stent, this was not the case. It took 9 months for the device's developers to obtain permission from the FDA to even begin preliminary phase I clinical trials. These trials took another year. Then the manufacturer conducted phase II trials for 9 months, and based on those results requested immediate permission to begin the final phase III trials. 
The FDA rejected this request. The manufacturer appealed and then again requested permission to begin phase III trials. Three more months and the FDA came back and said no, you can't start. In the meantime, the manufacturer had repeated a whole series of phase II trials again. Finally, 7 months later, the manufacturer completed the first segment of phase III after the FDA finally granted permission, and on and on it went for another 15 months. 
Four months later the FDA's advisory panel of medical experts said OK, we will issue the order granting approval--excuse me. They recommended the order to grant approval. It then took the FDA 12 months to comply with their medical experts' request to order the approval of the stent. 
The Hudson Institute estimated the number of lives lost, and it is an estimate. But, based on a very thorough study, and it is all documented here in this report, they estimated that the lag time attributable to the FDA cost Americans 2,888 lives. That is the other side of the story. 
We hear about mistakes, and, yes, mistakes are made. We are all humans after all. We hear about mistakes, and the Senator from Massachusetts has detailed and had his charts up about individual patients who have been injured, or had their health jeopardized through FDA approval of a product and then the fact that product was not everything that it was billed to be. But we have not heard anything said about the 2,888 patients who died because of FDA bureaucracy and inefficiency in approving a lifesaving medical device. 
Let's assume that only 25 percent of that delay was due to FDA. We are still talking about 1,570 lives. That is the other side of the story. 
I could go on and on. The omnicarbon heart valve, the left ventricular assist device, the heart transplant procedures, all of these, just dealing with the heart--delays because of FDA inefficiency. 
That is why the committee has been so insistent on moving forward with reform. That is why the committee has said, no, everything is not fine at FDA. Yes, we appreciate the fact that they are doing a little bit better since they taxed the pharmaceutical industry to provide the funds to hire the researchers to expedite the approval of drugs. But they have not done better with devices. 
The statements that the Senator has made were wrong. We have not had improvement in the way that devices are handled. High-risk and novel device review times in 1995 increased from 348 days to 773 days; if you count the days in FDA hands, 247 to 606. That is on average. 
I could go over example after example. In fact, in the budget this year, in responding to that, FDA said we are actually going to slow down, we are actually going to have to slow down review times with respect to device submissions. The agency itself predicted that they would complete 6 percent fewer reviews but review them 20 percent slower. Part of that is our fault. We are not giving them the resources that they need to speed up the process. 
But there is another part of this story that we have not heard from the Senator from Massachusetts. That is the testimony of the then-Commissioner of FDA, Dr. David Kessler. The Senator this morning said that under the revolution that is taking place under the leadership of Dr. Kessler, everything now is just hunky-dory. 
Well, we had Dr. Kessler before our committee. Dr. Kessler did not say everything was hunky-dory. Dr. Kessler did not say everything was fine. In fact, Dr. Kessler pretty much threw up his hands and said, `I can't control the agency. I can't administer this agency.' In an astounding statement to Members of Congress, he said, `It's only under pressure from the Congress that we have been able to expedite and move things here.' He said, `I'm at a loss to do this, but you keep the pressure on.' 
Well, if we listen to the Senator from Massachusetts, we would take the pressure off. Then they probably would revert to the same old ways. It is a bureaucracy that has not been administered well under the previous Commissioner. Let us hope the current acting Commissioner or the new Commissioner can do a lot better job than the previous Commissioner. The previous Commissioner seemed more intent on pursuing a political agenda than he did in approving drugs and approving devices that save the lives and improve the health of Americans. 
To respond to a question from a Member of Congress, to make the statement that, `The only way we can improve is if you put pressure on us,' probably explains the sudden rash of approvals that have come out of FDA. Why? Because we have a reform bill in the process. They have gotten the message. They have gotten the message that Congress will no longer tolerate this delay. 
They heard it not just from Republicans, not just from people who so-called represent the device industry or the pharmaceutical industry or the business side, they have heard it from Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, people on both sides of the aisle. 
How did we possibly get out of that Committee on Labor and Human Resources, probably as divided philosophically as any committee in the U.S. Senate, how did we possibly get 14 out of 18 votes? We got it because liberals, Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, all came to the same conclusion. The conclusion 
was: FDA needs reform, and it needs it now. 
We have delayed several weeks here, and even months here, simply trying to get this thing through the Congress. We have had two filibusters. We have had untold procedural tricks and gimmicks, all perfectly within the rules but designed to delay the process. We have had one objection after another. 
It was not that long ago when the Senator from Massachusetts was down on the floor saying, `If we can just fix this cosmetic'--he had his pictures up with problems with the cosmetic and food industry. `That doesn't go to the heart of the problem; the FDA's drugs and devices, that part is fine. That part is settled. We just have to fix the cosmetic part.' And so we said, `OK. We'll fix it.' And Senator Gregg negotiated a compromise with the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senators from California, and others, and we eliminated that concern. 
All of a sudden, when we were told that that is all we needed to do to move this forward, all of a sudden a new issue comes popping up, not one that was offered by amendment in the committee. If it was the primary, the No. 1 priority of the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, you would have thought the Senator from Massachusetts or someone would have offered an amendment in committee. But no, it was then the next thing to delay the bill, the next cause celeb, the next throw down the gauntlet, the next draw down the line in the sand, the next `we can't move forward,' the next `this bill is totally worthless without a fix here.' Fix 19 out of 20. Actually it was 34. The Senator miscounted. Since markup--14-4--since markup, 30 sections of this 60-section bill have been altered. And 34 provisions--as I hold this here in my hand--of negotiations trying to get the Senator to allow us to move forward with this bill. 
The Wall Street Journal today in an op-ed piece calls this a timid bill. It has been watered down. It has been watered down substantially. A lot of us would have liked to have gone a lot farther than we have been able to go with this bill. We had provisions which would allow outside help for the agency, third-party accreditation. Only over the strenuous objections and resistance of the Senator from Massachusetts were we able to move forward with that. 
Yet, the FDA had its own pilot program going on that. This is the medical device equivalent of the PDUFA, of the user fee. Let us get some outside help from accredited agencies that FDA certifies, not that Dan Coats selects, not that some device company selects, but that FDA selects. We gave FDA the authority to go out and find scientific laboratories and testing laboratories that met their standards and, under their standards, would be able to assist them in the process of speeding up the review time of devices. Then we built in all kinds of--all kinds of--FDA authority to select the companies, to make sure that there was no conflict of interest, to oversee the process, to withdraw it at any time, to have a final veto over the approved product. Those are just some of them. I have five pages in this bill here of accredited party participation, restrictions that go to FDA to make sure that process is valid, to make sure it has integrity, to make sure it is not a loophole. 
Here we are trying to do something that helps FDA, that helps speed the approval of devices that can save lives and improve health. We give FDA all kinds of authority, and we 
still have to negotiate as if this was going to destroy FDA. Every latest thing we saw, and then something else comes up. `This is going to destroy FDA.' FDA retains plenty of authority here, but it gets some help in the reform business and gets a strong message from Congress to `get your act together, get a Commissioner that knows how to administer as well as how to politic.' 
I am more exercised than I usually get on this legislation. We have all tried to be patient as we have worked through this process. But more than one person on this Senate floor can get indignant and upset when people's safety and health and lives are in jeopardy. And there is more than one way that people's safety, health and lives are in jeopardy. Delay of this bill, obfuscation, resistance also jeopardize people's health and safety and lives. To suggest that those of us who do not agree that the Senator's 20th item that he wants compliance with is something that is going to destroy FDA, undermine the entire device section of FDA, put Americans at risk of their health and safety and maybe even their lives, I do not think that is a responsible charge. 
I think the obvious answer to that is, delay puts just as many, if not more, people at risk. The Hudson study certainly points that out. What does that mean? It does not mean that we should have no FDA reform. It does not mean we should necessarily have the FDA reform I think we should have. But it means we should have FDA reform. It means we ought to move forward without an ill-conceived attempt to destroy the whole bill. 
I do not think the opposition here has been designed to make this a better bill. I think the opposition--and I think it has been made clear with the Senator's statement this morning that everything is fine at FDA, hunky-dory, it is not broke, it does not need to be fixed, it is improving as we speak, with revolutionary changes under Dr. Kessler. I do not think anybody believes that. Well, maybe two people. We had a vote yesterday 98 to 2. Sixty-five people voted for the so-called provision that the Senator said would absolutely kill the bill. And then 33 more joined with those 65 in voting for the bill, even though the Senator's point did not prevail. 
So 98 to 2 is a pretty good indication that there is a solid belief here for reform and the solid need for reform. I just hope now we do not have to go through this same tortuous delay process in the House of Representatives where the hard work that has been accomplished here is undermined by those foes of any change in FDA, the status quo people. `Everything's fine. Let us just keep it as it is. Let's just keep denying Americans the health and safety improvements. Let's keep denying them an efficient FDA.' 
Anybody who can stand up and defend efficiency and the effectiveness of this Government-run monopoly has not had very much experience with the private sector. All we are trying to do here is--not strip FDA's authority; there is a public function for that. We are trying to give them some help in accomplishing what I think, what 98 of us at least believes needs to be accomplished. 
I am glad I do not have to vent my spleen any more than I already have on this because we are nearing final disposition of this in the Senate. It goes to the House. We will have a contentious conference. I think those who do not want FDA reform will continue to resist this. As I said yesterday, the clock is ticking. If we want funds to provide for the expedited review of drugs, we have to complete this very shortly. September 30 is the date on which it runs out. 
We are not going to go forward with PDUFA funds, appropriations or reauthorization unless it includes the reforms that are in this bill. I think that has been made clear. And I think 98 people made that clear yesterday.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oregon is waiting to bring forward an amendment and I will not take but just a few minutes. We have sent the amendment to the desk as the pending business. It will be debated tomorrow. Senator Lieberman and I are joining as cosponsors in offering this amendment. I have a number of Senators, I think on both sides of the aisle, that wish to speak to it. There will be ample time for them to speak tomorrow on the amendments. They do not need to be concerned about rushing over here now. We did, however, want to have the amendment introduced so it is the pending business when we begin tomorrow. 
In brief summary, the amendment provides opportunity scholarships for children in the District of Columbia in grades K through 12 whose family income is 185 percent or below the poverty level. The scholarships can be used for tuition costs of public or private scholarships in the District of Columbia, and adjacent counties in Virginia and Maryland. Scholarships are available for tutoring of students who attend public schools in the District. 
The legislation creates a District of Columbia Scholarship Commission, a seven-member private, nonprofit corporation, to administer the scholarship program and certify institutions that will be eligible to participate in the scholarship program. One board member will be appointed by the mayor of Washington, DC, and the remaining six are to be appointed by the President, three from the list of nominees provided by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and three by a list of nominees provided by the majority leader of the Senate, both in consultation with the minority. Members must be residents of the District of Columbia and may not be Federal Government employees. 
Students whose family incomes are below the poverty line may receive a scholarship of up to $3,200. Students whose family incomes are above the poverty line but below 185 percent of that level may receive the lesser of 75 percent of the cost of tuition, and mandatory fees for and transportation to attend an eligible institution, or $2,400. Students receiving tutoring assistance are eligible for up to $500. Both of these figures are indexed for inflation. 
If there are not sufficient funds available for all of the eligible applicants, scholarships are to be awarded on a random basis by a lottery selection. The lottery is required to the extent practical to award an equal number of tuition scholarships and scholarships for fees. 
In other words, there will be no skimming of the green, there will be no biasing of the selection. If there are more scholarships than students, then, of course, every student would receive a scholarship that requested one. It is on a voluntary basis. If there are more students than scholarships, they will be awarded on a random basis. The amendment authorizes $7 million for spending in fiscal 1998 out of the Federal contribution earmarked to repay the cumulative Federal fund deficit for the District of Columbia. This total is $30 million. This $7 million earmark would leave $23 million remaining for that specific purpose of deficit fund reduction. 
I point out that that is above the amount recommended by the administration. The administration requested a total Federal contribution for the District of Columbia of $160 million, and the bill before us, the D.C. Appropriations bill, contains $190 million. 
In summary, then, we are not taking a dollar or a penny away from the D.C. public schools. We are not taking any money away from the current operating requirements of the District of Columbia that we are funding. In fact, we are adding $30 million for the purpose of reducing the general fund deficit. Of that additional $30 million, we are earmarking $7 million for these opportunity scholarships. 
In the interest of time, I will not continue here. I will have much more to say about this tomorrow. I am looking forward to offering this amendment, together with my counterpart, Senator Lieberman. This is a bipartisan effort. We are hopeful that we can begin the process of providing alternatives to students and their parents, who do not feel they are getting an adequate education. Our goal is not to undermine the school system of the District of Columbia; it is to improve it. Our goal is to move from the status quo, which is failing many, many students. We think this is an opportunity to do that. We look forward to debating this issue. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am going to repeat points that have already been made, because I think it is essential to the understanding of what we are about here just before we are ready to vote. 
Section 404, the section under debate, preserves a very key premarket statutory authority to the agency. It is important for Members to understand that the agency can call, still call for a premarket action requiring full data on the safety and effectiveness whenever there is a technological difference arising, 
and I quote from the statute, `that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness in the earlier approved device.' 
This authority is premarket. In other words, the product is never cleared for marketing. It is never distributed before the agency has an opportunity to act. 
The authority is extremely broad. As soon as a product raises a question about safety and effectiveness, the agency can require the filing of a premarket authority, PMA. The agency retains full discretion to control the showing of safety and effectiveness. There are no words of limitation on that statutory authority. I point out that that authority has never been challenged successfully by a company in court. 
It was Senator Kennedy's own committee, as chairman of the committee, his own committee report on safe medical devices in the 1990 Device Act that confirmed the breadth of this authority, and I quote from that report. 
However, notwithstanding data that may demonstrate comparable performance, the agency will not find the device substantially equivalent to a predicate device where the newer device raises different safety and effectiveness considerations than the predicate device. Under these circumstances, a finding of not substantially equivalent is made, necessitating a class 3 designation and the requirement of an approved PMA before the new device is marketed. 
This is the language that was--

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 2 minutes we will be voting on the FDA reform bill. 
This committee substitute has been legislated for a 2 1/2 year period thoroughly and carefully and responsibly. It is a piece of work that has received a 14-to-4 vote in committee by Democrats and Republicans. People of different philosophical backgrounds have supported it. It is legislation that has survived two filibusters, and the cloture votes have been overwhelming to move forward. It is legislation that has been changed and modified 34 times to meet the objections of the Senator from Massachusetts and some others about its deficiencies; 34 modifications since that 14-to-4 committee vote. 
There are 8 days left in this month before PDUFA--the tax on the drug companies that funds up to 600 employees at FDA to review and to expedite the review of drugs--8 days left before that authorization expires. The clock is ticking. FDA will be laying off more than 600 people in just 8 days unless we can move this legislation forward. We don't need more filibusters. We don't need more debate. It is time to move forward. If we do not, drug and device reviews will be delayed substantially, and reform will be stopped. Responsible people have legislated responsibly, and I urge my colleagues to support us on this vote coming up.

Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
I want to commend the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for his statement. Much of what I was going to say he has articulated probably better than I could articulate, in terms of the purpose of the 510(k) approval process, the nature of the tests that are involved in approving the devices that are substantially equivalent, and the technicalities that are involved in this that I know not a lot of Members have had the opportunity to focus on or really even the necessity of focusing on. 
The point the Senator makes about the fact that the work of the committee over 2 1/2 years has been careful and thoroughly undertaken in a way that is designed to provide the very best of protection for the consumer, the very best of safety and effectiveness so that the drugs and devices that are approved by FDA are devices and drugs that we can have confidence in. 
No one on the committee is attempting to undermine the essential function and the essential purpose of the Food and Drug Administration. We want a dynamic, vibrant, effective agency in this country that tests the safety and effectiveness of devices and drugs before they are brought to the market. 
Now, no process is ever going to be perfect. There will be mistakes. 
But we want to ensure that this agency has the very best of what it needs to accomplish that essential purpose. What we don't want, and what we are attempting to do with this reform bill is to have a situation continue where the approval process cannot even begin to meet the requirements that the agency thinks are appropriate and that we have dictated by law, by statute. 
Numerous examples have been cited here on the floor, whether it is for drugs, or devices, or even other products that the FDA reviews, of unconscionable delays, of unnecessary delays, of letters being lost, of material that has been misplaced, of the inability of FDA to have the personnel, the manpower, the computer power, the administrative procedures in place that provides for effective, efficient approval. It is all of this that has led to a number of suggested reforms of FDA. And one, which has been working very successfully is the PDUFA, Prescription Drug User Fee Act, where the drug companies themselves put money into a fund that allows the FDA to hire individuals and to purchase equipment and speed up the approval of life-saving and health-improving drugs to the market. That has worked. We want that to continue. We are up against a deadline on that. Funding for that runs out on September 30, the end of the fiscal year. We have been pressing hard now for several months--in fact, all year--to try to move this process forward so we don't run up against this deadline. Yet, we have encountered delay after delay after delay because of disputes about very small portions of a 200-plus page bill, carefully undertaken by the committee over a 2 1/2 year period. 
This is not a partisan issue, as Members who have been engaged in this understand. The Senator from Connecticut; the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone; the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin; the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, have joined with the majority, Senator Jeffords and others on the committee, to produce a very, very substantial majority in support of the original bill, a 14 to 4 margin. Since then, some of the concerns of those four have been addressed in ways that the vote margin and support for the bill has even increased. There were 30-some concessions, which I held up a list of on the floor last week--more than 30 such negotiations and concessions with those who had continuing concerns about the bill. 
So it is not a matter of saying: we won, 14 to 4, and this is the bill, take it or leave it. We are open to producing the very best bill that we can, and we think we have. We have been open to negotiation. But every time we have met an objection, something new pops up. It is ironic that in the committee the amendment we have been talking about here, the amendment that Senator Kennedy has been debating at length, the reason for the filibuster that has gone on, is over language that wasn't even brought up in committee. If this was such an important, egregious omission on the part of the committee, how come an amendment wasn't offered in the committee to debate it or to discuss it or to change it? 
The language that we are talking about here was proposed by Senator Wellstone--hardly someone who is viewed as being anticonsumer or someone viewed as trying to open a loophole so that the health and safety of Americans is jeopardized. In the negotiations and discussions, postcommittee markup, this wasn't on the list. I have in my hand the memo from the Labor Committee, from David Nexon, suggesting items that need to be covered and need to be discussed. This isn't even on the list. We went over these amendments. All of a sudden, when at one point, the only thing left, to our knowledge, was a resolution of the cosmetic portion of the bill, which was resolved, all of a sudden this then pops up. So you have to question what is going on here. 
We have a bipartisan coalition, people from liberal, conservative, and in-between perspectives, politically--Democrats, Republicans, people who worked on the committee, delved into the issues and worked to ensure that we have the very best bill possible. Yet, we meet delay after delay after delay and obstruction after obstruction after obstruction. So I think it is important not just to look at the specifics of the amendment, but to ask the question: What else is going on? What is the true intent here? Is it to undo FDA reform? Is it to block any reform? Here we are up against this deadline for PDUFA, and I think it is important that Members keep all that in mind. 
I was going to go through the technicalities of the 510(k) process, but Senator Dodd did a marvelous job explaining it. As he said, it's the lower risk devices. We are attempting to find a way in which we can efficiently expedite the approval of devices that are designed for the same purpose, which, in the FDA language, are substantially equivalent, and give those devices the opportunity to come to market without having to go through the same lengthy, costly approval process that the original device--the device called the predicate device--is subject to. Sometimes that takes months; often it takes years for that original device to accomplish a specific purpose to be approved. Once that is approved, there are others that can market and make devices that are roughly equivalent--not 
roughly, substantially equivalent to that. If the FDA determines that it is substantially equivalent under their review procedures, then that device can be approved. 
As Senator Dodd has said, however, that is only one part of the test. The other part of the test is that if there is a technological difference that raises safety and effectiveness concerns, FDA can say, `not substantially equivalent.' You have to go through the process. FDA retains that authority. Nothing in this bill changes that authority. Nothing in this bill alters one iota of that authority. Every example raised by the Senator from Massachusetts ignored totally and failed to acknowledge that the second part of the test gives FDA the authority that they said FDA doesn't have. 
So that's what is at issue here. It is an issue that doesn't have to be here. It is an issue that we don't need to be talking about. No one raised it in committee. No one raised it in negotiations postcommittee. No one indicated that this was a bill stopper. The last indication of a bill stopper was the cosmetic concern, which was negotiated and an acceptable compromise was reached. Then, all of a sudden, this provision, 404(b), the language offered by the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and accepted by the committee as part of the bill, without objection, all of a sudden this now becomes the bill stopper, the killer language, the language that is going to destroy the FDA and place 260 million Americans in jeopardy of their life and their health. 
I think Senator Dodd very effectively outlined why the examples used were not relevant examples. They are tragic examples. We all regret that they happened. But they have nothing to do with the language that we are talking about. They have nothing to do with the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island. And so let's keep that in mind as we move forward here in this torturous process of getting a bill passed through the Senate that has been substantially delayed because of procedural practices, which enjoy no support from this body. We have had two votes. I think the opponents of the legislation got five votes on the first try and four votes on the second try. The other 95 of us, or 96, depending on how you count it, are still here attempting to move forward. 
Now, we have the good fortune of having Dr. Frist--Dr./Senator Frist--on our committee. For those of us who don't have the medical training and expertise to fully understand all of this, we frequently--in fact, every opportunity we have on medical questions--turn to Dr. Frist for the expert's view. I think it is a phenomenal addition to the Senate that we have this capability available to us. He will be commenting on this and, frankly, I put a great deal of reliance on his judgment. Some of us could be reading this the wrong way, could be not understanding certain aspects of the process. We represent companies that make these devices. We hear their side of the story and it certainly sounds reasonable, and we try to make sure there is a proper balance between the need to bring products to market quickly and a need to make sure they are safe and effective. So we turn to people like Dr. Frist to give us the expert view in terms of what we are doing. 
I know I have used my time here. I will have more to say about that, as I think we have considerable time left under the cloture procedures here. 
At this point, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, again I want to tell Members I think it is important to keep their eye on the goal here and on the facts. Senator Dodd went through part of the chronology of the approval of the device that Senator Kennedy was talking about. 
I say to my colleagues, the system is working the way it is supposed to work. FDA has the authority. The company submitted the application, FDA cleared the device, then questions came up 
about it, and the FDA responded and asked for some additional material, and then they acknowledge that, yes, we had the material, you sent it to us, but we didn't get a chance to review it. We have now reviewed it.

Mr. COATS. I will be happy to in a moment. 
They made a change in the `indication' and `contraindication' in accordance with what FDA asked them to do. They resubmitted for a new 510(k). FDA, with the help, apparently of Senator Kennedy and his staff, approved the 510(k) and then the new 510(k) was applicable. 
So that is exactly how FDA is supposed to work and it did work under the existing procedures. 
Again, over and over and over, what has not been described and discussed is the authority that the FDA has regarding changes in technology that raised questions of safety and efficacy, effectiveness of the predicate device.

Mr. COATS. I think the Senator from Massachusetts knows exactly what it is we are attempting to do and why we are doing it. It is part of the two-part test. The second part, which the Senator admits on every example he uses and every example he uses does not apply to the situation as it exists. Dalkon shield has nothing to do with this; fen/phen, as the Senator knows, has nothing to do with this language. This whole thing was supposedly prompted by the fen/phen scare, and the Senator failed to admit that fen/phen is a drug and not a device. 
Most of us are trying to keep some level of patience and some level of perspective on this whole process and procedure. I don't know of anybody at U.S. Surgical--they may have visited my staff. I have never talked to anybody that I know of from U.S. Surgical. I didn't even know they made that device. All I know is when they got in trouble they went to Senator Kennedy, and the very device he is talking about that is so dangerous to women's health, he intervened, or at least participated in the process of clearing U.S. Surgical.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't intend at this particular point to get in a specific discussion over section 404. I just urge--clearly, there is a differing point of view. We heard from Senator Dodd from Connecticut, who was involved in the drafting of the bill; and Senator Jeffords from Vermont, the committee chairman, explained this. This was someone who was directly involved in the 404 question and has been drafting the language and negotiating the language. This is clearly an issue we are going to have to address. The committee debated it. There has been negotiation subsequent to that. We are now in a position where we are going to have to agree to disagree. I just urge the Senator from Massachusetts, at the earliest possible time--I know it can't be done today given the problems we have with scheduling the Interior appropriations bill--to bring the amendment to the floor and then let us have the debate and then let the Senate work its will by vote and then go forward. Hopefully, this is not something that is going to further delay passage and then implementation of FDA reform. 
Every day we delay, many things happen, most of them bad. No. 1, we move ever closer to September 30, at which time the PDUFA, the drug prescription user fee which is used to provide the individuals with the resources necessary to expedite drug approval, expires. That expires on September 30. The House has yet to act on this. They are waiting for the Senate to act. We are trying to wrap up appropriations bills. The clock is ticking and we need to move forward with this so we can allow the House to go forward, get into conference, get the bills back here. 
I wonder if I can ask additional time from the Senator from Vermont? Maybe an additional minute or two. I don't know how much time is left.

Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. President, it is going to be extraordinarily difficult for us to finish our business on this bill, unify the different positions between the House and the Senate, and get the legislation to the President of the United States before September 30 so we do not have to lay off people at FDA, so we do not have to further delay review of devices and drugs and health-saving and health-improving and lifesaving products for the American people. 
That is what all this is about, is expediting the process; not to short-circuit the process but just to bring some efficiencies to the process. 
The United States lags dramatically behind our foreign competitors. But more important than that, we have American citizens who are being denied access to health-improving and lifesaving drugs and devices because of this huge backlog at FDA. So, we can continue to go through these debates, as the Senator from Vermont said, 2 pages out of 150 pages--an important part but a small part of the entire, overall reform bill. 
I hope we can come to some reasonable agreement in terms of bringing forward amendments; where there are disagreements, agreeing to a time limit on debate of those amendments, let each side present their case and then let the Senate vote on the matter and then move forward. Delay, delay, delay simply postpones what is, or at least what I believe is, inevitably going to happen and what should happen. That is that a majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate, on a bipartisan basis, and a majority of the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, and the vast majority of the American people, want to see changes in the current FDA so they can bring lifesaving devices and drugs and health-improving devices and drugs safely but efficiently to the marketplace so that people can utilize those without having to get on a plane and go to Mexico or a foreign country, so we do not have to keep shifting manufacturing facilities and jobs out of the United States into areas which have a more reasonable and effective review process. 
Many of us thought the device section was resolved and closed and that--at least last week it was presented that the only remaining item left on the agenda was the cosmetics. We went through great drama here over the problem with cosmetics. Now cosmetics has been agreed to. All of a sudden we are back onto devices. Many of us are concerned that even if this issue is resolved, we will suddenly have a new issue appear that will further delay the steps that we need to take here in the Senate to move this legislation forward. 
So, I ask our colleague from Massachusetts if we could at least set some schedule here to ensure that we do not go another week, that at least this week we complete debate on the amendments, move to final passage, and then allow the House of Representatives to begin their process. I am not asking him to respond. It's just a plea here that we have spent 2 1/2 years, and each day we delay we run into problems with reauthorization of PDUFA and we run into serious, considerable delay in terms of bringing in the processes which will allow us to more efficiently do the work, the legitimate work, of the Food and Drug Administration. 
How much time is left? I will be happy to yield whatever time is remaining back to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts offers expediting of this process. No one wants to keep delaying it. We have been in negotiation for months, if not years. This particular item has been discussed, debated, turned upside down, dissected. I think we are at the point where the best way we can expedite this is simply to have the amendment offered, have the debate, let the Senate work its will. There are Members on both sides who are willing and able to present the case, and then let the Senate work its will. 
Having said that, this Senator has on two occasions now responded to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who personally called and asked that I look at new language. I said I will be happy to look at new language, but it just seems every time we look at new language and make a concession, there is another issue that pops up. We made 30 some concessions. We don't want to have 31 and then 32. 
I appreciate the offer of the Senator from Massachusetts, and we will continue to operate in that spirit.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't need all the 5 minutes. I would be happy to yield back to the Senator from Vermont to wrap up before the cloture vote. It is unfortunate that we are in this position again. We had a substantially bipartisan, overwhelming vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I believe the vote was 89 to 5. I think that indicates a very broad level of support for the need to move forward with this legislation that was 2 1/2 years in the making. There is obviously a widespread, general consensus that FDA reform is necessary to provide better protection for the health and safety of Americans and to provide access to drugs and devices that Americans have been denied due to delays at FDA. We are trying to expedite that process. We are trying to bring in expertise from outside to help FDA, whether it is through the tax that is levied on prescription drug companies that goes to hire additional workers and provide additional resources for FDA, or whether it is for outside agencies, certified by FDA, to help them in the process of reviewing this tremendous backlog of applications for health-improving, and in many cases lifesaving, devices and drugs. 
What we are trying to do here is give FDA the kind of support and resources it needs, along with a pretty good shove in the right direction, to bring our agency up to world class standards and up to the task of effectively dealing with this exciting explosion of technology through which the American people can reap great benefits. 
I regret once again we have to go to a cloture vote. We just ran into a problem here, procedurally, with the amendment, the Senator from Iowa fearing that cloture would cut off his ability to offer a relevant amendment under cloture. I would say to the Senator from Iowa, none of us really wants to go to cloture. But in order to move this bill forward, it appears that we have to invoke cloture once again. 
I know under the rules of cloture, it limits the amendments as to relevancy. No one in favor of FDA reform wants to keep going through this process of invoking cloture, but unfortunately we have to do it in order to move the bill forward. 
Again, 2 1/2 years in the making, there were extensive hearings in the Labor Committee, efforts on a bipartisan basis to resolve problems and disputes, votes in committee, negotiations post-committee action, 30-some concessions or modifications in response to concerns that were raised postcommittee on this. So, none of us here supporting and promoting the movement forward of this legislation is trying to delay anything. We are just trying to expedite it. Nor are we trying to say, `Our way or no way.' There has been extensive negotiation, extensive accommodation, extensive work to move this bill forward in any way that we possibly can. 
So I urge my colleagues, as we did a week or so ago, I urge my colleagues to vote with us on cloture. We have no other choice, other than lengthy debate over items and issues that have been discussed over and over and over and voted on and negotiated. Clearly, we know where the Members of the U.S. Senate stand, both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. There is about as widespread support for this reform bill as any major legislation that has come before the Senate as long as I have been in here, for 9 years. It is time to move forward. Regretfully, we have to do it once again with a cloture motion. 
I urge my colleagues to help us move this very needed and very important legislation the next step forward. 
I yield back any remaining time I have to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are debating, here, under this limited time agreement, an issue that has received considerable discussion. There is considerable controversy over the issue of national testing. It has received enormous attention. 
When the issue was first raised in the context of this appropriations bill, Senator Gregg and I offered an amendment expressing our concern that we were going forward, here, with an issue of considerable controversy, without it being authorized and without hearings and without discussion as to the implications of this. We felt it deserved a full public discussion because there was great controversy over the idea of national testing. 
Unfortunately, the decision that was made on the part of the administration was to go forward with this initiative without congressional authorization. We attempted to address that issue with our amendment. But last August, without congressional approval or statutory authority, the Department of Education announced that it would develop a national test to be implemented in the spring of 1999, and went forward and awarded a $13 million contract to a consortium of testing companies. Instead of turning the proposed test program over to the National Assessment Governing Board, an entity with 10 years of experience in this area, the administration intended to bypass this procedure. Senator Dorgan spoke on the floor. We raised the issue. Senator Dorgan responded by saying he agrees with us that we would be far better off getting this out of the hands of the Department of Education and into the hands of an independent assessment agency to address some of this controversy about the Federal direction of how the test is derived and how it is administered and so forth. 
The President, in his radio address a week ago, stated that he would concede to the argument that many were posing, that this would be better if not designed and directed by the Federal Government. That, then, opened the door to our trying to find a way to constitute an outside independent agency to write the test and administer the test. Many of us, even with that, expressed real concerns about the whole concept of a national testing program versus allowing these decisions to be made at State and local levels. But it was clear that the issue was going forward. So, in response to that, what we attempted to do was negotiate with the administration, with our Democrat colleagues and others, to comply, essentially, with what Senator Dorgan was suggesting we do and what the President was suggesting we do. The initial proposal that the President had outlined maintained what we thought was a link with the Harvard education administration, which simply fueled the controversy. 
So, over the last several days we have had considerable discussion and negotiation with the administration on this, attempting to improve this process and really to reserve further debate, on whether there ought to be national testing or not be national testing, for the conference committee and for this body. There is a division of opinion on that, a division all along the ideological spectrum. Former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett said national testing can be beneficial if done the right way, if not manipulated to achieve a certain result or to drive a curriculum, but as an assessment tool. 
I quote from an article written by his former assistant, Chester Finn, Jr., who says:  
Properly done, standards-based national tests would provide useful information to students and their parents and put pressure on schools to improve. 
Congress, which created the National Assessment Group, NAGB, could easily design a program which would achieve the goals of national testing, being a useful tool in improving public education. 
The crucial questions [he says] about any test are who decides what's on [the test] and who sets the standards by which student performance is judged. 
We have set out to do that. I am pleased to announce that late last evening we were able to achieve agreement with the administration on the conditions upon which this would go forward. Under the agreement, and I will briefly explain it, no school or school district will be forced to use the national test if they don't want to. It is strictly voluntary. 
We also have provided that no school not using the test will in any way be denied the Federal funds that come to that school for various purposes. So, receipt of Federal funds is not conditioned on their using or not using the test. 
Further, we have provided that no private or parochial school or home-schooled individuals are forced to take a test without their consent. That was a legitimate response to some questions raised by home-schoolers and private and parochial schools. This is a key provision. Currently, States are using a variety of testing instruments to determine how their students are performing. Yet, according to many experts, this patchwork of tests does not provide a common yardstick by which parents and educators can compare results. And while it is true that testing won't help children learn more, it is equally true that testing can give us valuable information about how we are doing, and will ultimately be useful in providing tools for parents to use in holding schools accountable for their results. 
Second, the changes that we have made allow the National Assessment Governing Board the exclusive authority over all policies, directions, and guidelines for establishing voluntary national tests for fourth-grade English reading and eighth-grade mathematics. To assure NAGB's independence, the amendment provides that NAGB shall have the sole authority to award grants and contracts and otherwise operate independently of the Department of Education. The compromise which we reached gives NAGB 90 days to review and make substantial changes, if needed, in the contract negotiated by the Department of Education. 
Third, we have directed NAGB to ensure that the content and the standards for the national test are the same as those for the National Assessment of Educational Progress test, the NAEP tests. The President has stated on numerous occasions his intention to have voluntary national tests based on the well-respected, high standard of the NAEP test, and this amendment accomplishes that. 
Fourth, we have made numerous changes to the composition of the 25-member board, NAGB, to ensure bipartisanship and a new focus on locally elected officials rather than the so-called Washington experts. These changes include the addition of a current or former Governor, bringing the total number of Governors on the board to three; the addition of a new category, allowing participation of two mayors; two additional representatives of business or industry, bringing the total of that to three; and the elimination of five curriculum or testing experts who were employed by the board but should not have had voting privileges, a potential conflict of interest there. We have also increased the length of the terms on the board from 3 to 4 years in order to provide for more continuity. 
Fifth, the amendment returns to NAGB the authority it had prior to 1994 to nominate individuals to fill vacancies which occur on the board. Under this process, the Secretary must select from candidates nominated by NAGB. The amendment provides a 30-day transition, so that current vacancies and newly created positions are filled by the Secretary after consultation with the House and the Senate. 
These changes are critical to ensuring that national testing is under the supervision of an independent, bipartisan agency and not the Federal Department of Education. 
There is no doubt that standardized tests assess performance, but they do not generate it. Yet I am increasingly convinced that giving parents a better and possibly more accurate picture of their child's academic performance will help them obtain the best education for their child. These tests are simply another tool for parents to use in holding local schools and local systems accountable for providing the kind of opportunities for educational achievement that all children in America deserve. 
Mr. President, I have other Members who wish to speak on this. I reserve my time at this particular point.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Vermont. Before I do, let me just say that I recognize the legitimate concerns that the Senator from Missouri has raised, and that is why we negotiated a totally voluntary process and exemption for any school, any individual, any school district that does not want to participate does not have to participate without any jeopardy of losing any funds. 
So whether it is a home school, private school, parochial school, individual school district, whatever, if they agree with the Senator from Missouri--and I believe he raises some legitimate concerns--they don't have to participate in this at all. 
I now yield to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know this debate today doesn't have the fireworks that the debate on Friday had about FDA reform. I know we are today detailing some of the specifics of the reform legislation that is before us, but I think it is important for us to lay out this record as to why it is important to go forward with FDA reform and what the FDA reform bill that is before this Congress actually proposes. 
On Friday, I laid out the why of the need for reform, but I didn't lay out the what it is that we are actually doing to bring about this reform and what is included in this bill. I think it is important for our colleagues and Members to focus on the constructive things that we have done through our exhaustive process in the Labor and Human Resources Committee to conduct an FDA reform bill that can truly bring greater efficiency to this agency. 
On Friday, I indicated how much many of us resent the charge that we are somehow gutting the FDA. FDA is an important agency. It is an agency that does protect the health and safety of Americans, and we want to do all that we can to give that agency the kind of resources and the necessary support that it needs to continue that effort. Yet, clearly, I think the case that was laid out Friday indicates the need for substantial reform of the agency on how it does its business, how it is going to proceed in the future. 
Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts has stated the agency has improved so much in the last few years--and others have said the same thing, including a former commissioner--that it doesn't need congressional reform. I think the facts indicate otherwise. As I outlined on Friday, the agency can't come close to meeting its statutory deadlines for approval of either drugs or devices. There have been egregious examples of delays that have affected people's safety and health, and we want to do everything we can to minimize those delays and to make the agency a more constructive force in terms of dealing with these questions. 
The President's latest budget is outlined in this publication I have entitled `Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committee.' This is a backup document, material facts in terms of the President's budget decision, as to how much we should fund FDA for the next fiscal year. 
Having outlined all of these problems that exist at FDA in approving drugs, in approving devices and expediting the process and even beginning to attempt to meet their statutory requirements, it is astounding that the President's budget for next year does not only not strengthen the agency, it diminishes its effectiveness. 
The proposal here plans to cut the agency's total appropriated budget by 8 percent and cut the device center budget--that is the center that reviews and approves medical devices--by 27 percent. This is at a time when, if we need to do anything, we need to increase the funding for the agency or at least find ways to help the agency with outside sources to try to do its job more effectively and more efficiently. 
So that alone--I guess this was designed to meet some budget numbers, but it certainly doesn't square with the assertions that the agency is well on the way to solving its problems and, given a little more time and few more resources, those problems will be solved. It also flies in the face, I think, of the facts that have been presented on this floor in terms of the agency's inability to meet its statutory requirements for review and approval of devices. 
In just a couple of areas, with respect to the 510(k) submissions, the agency itself predicts that it will complete 6 percent fewer applications in fiscal year 1998 over fiscal year 1997 because it has fewer resources. It also predicts that it will review them 20 percent slower than it did in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1996, it took them an average of 110 agency days for review; in fiscal year 1997, 120 days; for fiscal year 1998 it is predicted to be 130 days and will only complete 40 percent of the submissions in the statutory 90-day period compared with 60 percent last year. 
So it makes no sense whatsoever to assert that the agency is well on the way to reforming itself and this legislation isn't needed when the agency's own predictions, own plan for what it is able to do with the resources it has for next year, indicates that it is going in the other direction, not toward reform, not toward more efficiency, not toward meeting their statutory requirements, but in the opposite direction. 
With respect to PMA applications, the agency has said, while it expects to receive slightly more PMA applications than in recent years, it will complete 27 percent fewer applications. In fiscal year 1997, they completed 75. But for fiscal year 1998, they predict they will only complete 55, and that they will review those applications 15 percent slower than last year, 250 days of review as opposed to 220 days, that they will complete only 35 percent within the first 180 days--that is the statutory limitation--as compared with 53 percent last year, and they will have a 17 percent increase in the backlog. 
If there has ever been justification for reform of FDA, it is in looking at their own estimates of what they will be able to do next year as compared to previous years. And so they are certainly not reforming themselves, certainly not going in the right direction. They are going in exactly the opposite direction. 
What we are trying to do here with this legislation that Senator Jeffords is leading the effort on--I might add with a lot of bipartisan support, both Republicans and Democrats, as indicated by the cloture vote last week with I think only five votes in support of Senator Kennedy's support of a filibuster. People want to move forward here. We know that hanging in the balance are decisions that can affect people's health and safety and their very lives. We want to do this in a more efficient and effective manner. So I think there is certainly justification for going forward with this reform bill. 
I just point out, for the benefit of my colleagues, that even after extensive debate and markup in the committee, which produced a vote of 14 in favor and only 4 against on the legislation that we are discussing today, there has been considerable negotiation. I have in my hand here a list of 33 separately negotiated compromises to try to accommodate the Senator from Massachusetts, four pages of single-spaced negotiations on 33 separate items to try to address the concern of the Senator from Massachusetts and a couple of other Senators on the committee who thought that perhaps we should have addressed these in committee. 
In good faith, we sat down with them and attempted to address their concerns. I know that Senator Harkin had a particular concern during the markup, and we were very close to getting an agreement on that. And I take responsibility for not accepting it at the time. In retrospect, I think Senator Harkin was correct. I think what he was suggesting in terms of how we classify medical devices and what devices will be eligible for outside third-party review was correct. And so we notified him of that. We worked with his staff, and we made the change. 
So the bill before us incorporates the change that he thought we should have made in committee. In retrospect, I wish I had made that change in committee. I think it probably would have changed the Senator's vote. And I think it would have been wise for us. We would have then had a 15 to 3 vote or maybe even a 16 to 2 vote if that was the case. In review of that action, that was one of the compromises or one of the negotiations that were made. 
But to say that, you know, we are standing here on the floor unwilling to look at reasonable requests for some of the concerns and objections of the Senator from Massachusetts, or from others, I think this undermines that assertion. Mr. President, 33 changes have been made to address the concerns raised by the Senator from Massachusetts and from others. 
Mr. President, I sincerely hope that we do not have to engage in another filibuster effort as we move to the bill itself and open the bill up for amendment and consideration. With that vote on Friday, only five votes in favor of proceeding with discussion of the bill, I think it would be a disservice to the American people, a disservice to the FDA, and to this body for us to engage in additional lengthy filibusters of this where we have to go to another cloture vote. 
So I hope that as soon as we finish the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill, we can move with a definitive timetable which will allow amendments to be offered, hopefully debated with some kind of limitation on the 
time so we can move and then vote on, and then move forward with this. It makes no sense to continue to delay it. 
Mr. President, let me just talk a little bit about what the bill includes--we talked about why we need it--about what the bill includes. 
Back in 1990, I authored legislation which would allow some expedited provisions within FDA for review of what is called humanitarian devices. These are devices that affect only a small class of people and really are not in the manufacturer's financial interest to proceed with these devices because there is not a broad enough market for them. But yet there are individuals that can benefit from these devices, and it makes no sense to have the same convoluted, time-consuming process, and particularly some of the specifics of what the FDA requires for approval of these devices, if the sum total of all of that discourages the manufacturer from going ahead because there is such a limited class for whom these devices are applicable. Then the only losers in this are the people for whom the devices could have improved their quality of life or perhaps have been of great benefit to their health. 
And so in 1990 we enacted some humanitarian device provisions. But since that time, as a result of I think what can only be described as bureaucratic delay and inefficiency, since that time only one company has been able to take advantage of this provision. The bill that we have before us expedites certain agency procedures. It allows a waiver of prior hospital review committee approval if the patient would suffer harm or death while waiting for supervised approval. So if a patient is in a position where waiting for approval could result in their death, it allows for the provision for a waiver of the agency procedures. 
In addition, the agency is ordered under this legislation to review the application in 75 days, and that is one of those compromises. We originally had 60 days. The agency thought they needed a little more time. We agreed to allow them to have 75 days. And the agency was no longer allowed to arbitrarily force the manufacturer to seek reapproval of the product. In the past legislation the approval was only good for a limited period of time and then they had to go through the whole procedure again to get reapproval. We are saying once the agency approves it, absent evidence to the contrary, that approval sticks. 
In addition, the humanitarian device provision is made permanent whereas before it had a sunset. Now, perhaps one of the most important parts of this legislation is the increased access to expertise, outside expertise, to allow the agency to accomplish its reviews and approval process in a much more expeditious timeframe. 
We, in the bill, require the FDA to enter into contracts with nongovernmental experts--non-FDA scientists and reviewers--to assist in product approvals. We are still talking about medical devices here to assist in product approvals if the agency determines that doing so would improve the timeliness or the quality of the review. 
It is important to understand that the agency is going to retain final approval authority over the review, but for the first time we are requiring them to utilize outside experts, outside resources to help them with that review. They are saying, `We're overwhelmed. We have all these applications. We don't have enough employees to review it. And that's why we 
have the delay.' We are saying, `There are organizations, institutions, agencies outside of the FDA that can help provide these reviews. We are asking you to look to these to provide some assistance. But you, the FDA, have approval authority.' In other words, it does not automatically go to an outside reviewing group, but it can go to a group that the FDA approves of. 
I do not see what the problem is with that. I mean, final authority rests within the FDA. But if there is an organization outside the FDA that the FDA can contract with or that the manufacturer can contract with, to expedite it, as long as FDA retains approval authority, then why not utilize this? It is going to expedite the process. 
The agency currently has a pilot program in place with which it is testing out this concept. We want to expand that pilot program. We would like to require that 60 percent of the nonexempt 510(k) submissions be included in the pilot. We also have language in here which limits the agency's ability to write all the guidance documents for these organizations. Sometimes the writing of the guidance documents takes months, if not years, and in a sense is unnecessary because the agency can allow the outside organization to go forward without that as long as it retains authority. 
We are concerned about a manufacturer contracting with an outside agency just to seek approval. And if the manufacturer were allowed the contract with that outside agency, and they just said, `OK, we reviewed it. Here is the approval. You have to take it,' there would be legitimate grounds for objection to that. But we have built in total oversight authority and control into the FDA so that they really are not giving up jurisdiction here, they are just utilizing that outside source to help them do their work. It is not like somebody subcontracting work out if they do not have the capacity to do it within their factory or within their business. 
But because public safety and public health is at risk here, we want to make sure that FDA retains sufficient authority to oversee all of this. FDA is given the authority in the bill to establish conflict of interest protections because we do not want to get into a situation where there is a conflict of interest between the manufacturer and the review authority. FDA decides what those protections are. FDA accredits the pool of qualified organizations. In other words, a manufacturer cannot go to any organization unless FDA has preapproved that organization, that outside agency for review. They have to get FDA's stamp of approval, good seal of approval, before they are even eligible to do the work to assist FDA. 
FDA selects from a pool of two or more accredited parties from whom the product sponsor may select. In other words, FDA says these agencies are certified to do this work; the company selects one or two or a pool of accredited parties, and FDA then makes that selection. FDA has authority to revoke the accreditation if it feels that it is not proceeding according to the way they want it to go. 
It has the ability to investigate any kind of conflict of interest and it has final approval authority. 
Now, this is important, this final approval authority. At one point, I threw up my hands and said the FDA has so much authority why are we going outside? Are we not just defeating the purpose? But in order to get the legislation addressed, we built in all these protections, additional protections, and of course the best protection of all for FDA is that it has final approval authority. 
If it does not like what comes back from the outside agency despite all these other steps where it accredits and so forth it can say we do not approve because we do not think the agency did such and such. So it has preapproval authority. It has process approval authority. It has final approval authority. That is plenty of protection. 
All of what you hear about how risky it is to American health and so forth, some agency which is not part of the Federal Government is involved in approving a particular product, that is not the case, because we have built into the legislation approval authority for FDA all up and down the line. 
Title III improves the collaboration and communication between FDA and the various drug and device companies. There is a list of items that I will not take time to detail. 
Title IV clarifies a lot of the rules currently in place and improves the certainty of the process. We address the whole question of policy statements. In recent years, FDA has increasingly developed informal policy statements without involving the public and has failed to make the policies available to the public. In response to a petition from citizens in my State, a group of Indiana manufacturers, the agency published guidance that radically changed these practices. The bill requires the FDA to make this `Good Guidance Practices" document permanent by promulgating it as a final regulation in 2 years. 
In the area of labeling claims for medical devices, in the past the agency has looked beyond a manufacturers' legitimate labeling claims and requires that the company making the product provide extensive data on a variety of claims for which the company never intended the product to address. The product was designed for a specific purpose. The FDA said we want you to conduct all kinds of trials and provide extensive data for what other things it might be used for, not for what the company is marketing it for, not for what the company has designed it for, but what it might be used for. That has clearly delayed the ability to review products and to get them approved. 
The bill clarifies the relationship of labeling claims to approval and clearance of products, and it further limits FDA's review of device submissions to the intended use of the device set forth in labeling. 
We tried to build in certainty of review timeframes. I will not go through the details of that, but that is extensive and brings some certainty to the process. 
We have placed some limitations on initial classification determinations. Recently the agency denied due process of law to manufacturers by withholding a substantial equivalence determination even when the product was in fact substantially equivalent whenever the manufacturer was determined to have even a technical defect in the GMP inspection. The bill prohibits the FDA from withholding the initial classification of a device based on failure to comply with unrelated provisions of the act, including good manufacturing practices. The agency is directed to use its ample existing enforcement authority to ensure that products that have the GMP violations at the time of classification do not reach the market. 
Title V, improving the accountability. It sets an agency plan for statutory compliance in an annual report so we have a better handle on what is going on within the FDA. 
Title VI, better allocation of resources by setting priorities. We exempt certain classes of devices from premarket notification requirements. This really expands on the administration's reinventing Government initiative that exempts class I and class II medical devices that pose little risk by exempting all class I devices, the least risk devices, except those that are important in preventing impairment of human health or presents potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. 
We had extensive discussion on this. This is an area where Senator Harkin raised what I believe are legitimate concerns and we have tried to address those concerns in this legislation. 
We have evaluation of automatic class III designations. Current law requires that all new devices not substantially equivalent to a device already on the market must be automatically classified in a highest-risk category. This does not make sense. If a very simple device that would otherwise be a class I or class II device is not substantially equivalent to a device already on the market, it has to be automatically classified as the riskiest of all devices and therefore falls into class III for the review process, and the approval process, which takes an extraordinary amount of time and requires an 
extraordinary amount of data, clinical trials and so forth. That is not necessary. So we have changed that so that it does not automatically fall into class III. 
It says `if it is not substantially equivalent,' what we have done here is allow the agency to make a determination as to which category it would fall in rather than automatically go to class III. So the agencies could look at it and say we think this is class I or class II and is subject to those review procedures rather than automatically moving into class III. It is a sensible change in the current status of how this is handled. 
We made changes regarding health care economic information, health claims for food products, and pediatric studies of drugs. 
Title VII, we have extended, and of course this is the engine that drives the train here, and another reason why it is so necessary to move forward with this legislation. We have reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee Act for 5 years. That is the so-called PDUFA legislation which the prescription drug companies have agreed to support. It is a tax on those companies for the specific purpose of providing extra funds for FDA to hire personnel to expedite the reviews of drugs which are submitted for review and approval to the FDA. 
It has worked out very, very well in response to an overwhelmed FDA who could not begin to meet their statutory requirements for review of drugs. A proposal was made that we would enact a tax against the companies submitting the product and the proceeds of that tax will be used to hire personnel and establish procedures whereby we could expedite the approval drugs. It was needed. It was supported. It has worked. We need to reauthorize it because it expires October 1 this year. That is why it is so important to move forward with this legislation. 
There are other things in the bill, Mr. President, but in the interests of time I will not detail them unless the President wants me to go through them point by point, but I do not think we have the time still allotted. I know the majority leader is anxious to move back to the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on this issue. It has been a cooperative effort that has reached across the aisle and involved Members from both parties in a very substantial number. Hopefully, we can move forward now in getting to the bill itself and the amendments and move this very needed legislation forward. I will be involved in this. I know there are a number of discussions coming up with some of these amendments. 
I appreciate the leadership and support of the Senator from Vermont, who is not testing but actually utilizing a medical device to address an unfortunate accident he had just last week. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to add my support, in a bipartisan way, to the remarks as stated by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Maryland and the efforts that have been undertaken by the chairman, Chairman Jeffords, and all of us on the committee over the past 2 1/2 years to move this bill forward. 
There has been extensive debate on this in committee, 2 1/2 years' worth. There has been extensive hearings on this. There has been extensive negotiation, and there has been extensive compromise on the part of those of us who are advocating FDA reform. 
We have made concession after concession after concession to Senator Kennedy and the administration and to those who have opposed our efforts in an attempt just to get the bill to the floor. Every time we solved one issue, a new one pops up that we had discussed over and over and over and voted on in committee, but it does not mean that we should not move forward with the process. 
All we are asking for today is to move this bill forward so that Senator Kennedy and others who have concerns with it can raise their objections, can debate it once again, can negotiate some more. But to stop the bill from going forward, to keep the drugs from being approved, to keep funds from going into FDA, to deny people the benefits from FDA approval of drugs and devices, simply because a Senator has a problem with one portion of the bill, I think certainly does not serve this body well. 
So I urge our colleagues to support the effort to invoke cloture so that we can move ahead with this.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking members who are ahead of me for allowing me this time. I have a schedule conflict and I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words. 
I will have more to say as we move forward with this legislation. I wanted to make some opening remarks. I am very pleased that we are actually here at this time with the legislation on the floor. It has been a long and arduous road that we have traveled over this past 2 1/2 years to address the need for FDA reform. We have, as the chairman and Senator Kennedy said, had numerous hearings. We have listened to the Commissioner of the FDA and his representatives and employees and colleagues. We have listened to outside experts. We have heard from the various industry groups. But the real reason that we are here is not just the fact that a few Senators got an idea that perhaps we ought to address some issues at FDA. The real reason we are here is that all of us have been besieged by consumers, by patients, by, yes, manufacturers of drugs and devices and others who have outlined to us the nightmare that exists at FDA in terms of approving products for beneficial use by patients. 
What I will primarily do this morning is briefly state the `why' of the need for FDA reform and save my remarks on what we have done--which I am sure will be outlined by many others--save my remarks on what we have done for debate on Monday, Tuesday, or following that, depending on how long this discussion goes on. 
First of all, let me state that the precipitating reason for moving forward was the need to reauthorize PDUFA. That is the user fee that is paid for by the drug prescription industry to allow FDA to hire additional personnel and to employ additional technology to speed up the approval of drugs. I am not sure who bears the responsibility for lack of personnel or lack of updating technology. 
I have worked with Senator Mikulski on a more comprehensive modernization of FDA, consolidating their campus, giving them the new technology that they need, and giving them the personnel that they need. Because SBA was in such desperate shape in terms of its ability to use drugs we enacted sometime ago a user fee whereby the industry itself would be taxed with the money designated specifically to hire the personnel and improve the process and procedures for approval of prescription drugs. That is what finally moved us from debate and delay to the NIOSH action. 
I am particularly pleased that Senator Jeffords, the chairman, responded to my concerns that if we move only with a limited PDUFA reauthorization we will have addressed only a small part of the problem that exists at FDA, that what we needed was a comprehensive bill, broad in scope, that would allow us to address a number of problems that exist at FDA, including substantive reform for medical devices and other products regulated by the agency. I commend the chairman for agreeing to do that. We held extensive hearings and broadened the scope of the bill. The bill we have put forward is one that does address a number of issues and that is why it receives such widespread support from the Congress. 
Clearly, the vote in committee, a strong bipartisan vote for moving this process forward in support of the comprehensive bill and the vote that was just taken this morning--overwhelming, almost historic in proportion--vote on cloture I think indicates the depth and the breadth not only of the bill but of the support for the bill with Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, everybody in between. Only a handful, literally a handful of Senators voted against cloture. So I think that shows the need for moving forward on this bill. 
FDA bureaucracy and delay, inconsistent rules, lack of willingness to use outside expertise--all of this has jeopardized the health of American patients. FDA opponents of reform like to state, `Oh, we cannot jeopardize the health and safety of Americans,' and yet in their insistence on maintaining virtually status quo in total FDA control on their assistance on that, they have denied Americans lifesaving and health-improving benefits both through prescription drugs and devices and other forms of medical assistance. They have denied people the opportunity to beneficially affect their health and have forced them to go outside the United States, forced manufacturing companies to go outside the United States, forced drug device companies to go outside the United States in order to market their product whereby they would be subject to the rules and regulations of foreign countries rather than this country. 
To imply that only the United States FDA has the wisdom to be able to determine what is in the best interests of the health and safety of its citizens is, I think, a slap in the face to countries like Germany, Britain, France, and others who have similar approval processes that benefit the citizens of their own country. 
FDA average review time, just taking medical devices, average review time for low- to moderate-risk medical devices, the so-called 510(k)'s in 1995 increased over the previous 6 years by over 200 percent, from 82 days to 178 days, for total review days from 66 days to 137 days for time actually in the FDA's hands. The law says they need to do this in 90 days--the law. We passed the law, a statute here that says that the FDA on low- and moderate-medical devices you have 90 days. The FDA said, OK, 90 days. In that period of time since we passed the law it has doubled in terms of the amount of time they take to review those. Those are average review times. 
Specific examples show how ridiculous and how scandalous the process is or has been at FDA. Fortunately, we are in the process of looking for a new Commissioner, and hopefully that Commissioner will bring some business sense instead of simply an ideological bent to the agency and provide for some expediting of some of the devices that do not pose serious health risk to Americans at all. 
We all hear about this whole idea that FDA is standing at the bridge, keeping Americans from being subjected to the most egregious of violations, drugs and devices perpetrated by a greedy industry that is concerned only about the bottom line. 
I have a device manufacturer in my State that makes hospital beds. That device manufacturer, which is well respected on a national basis, that device manufacturer designed a new bed cover. This is the cover you put over a mattress, on a bed. The bed had been approved, the mattress has been approved, the old device cover has been approved. It is a piece of cloth. But they designed a new one that prevents bodily fluids from leaking into the mattress. Obviously, that could be a potential health risk to not only that patient but perhaps a subsequent patient. So they had come up with a new mattress pad which achieved significant improvement in promoting the health of patients who would use that mattress. 
Of course they had to submit it to FDA for approval. This is a class I device, the lowest risk to the patient. So they submitted it to FDA, and the FDA took 476 days to review that mattress pad before it would grant approval. So we talk about the average review times and protection of the party but when you bring it down to specific examples of the ineptness and the bureaucracy that exists at FDA, there are examples on both sides. 
The other side likes to use relatively rare anecdotes and of course many of these go back 20, 30, and 40 years, and no one--no one in support of FDA reform--is stating we ought to compromise on health and safety. What we are trying to do is say we think we can expedite and utilize new technology that improves health and safety if FDA could get its act together. Now, if you takes 476 days to approve a mattress pad which clearly is in the benefit of the health and safety of hospital patients because it prevents bodily fluids from seeping through the currents mattress pad, 
then if it takes 476 days to do that, something is wrong at FDA. Meanwhile, new 510(k) notifications have dropped dramatically, from 7,000 annually in 1989 to a projected 4,800 in 1998. So high-risk, if you look at that, and novel device review times increased from 348 days to 773 days, on average. Many are far longer than that. Some have been languishing in the system for 4 and 5 years. 
Now, the statute says that FDA has 90 days on low to moderate risk, 180 days on high risk, and yet, FDA's average review time in 1995 is 773 days on high-risk and novel devices. So, clearly, something needs to be done. 
What the committee has tried to do is simply say, let's take an agency that we need, an agency that is important to the health and the safety of Americans and let's see if we can improve it, let's see if we can reform it. The best step and the first step was the resignation of the Commissioner, who admitted to the committee in what was one of the most astounding statements I have ever heard any agency head ever deliver, which was basically saying, `I am incapable of doing this. You in Congress are going to have to force me to do it. I need the pressure from Congress to do it.' Can you imagine a CEO of a corporation coming before the board of directors and saying, `I am not capable of running this company efficiently like you want me to, but if you will put pressure on me and force me to do it, then I can go to my vice presidents and say the board is insisting that I do this'? Is that an example of the weakest form of management and oversight that you can possibly imagine? I could not conceive that the then Administrator, Dr. Kessler, of the FDA would make such a statement. `I am incapable of doing it, but you force me to do it and then maybe I can convince the people that work for me that we ought to do something.' 
Well, let me talk about another example of intolerable delays. This isn't a mattress pad. This goes to life and death. The product was a stent, a small, mesh, spring-like device used to keep coronary arteries from closing. A new stent product that was developed by a manufacturer was submitted to the FDA in November 1986. In August 1987, FDA said, `We need more paperwork.' It took them that long to figure out they needed more paperwork. In April 1988 and in August 1989 and in June 1991 were additional requests for more paperwork. An FDA panel meeting was held in May 1992, and they gave unanimous approval to the product. Four years after it was first submitted, an FDA panel gave unanimous approval to the product. It then took the agency an additional year to issue a letter allowing the device to go to market. 
Now, have you ever heard of such bureaucratic ineptness? After 4 years of reviewing paperwork on a life-saving device, on which the statute said the FDA had 180 days--after 4 years, the FDA panel met and gave unanimous approval. From that time, it took 1 year for the FDA to issue the letter saying, `Congratulations, you have been approved.' 
Now, critics of reform talk about the potential threat to American health and safety for approval of devices. But they never talk about the demonstrated not only threat but consequence to the safety and health and even life of Americans for ineptness and delay in the approval of drugs. How many people died or suffered serious incapacity because a life-saving stent on which we could not get a letter of approval from FDA, which approved it, until 1 year later? How many people, over a 5-year period of time, lost their lives because a life-saving device didn't receive FDA approval for 5 years? Let's say it took 4 years; let's grant them that it took 4 years of reviewing paperwork to make sure that this life-saving stent device was worthy of FDA approval. There is no excuse. What possible excuse could there be for a delay of 1 year in submitting the letter so the company could go ahead and market the product? 
Dr. Frist, who is a member of our panel, said, `I would have loved to have had that stent. I known what that stent does. I've used that stent. Had I known that stent was available before approval * * *'--to think that it was languishing in FDA 1 year after FDA approved it unanimously--it took them a year to get the letter out so that they could market the device. So there are people lying in their graves. 
This Senator is tired of hearing about FDA being the guardian of the health of Americans and we should not move forward with any kind of reform at all. When you touch the words `reform of FDA' and try to move up their approval process or expedite the process at all, why, then you are jeopardizing the health and safety of Americans. The burden of that lies on the shoulders of those who won't move forward with responsible reform. 
Fortunately, today, this Senate, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote--only five people opposed--said it is time to move forward with reform and it is past the time to move forward with reform. We owe apologies to the families of the Americans who have been denied life-saving treatments and devices because people have blocked reform and efforts to move forward.

Mr. COATS. I understand that shortly the Senator from Alaska will make a proposal that is certainly acceptable to Senator Lieberman and I, and I will be very brief in my comments. 
I am pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut in coauthoring and cosponsoring this amendment to increase funding for charter schools. Clearly, we are in a situation where I think there is a growing recognition that the status quo in our public schools is unacceptable, particularly our public schools located in low-income and urban areas. That status quo has existed for quite some time. 
It has been nearly 13 years since the President's commission reported about mediocrity in public education. We have seen numerous attempts both through public policy and through local initiatives to try to address the mediocrity and improve educational opportunities for our young people. We have met considerable resistance from the Federal Government, from the Department of Education, because they do not want to upset the status quo. Yet parents are voting with their feet and with considerable sacrifice and demanding at local and State levels that change be made. They are demanding alternatives. 
Senator Lieberman and I have explored a possibility of vouchers for low income, providing parents who do not have a choice, a choice that most of the rest of us have, that if their failing public school is not educating their young people they would have some means and wherewithal to utilize a voucher to achieve a better education. 
This is not that amendment. This is an amendment that addresses another alternative, a viable alternative called charter schools that Senator Lieberman has said is being more and more accepted throughout America. Even the Department of Education, in releasing its first formal report on the study of charter schools, has some findings indicating that charter schools have racial compositions similar to statewide averages, and in many cases have a higher proportion of minority students. So the charge that they are just for a certain race or just for the elite is not a well-founded charge. 
Sixty percent of public charter schools are new startups rather than conversions of public and private schools to charter status. They enroll roughly the same percent of low-income students on the average of other public schools. So a lot of red herrings about charter schools undermining the effectiveness of public schools is not proven. 
The Hudson Institute, located in Indianapolis, has undertaken a very significant and comprehensive study of charter schools called Charter Schools in Action. Their research has involved visiting 14 States, 60 schools, and visiting thousands of teachers and students. The key findings are that three-fifths of charter school students rate their charter school teachers as better. Over two-thirds of parents say the charter school is better than the child's previous school with respect to class size and school size. Over 90 percent of the teachers are satisfied with their charter school educational philosophy, their size, colleagues and students. And among students who said they were failing at their previous school, more than half are now doing excellent or good work. 
The gains were dramatic, most dramatic for minority and low-income youngsters, and were confirmed by their parents. 
In summary, the Hudson Institute study found charter schools point to important ways to improve and reinvent public education as a whole. The implications from the success of charter schools indicate that successful public schools should be consumer-oriented, diverse results oriented and professional places that also function as media institutions in their area. 
Because of the tremendous success of charter schools in the past 6 years, I joined Senator Lieberman in an attempt to double the funding. As Senator Lieberman pointed out, they offer great accountability, broader flexibility for classroom innovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. 
Senator Lieberman and I have addressed what we think are some offsets to provide for this doubling of funding to encourage charter schools. There has been some concern about where that funding comes from. I think there are some creative, innovative, and useful offsets, but it would engender considerable debate and discussion and might undermine this effort. Senator Stevens has found, I think, a very acceptable way to address this, and I appreciate his involvement and his efforts and his support for this. 
With that, I thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, for his initiatives, and I am pleased to join him in this. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. I felt compelled to give the other side of the story. Yesterday, when I offered the fetal tissue amendment to the Parkinson's legislation, I had discussed the matter with Senator Wellstone. I had indicated I was willing to take a 20-minute time agreement on the amendment, 10 minutes on each side. I didn't want to do anything that unnecessarily delayed the bill. I was informed that it was not--it was acceptable to Senator Wellstone but it was not acceptable to Democratic Members who wanted to speak on the bill but didn't want to do it yesterday. That is within their rights. We could have proceeded. We didn't. 
This Senator agreed to allow to be pulled over until this morning. I once again offered a time limit, and the time limit was not acceptable. So we essentially sat here for 2 1/2 hours this morning listening to Members of the party of the Senator from Massachusetts oppose the amendment, which they have a right to do. But there was no delay initiated on the part of the Senator who offered the amendment, nor was there any delay on the part of the majority leader. 
In regards to the FDA legislation, we were ready to go with that legislation before the recess, and it was the Senator from Massachusetts who prevented us from doing that. The Senator has every right to do that. If he has an objection to a part of the bill, he has a right to utilize the rules of the Senate to stop the bill from moving forward. But the facts are that the Senator doesn't have the votes. I didn't have the votes on some of my amendments. I didn't have the votes on fetal tissue, but I didn't stand here and insist the Senate stay in on a day when Members from both sides made plans and made travel plans just because I didn't have the votes or I couldn't get my way. 
The Senator does not have the votes for the bill. He did not have them in the committee, and he does not have them on the floor. There is widespread support for the FDA reform bill, including the cosmetics provision which was voted on in committee. We had debate, and we voted on it in committee. The Senator didn't have the votes from the opposition party, didn't have the votes from his own party. He doesn't have the votes on this floor. 
If he wants us to go through this exercise on a motion to proceed--this is just the procedure to start debate on the bill--why doesn't the Senator do what the rest of the Senators are doing, and that is, move forward on the bill, make your argument, have a vote, count the votes? If you win, you win; if you lose, you lose. But you can use the rules of the Senate. It is a right to the minority. We have used it. If the Senator wants to do that, he has the opportunity to do that, but it inconveniences everybody else, and if you think it is going to change the result, maybe it is worth it, but if it is just to be obstinate or intransigent because you didn't win or your point of view isn't accepted by your fellow colleagues, it puts everybody else at a disadvantage. To imply the majority leader----

Or the Republicans have somehow conspired to deny the Senator from Massachusetts the right to make his point or to argue his point, my goodness, we have been hearing that over and over and over and over. We know what the Senator's position is. He has the right to argue it, and he has the right to delay it. Let's make sure it is not implied somehow there is some devious effort on the part of the Republicans to deny the Senator his opportunities.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we will be resuming discussion of the amendment I offered last evening. I don't intend to repeat all that I said last evening. I do know there are a few other Senators who wish to speak on this amendment, and, hopefully, we can accomplish that in a reasonable time and then move to a vote. 
It is not my intention to utilize this amendment as a means of delaying a vote on the larger appropriations bill or specifically on the amendment that we adopted last evening, increasing funding for Parkinson's research, an amendment I supported and worked together with Senator Wellstone and others on this effort. I was pleased the Senate adopted my amendment related to the whole area of medical research so that we can commission a study which would give us, before the next appropriations and authorization cycle, a better idea of how we can direct research funds to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. 
There are allocations currently made on the basis of who has the best lobbying effort and perhaps who has the best champion in the Congress. While I don't in any way mean to impugn the motives of anyone here who is putting their heart and soul into providing support for research on a disease that affects them or that they believe is important and critical, I do think that in the interest of the widespread number of diseases that are currently under research at NIH and other places and the Federal funds that are used for that research, having a better understanding of where we can best apply those dollars to achieve the breakthroughs that can prevent the suffering and, hopefully, provide the cures for a number of these diseases is the direction we ought to go. We adopted that amendment last evening, and I am pleased the Senate supported that. 
This particular amendment is designed to address a specific issue that relates to the utilization of human fetal tissue in research in a number of neurological disease areas. There is a broader question of whether we ought to utilize human fetal tissue and put restrictions on how that is sustained as applies to neurological research in a whole number of areas--Parkinson's, diabetes, and there are a number of other neurological traumas that this could apply to. However, this specific amendment applies only to research in Parkinson's. 
I offer it because this is really the issue in terms of where we are applying specific research and increase in research dollars, and we will leave the discussion as it applies to other neurological disease research areas to the NIH reauthorization bill or a more appropriate time. But I believe it is relevant to this particular issue because we are addressing the question of Parkinson's research. 
I will summarize the two arguments that I made last evening. One is that we really don't have a pressing need to utilize human fetal tissue obtained through abortions other than human fetal tissue that is obtained through spontaneous miscarriages and through ectopic pregnancies. Because we have available to us some information that indicates that there is a diminishing viability of the utilization of human fetal tissue for Parkinson's research--it hasn't proved to be the promising breakthrough that we once thought it would be--there are alternatives to the utilization of human fetal tissue, specifically cell engineering, specifically utilization of animal fetal tissue, genetic engineering, and some other alternatives. 
Second, there are more promising areas of research that don't involve human fetal tissue at all, that involve brain implants, that involve a number of other research areas which I could detail, but I did last evening and I won't do that again. 
More importantly, however, than the question of whether or not this is even necessary to continue significant and important human fetal tissue in Parkinson's research, more importantly and most importantly, there are ethical considerations that I believe ought to give us significant pause before we just simply allow the utilization of human fetal tissue research. 
A number of moral and ethical questions have been raised, and I raised those last evening. I think Members ought to consider those, particularly those who perhaps don't have a personal concern about the utilization of fetal tissue research. It ought to be considered by them particularly since we have alternatives that allow us to address this problem without utilization of human fetal tissue for this research. If medical research becomes dependent on widespread abortion--and this is a concern because if human fetal tissue is determined to be effective in treatment, when we look at the whole widespread area of neurological research, we are talking of potentially utilization of fetal tissue of up to 20 million fetuses. That presents a wrenching dilemma for those of us, and I think that is most of us in this body, who believe that abortion ought to be rare, if not banned. For those who say it ought to be legal, safe and rare, we certainly would not be moving down a path that would allow us to limit abortions to only those that are most medically necessary. 
Second, let me just say that the dilemma that is posed is that the person who is responsible for the termination of the life of the child is the very person who gives the consent for the use of fetal brain tissue from that particular child. It is not consent of the child for utilization of the tissue. The very person who volunteers to have an induced abortion gives consent for the utilization of fetal brain tissue for one who has no voice in that consent. I think that presents a real ethical and moral dilemma that each of us ought to contemplate before we cast our vote in favor of the use of human fetal tissue. 
Third, I think there is a concern that we might be encouraging abortion by covering it with a veneer of compassion. `After all, there is a benefit,' the thinking goes. `There is a benefit to this abortion because the product of the abortion can be used in alleviating human suffering.' 
We all want to alleviate human suffering. We all want to do everything that we possibly can to find a cure for these diseases. And yet we have to be confronted with the moral and ethical dilemma of the possibility of the abortionist, the person encouraging the abortion, covering the fundamental underlying question about the life of a child by saying, `Well, after all, we can mitigate your concerns because look at the good that it will do, the side benefit of the good that it will do.' Ultimately that is a question that is a great question that ought to be pondered by each of us before we just simply say there is a great benefit to this fetal tissue research. 
So on the narrow question of whether or not fetal tissue is necessary for significant Parkinson's research, I think we have answered the question in saying it isn't. There are alternatives available and there are many more promising areas of research that can lead us to breakthroughs in Parkinson's research. 
And on the question of the moral, ethical dilemma, we can address that dilemma, particularly in this specific narrow area, by not allowing the use of human fetal tissue research with the exception that the research can go forward with fetal tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions or fetal tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancies. 
So it seems to me that we have addressed this issue in a way that allows the research to go forward, utilization of alternatives other than induced abortions, on a voluntary consent basis, and in ways that will not present us with this horrible ethical and moral dilemma that I think deserves great consideration before Members vote. That is the crux of the dilemma that I have presented. I hope Members consider that carefully before they cast their votes and not simply be caught up in `this is anti-Parkinson's, this impedes Parkinson's research, this has nothing to do with abortion, this has nothing to do with the fundamental moral questions here.' 
We can address this and then save and reserve the greater debate in terms of utilization of human fetal tissue for other neurological research at a time when we are addressing that specific bill. So that is the crux of the argument, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor at this particular point in hopes that we can move forward to a successful resolution of this particular issue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me make two points. One is that I don't need to be reminded by the Senator from California about the ravaging effects of Parkinson's disease, having watched my grandfather suffer and die from Parkinson's, and having watched my father suffer and die from complications from Parkinson's. I am well aware of the debilitating nature of Parkinson's disease. I think many of us have had personal experiences with that. I have not mentioned that before. But I think the implication is that if one truly understood Parkinson's, you couldn't begin to support the Coats amendment. I think I truly understand Parkinson's and what it does and how it affects an individual, how it affects family and loved ones. There is the very real possibility that it is genetically induced and that I may go through the same experience. 
Second, let me just state for those who suggest that there is no hope for the millions of Parkinson's sufferers, there is great hope for the millions of Parkinson's sufferers. There is hope because, No. 1, fetal tissue research can continue if the Coats amendment is adopted. I do not deny research utilizing human fetal tissue through this amendment. I simply say that that fetal tissue cannot be obtained through induced abortions. It can be obtained through spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, or ectopic pregnancies. 
But, second, there is hope because there are so many viable, wonderful alternatives that are now being researched which offer far more promise than the fetal tissue research. If you want to continue fetal research--and it probably should be continued--that fetal tissue can be obtained through sources other than human fetal tissue. In fact, it is much more promising now using animal tissue. There are a number of alternatives being explored, both through the use of cell engineering techniques, genetic engineering, and other developing cell lines. 
There are also alternatives outside tissue research that hold some promise. Perhaps the recent discovery of a gene that has an effect on Parkinson's, which perhaps is the cause of Parkinson's, albeit for a percentage of people and not for all the people, offer hope. So there is great hope. There is great promise in Parkinson's research. And nothing in this amendment denies that hope, denies that promise. 
So I think Members need to understand when they are voting for the Coats amendment that it is a way to preserve and continue Parkinson's research. But it is done so in a way that avoids what I think is a potential significant, ethical, and moral dilemma in terms of utilizing human fetal issue without the consent of the person giving the tissue. 
The very person who makes the decision to terminate that life is not the person who gives the consent to utilization of the tissue. That is a moral and ethical dilemma that I think is important for us to explore. 
So for those two reasons, I think the Coats amendment is more than a reasonable amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, just in summarizing before we vote at 12 o'clock on the Coats amendment, let me just, for Members' information, clarify things here. 
This amendment does not prohibit all Federal funding for fetal tissue research. Fetal tissue research can go forward. It allows fetal tissue research to go forward with tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancies and spontaneous abortions. It does prohibit Federal funds from being used for research on fetal tissue obtained by induced abortions only. 
We encourage research in the most promising areas of Parkinson's disease with animal tissue transplants, gene-based therapy, deep-brain stimulation. 
So this applies not to diabetes research, not to other neurological research--just to this. Other alternatives exist. Even fetal tissue could go forward. 
I hope our colleagues will understand the practical nature of this and the ethical and moral considerations of doing this, and I urge a vote in support of my amendment.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, let me first say I very much appreciate the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire in addressing this issue. I think it is an important issue and one which goes to a topic which deserves and needs a great deal of discussion and debate. 
Clearly, our public education system in this country has many cracks in the once solidly supported and, I think, respected position that it once had. We have many failing public schools, not just in our major cities, but across our land. The goal that we share, whether you are Republican, Democrat, liberal or conservative, is that we want to improve education in this country and we want to address some of the shortcomings that we find in education. 
The Senator from North Dakota raised a point which in many instances I think I do not disagree with. We do want to find ways of assessing where we are educationally, and giving parents a better idea of where their schools are in terms of preparing their children for a successful future. 
The proposal to look at reading levels of achievement at the end of the third grade in reading and in eighth grade in math is not necessarily a goal that we should not attempt to reach. The concern that was raised by the Senator from New Hampshire is that if we address this in a way in which the Department of Education controls and designs the way this will be tested and then potentially uses this to establish standards, we continue a process of Federal Government knows best in terms of how to fix the education system in this country. 
Frankly, the positive changes that are being brought about in the education of the young people in this country are not coming from Washington. They are coming from local and State initiatives. We do not want to do anything that deters that. In fact, we want to do everything we can to encourage that. I think it is safe to say if the initiatives that have been proposed and tried and are being tested and used in a number of our local educational jurisdictions and in a number of our States had to have the approval of the Federal Government, we would have gotten nowhere. We would not have charter schools in this country if the Department of Education had to approve it. We would not have had many of the experimental programs aimed at better addressing the situation of our at-risk children who are learning very little, or not at all, in many of our public schools, and particularly our public schools in urban areas across this country, because the national education unions have a lock on the public school process and a lock on the Department of Education. 
I have been in the Chamber proposing a number of new initiatives, most in the form of demonstration programs which merely ask that we test a new idea to gauge its effectiveness. I do this so often because the only thing we know about the current system for sure is that it is failing many of our children. So why not try something new, why not experiment with some new ideas? And if it works, then decide how we want to encourage it. And if it does not work, throw it out and try something else. But what we have is a Department of Education locked into a no-change system because the teachers unions, not merely the teachers but the teachers unions, say don't touch it--no merit pay for teachers, no changes in the rules on tenure. They just fight every change that is proposed. 
And so when the idea comes along of OK, let's set a testing standard so that we know where we stand, it looks good on its face--I think we all want that information; it can be useful to local jurisdictions and useful to States. But what we do not want is to get into the situation we got into with the national history standards whereby Federal bureaucrats and the organizations that currently control funding for public education basically say we will define what those standards ought to be, and we will set those standards and then we will measure the test against those standards. 
We don't want to get into that trap again. We went through that not a short time ago, and those standards were soundly rejected because they were taking us in absolutely the wrong direction. 
Now, I think that we can address the goals raised by the Senator from North Dakota, which I think Senator Gregg and I share in, of trying to find a way to provide local educational institutions and States with information about where students stand relative at least to reading and to math at fourth and eighth grade levels without falling into the problem that we would have if the administration were allowed to go forward with its original plan. 
What the Senator from North Dakota apparently was not aware of was that the Department of Education has already begun developing tests, and has already contracted with a consortium of testing agencies whereby the Department of Education defines how this is going to be done, without using an independent agency. 
Now, the President just this past Saturday in his national radio address wisely concluded that was not the direction the American people wanted to go, or that was not the way in which we ought to pursue this concept of trying to find where we stand at certain levels in regard to the subjects of reading and mathematics. And so the President announced on Saturday that he would defer to the critics' complaints that this should be done by an independent agency and should not be administered or controlled by the Department of Education. 
What Senator Gregg and I are trying to do is to hold the President to his word, so that it is not just something said on a radio address but it is something that is actually fulfilled by members of his own Department of Education. So the amendment that was offered was intended to prohibit the use of funds in this act, or any act, for the development or implementation of a national testing program. 
Now, we know that the Department has already signed a contract to begin developing this testing program, and as a consequence of that we are now trying to send a signal to the Department encouraging them to slow down. This is something that the Congress should debate, as the Senator from North Dakota said. This is something that the Congress should authorize. This is something on which the will of the people should be heard, that the input from the education institutions at the local and State levels ought to be heard before we proceed with this national effort. This truly should be a decision that is not first made in Washington and imposed on the States, but rather one that is first supported in State capitols and local jurisdictions around the country and only then decided on by Congress. 
Because there is a question raised about what the underlying amendment is intended to accomplish, I propose that we pause here, and agree to work together, as the Senator from North Dakota said, to achieve what many feel is a desirable goal. I think it would be helpful for local educational agencies and for States to have an assessment of where their students are. I think it would be helpful for parents to know how their schools are performing and measuring up in relation to other schools. I think that puts pressure for change on the system. 
I am trying to avoid the situation that we have frequently encountered after the passage of education legislation of parents getting involved because they don't like what is going on in Washington. For instance, if we don't take the time to check whether parents really want national testing, if they are unhappy, they will call up their Congressman and they will call up their 
Senators. They'll say, wait a minute; we are not so sure about this new Federal initiative to fix the problem of poor student performance because it looks like more Federal control. Federal control in education hasn't worked very well in the past, and we are not sure it is going to work in the future. Besides how does the Department of Education conclude it knows what is best for the education system when it has been over 15 years since a blue ribbon commission came out with a shocking report talking about the mediocrity of public education in America, and since then the only real reforms that have taken place have not been at the Federal level; reforms have been at the local and the State level, and we want to preserve the right of local jurisdictions and States to make those reforms. 
So I am offering a second-degree amendment to the underlying amendment which says that no Federal funds can be used for national testing until Congress has specifically authorized those tests. It does not say that we should not pursue the goal of some type of national testing. But what it does say is that the Congress ought to debate this and it ought to be authorized by the Congress before the administration, through the Department of Education, simply goes forward. 
My second-degree amendment says that none of the funds made available in this act, or any other act, will be used to develop, plan, implement, or administer any national testing program in reading or mathematics unless the program is specifically authorized by Federal statute. 
The operative phrase is that you can't go forward with this and use Federal funds unless it is specifically authorized by the Congress. That allows us to engage in the debate that the Senator from North Dakota thought we ought to engage in, and I agree that allows us to define how this testing will take place, that allows us to acknowledge the concern that the Senator from North Dakota expressed that maybe we do not want the Department of Education running this. 
Having been involved in the issue of student loans over the past several years and raising objections to the Department of Education taking over the student lending business, which it says it can do more effectively and more efficiently than the private sector, I find it ironic that Congress Daily reports that the Department of Education has had to suspend all direct loan consolidation efforts because it is overwhelmed by the effort. It cannot handle the work. And so students who want to consolidate their loans in terms of paying them back are now not able to do so because the Department of Education cannot handle it. 
A number of us, including Senator Gregg and many others, have raised concerns about the ability of the Department of Education to properly manage and administer the very complex business of making and collecting student loans. Frankly, we have never thought that they have the capacity to handle it. It is not that they are not well intended. The problem is there are no competitive pressures. They do their own thing. And it is the nature of bureaucracy--that is why it is called bureaucracy--to become bureaucratized and inefficient. 
I remember when the First Lady was here promoting her health plan, and in her first presentation to the Congress to two of the committees here, one of which I sit on, I said it seems to me that this massive national health plan is based on a number of faulty assumptions, one of which is that Government can accomplish an objective more efficiently and effectively than the private sector. I said that in my experience in 18 years in government and in my reading over the history of this Government, I have not been able to identify an area where the Federal Government has performed a service more effectively or efficiently than the private sector. I said, can you name me one? And the First Lady said, `Well, Senator, I think you are correct in terms of past performance of the Federal Government, but this time we think we have it right.' We think, in terms of the health care plan that was being proposed here by Mr. Magaziner and herself, that we can avoid that problem. 
As we have learned, that health care plan was rejected overwhelmingly by the American people because they had no faith that the Federal Government could take 15 percent of our economy, the entire health care system of the United States, and turn it over to Government to run with any assurance that it would be run effectively and efficiently. 
And, therefore, those of us who have a philosophy grounded in the free enterprise system are very skeptical about new proposals to inject the Federal Government further and further into those efforts handled by the private sector. 
So, at the very time the Department of Education now admits that it can't handle a small fraction of the lending business that is the consolidation of loans, and that it is going to take months and months and months for it to get its act together, if then, it now wants to enter into a new area of national testing, who knows where this is going to take us. And of course, who knows how many additional people will have to be assigned to have to administer this, to oversee the contracts and define the standards. 
Those are the concerns that Senator Gregg and I have, and those are the concerns we are trying to address. What we would like to do with this amendment, then, is simply follow up on the President's concession last Saturday and basically say, No. 1, this should not be done by the Federal Government, should not be done by the Department of Education, it ought to be done, if done at all, through an independent agency. And since we are dual players in this town, both the administration and the Congress, in doing the people's business, this is something the Congress ought to authorize. Therefore my second-degree amendment would prohibit funds from being used to further this national testing program until it is authorized by Federal statute. 
The chairman of the relevant appropriations committee, Senator Specter, will be holding hearings as early as tomorrow whereby the Secretary of Education will come forward, as well as Mr. Goodling, whom I deeply respect in terms of his experience with education. They will both come to testify as to the pros and cons of national testing. I think we need hear those pros and cons. I think we need to debate those pros and cons, and then I think we need to go forward and make a decision as to how we proceed. 
Again, I say this as someone who is not unalterably opposed to national testing for reading in fourth grade and math at eighth grade. Frankly, one of the reasons I want these tests is because I think it will draw more attention to the failure of the public system to educate our children. When we look at the disparities that exist in public education in some of our schools and we look at some of our efforts, I think it will put additional pressure on the public system to open up, to try new alternatives, and parents will be demanding that we provide better education for their children and different ways of providing that education. So, from that standpoint, I think national testing can be of benefit. 
With that, Madam President, I send my second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to add my support to this. I have been a supporter of additional funds for Parkinson's. But in the process of all of this, and serving on the committee, I have raised, on a number of occasions, my concerns that we are making decisions about which diseases, which research centers at NIH receive the funds. We are making that decision, I think, in well-intended ways, in ways that we hope will direct funds to provide breakthroughs and better research and hopefully cures for some of these diseases, yet I have been concerned we are doing it on a piecemeal basis. 
I am concerned that those organizations which have the greatest lobbying clout, who have been able to contact the most Senators or Congressmen, the ones who have generated the most support at home or who are best organized have become those that are rewarded by passage of legislation like this, and that those who do not have the lobbying expertise, the lobbying clout, do not have the same kind of friends in Congress that others have and end up being shorted. As a consequence, we are making decisions on the basis of anecdotal evidence--and some scientific evidence--but on the basis of political decisions as much as scientific decisions. 
Medical research is a complicated field. NIH is a wonderful organization that attempts to direct funds in ways that will ensure that research dollars are going into those areas where the best results can be obtained. And yet, in my visits to NIH, and talking with a number of people out there, and my observation of the process here, it is clear that those funds are not always directed in the most expeditious manner, not always directed in ways that provide the most hope in terms of finding breakthroughs and in finding cures. 
Having said that, there is no question that Parkinson's research over the years has been shorted. In 1994, it had a funding rate of $26 per patient, the lowest of all the major diseases, yet it affects one million or more Americans. Its direct funding in 1994 was only $26 million, the lowest dollar number of all the major diseases. 
So I think it is important that we recognize that here is a debilitating disease that affects a million or more Americans, that has had a personal impact on many of us and our families, that has generated a very effective organization that supports research, increased funding for research, but at the same time I 
think we have to acknowledge or we should acknowledge and recognize that this is not the best way to go about allocating funds for research at NIH, that the lobby group that is the most effective or the Members who are in the best position to direct the funds because of their committee positions or whatever, that is not the way that we ought to be allocating research dollars. 
We ought to be doing it on a meritorious basis, one that is supported by medical science, one that receives the recommendation of independent researchers or an independent body or medical experts that certainly have more expertise in this area than we do. I say that because if you look at the list of diseases and the centers and the way we fund those, there is clearly an imbalance. We clearly are directing funds to areas where research is unnecessary or is duplicated. We clearly are not directing funds to areas where we need research. 
I have discussed this with NIH officials. I have been told--and will not quote any names--but I have been told by people who are in a position to know, they are duplicating and in some cases tripling the amount of funds going into the same research simply because they are directed by the Congress to fund that specific disease. And, of course, any duplication or triplication or every excess dollar that has to be spent because it is politically directed to be spent and not medically necessary or scientifically required and going to meritorious studies is a dollar that does not go into some other research, whether it is direct research or indirect research, that could offer potentially life-saving breakthroughs in other diseases. 
Just an example or two. All of us have heard about Parkinson's, and we are going to increase Parkinson's here. And I am going to support that increase. I will say this. This is the last specific research dollar increase that I am going to support until we have an outside organization that can give us some recommendations as to how to allocate our money. This `disease of the month' or who has the best lobby or who has the most influential friends in Congress is not the way that we ought to be directing research funds. But I have been a long-time supporter of Parkinson's. 
They have made their case. But I have told them I am not going to continue on this basis. I will support the bill this year, but I am going to be adding shortly an amendment that Senator Frist will speak to, of which I would like to add him as a cosponsor, which will initiate this study so that we would have a report so that in next year's appropriations process we have before us the information we need in order to make rational decisions, meritorious decisions rather than just simply political decisions. I don't mean just simply political decisions, but decisions that are not wholly supported by medical science. 
Very few people have heard of polycystic kidney disease, PKD. I had not heard of it until I was visited by a friend of mine who introduced me to the disease. PKD receives a ridiculously low appropriation, and yet PKD is a disease that affects 500,000 Americans. It affects their kidneys in a way that they do not function. And yet, as a Government, because kidney dialysis is covered under Medicaid and Medicare, we spend untold millions of dollars in paying the bills for kidney dialysis when we provide virtually nothing for research in an area where some amazing advances are possible, according to the medical researchers, that can eliminate this disease and save the taxpayer literally billions of dollars. 
But because PKD is something that has not generated a huge lobbying effort, does not have influential friends in Congress in key positions, PKD continues to get the short end of the stick in terms of research dollars. And yet, if there was ever an area where we ought to be directing research funds, if the medical science says we have an opportunity here to utilize these effectively and provide research, if there is ever an area that can free up funds that we can use for more research, in Parkinson's and other areas, or to help with the Medicare funding or Medicaid funding or Medicare funding, it ought to be in polycystic kidney disease, because the Government, we have agreed we are going to pay for transfusions on dialysis, we are going to pay for those out of Federal funds. And so year after year after year we pay billions of dollars to provide very costly and very difficult relief for people suffering from this disease, and yet we give them virtually nothing in terms of their research. 
As a consequence of all that, and through discussions we have had in committee with some NIH scientists and researchers, I think we are coming to a consensus here that we ought to initiate a process by which we can coordinate our research dollars in a way that it gives us an effective use of those dollars and gives us the best chance to provide the best research in the best ways. 
This amendment that I am going to offer shortly would require a comprehensive review of NIH and congressional policies and procedures for establishing priorities for research dollars. And that review has to be independent of the agency. The amendment requires that the agency contract with the Institute of Medicine, which I think is a highly respected and reputable institution, to conduct the study according to the statutory specifications, and requires a report to Congress within 6 months so that the authorizing and the appropriating committees for next year's cycle will have that information before them before they make their decisions. 
It raises critical questions about how we ought to direct research dollars, talks about how much funding that would be appropriate, and the statutory changes that will be needed to change NIH policies and procedures. 
The Institute of Medicine is particularly directed to focus on the factors and criteria used by NIH to make disease funding allocations, to focus on the process by which the funding decisions are made, the mechanisms for public input and the impact of congressional statutory directives. 
Again, as I said, Dr. Olonow, from NIH, who testified before our committee, thought that this was an appropriate way to proceed. The funding is drawn from NIH's general administrative funds. None of these funds will come from existing research dollars. This amendment is not opposed by NIH. I think it will give us a means of making wiser decisions about how we appropriate dollars in the future.

Until we hear from the other side----

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. The amendment I will offer, and I will hold offering it until such time as an agreement can be at least reached on the other side, this amendment is something that we have debated before. I think it is an important debate. I think it does not require that we make a lengthy debate because it has been discussed and debated. 
I want to make sure that each Senator is aware of a certain practice and the implications of that practice before they cast their final vote on the Parkinson's research or any other research that might involve the use of fetal tissue. The amendment says, briefly, notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the amounts subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research Act of 1997 may be expended for any research which utilizes human fetal tissues, cells, or organs obtained from a living or dead embryo or dead fetus during or after an induced abortion. The subsection does not apply to human fetal tissues, cells, or organs obtained from a spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. 
We just debated, and I believe will vote tonight or tomorrow, and certainly it will pass and I will vote for it, the provision offered by the Senator from Minnesota to increase funding for Parkinson's research. I was pleased the Senate accepted the amendment I just offered to provide a study which will give us guidance in terms of how we can direct research funds in the future. 
But on the question of Parkinson's research, it is important that we address an issue that a lot of people do not like to talk about but it is an issue that I think is relevant and one that is important, and that is that in certain research--and I believe it is very limited research, and fortunately it is research that is much more limited than it was in the past because it has not shown that much promise--the implantation of human fetal tissue has been one of the means by which researchers have attempted to address the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Now, from a practical standpoint it is important to understand that the amendment here only affects use of fetal tissue, the use of funds to provide fetal tissue research for Parkinson's disease. There are a number of other diseases, diabetes and others, that use fetal tissue research, and that is a subject for a separate time. This only applies to that particular section of the Udall bill and it simply says that funds that we will appropriate cannot be used for fetal tissue research. It does not affect research in other areas. It does not affect indirect research that affects Parkinson's. 
Frankly, I do not know that this should even be an issue in Parkinson's, and I cannot speak with scientific authority, but to the best of my knowledge fetal tissue research has held very little and is diminishing in importance in terms of Parkinson's research. 
The Parkinson's Action Network has issued a statement, and I will quote from that statement that says: 
Even those involved with fetal tissue research readily acknowledge that the result of their research will not use human fetal tissues. Current work is intended only to demonstrate the capability. Ultimately, another source of fetal material must be found. 
That is the statement from the Parkinson's Action Network. 
So we are not even talking about direct use here as a potential cure or alleviation of circumstances of Parkinson's. One of the reasons for that is that human tissue has consistently been found to be unsanitary or not fit for clinical use. 
Now, the good news is that there are other sources of tissue that have shown some promise that are not from induced abortions. There are xenografts, fetal pig tissue, that at this time and to my understanding are believed to be more useful than human tissue. 
There are human cell lines that are more promising sources of tissue than tissue derived from abortions. Genetically engineered cell research has shown significant promise. And tissue that is derived from miscarried pregnancies is now being utilized as a substitute for utilizing fetal tissue from induced abortions. 
So I want my colleagues to understand, we are not trying to impede significant research on Parkinson's from the limited amount of research that does come from fetal tissue. There are alternative means of obtaining tissue, whether it is animal tissue, whether it is human cell lines, whether genetically engineered, or whether it is actual fetal tissue, but fetal tissue obtained from miscarriages, from spontaneous abortions, which are miscarriages, but also from ectopic pregnancies. 
So there are alternatives to obtain the material necessary for this research. 
In addition, the research seems to be moving away from fetal tissue and even new tissue toward more promising areas of research in Parkinson's disease. Implanted brain stimulators work for some but obviously do not work for all. Surgical pallidotomies, proton therapy, genetic-based therapy--these are all alternatives to the fetal tissue research. 
So, therefore, just from a practical standpoint, regardless of how you feel about the ethical question, I think there is a real basis to avoid the controversy and to avoid the profound ethical questions and concerns that arise from the utilization of human fetal tissue through induced abortions. 
What are those ethical questions that we ought to be asking ourselves? Many of us in the Senate--I am included in this--either have parents, children, spouses, relatives, friends, or colleagues who have, unfortunately, incurred a neurological disease in which fetal tissue transplantation has offered some hope of treatment. So it is not a subject that we ought to lightly dismiss. 
I just outlined why I think in the area of Parkinson's research that it is really not even a major issue any more. But I think we have to address the question of the wrenching dilemma that it ought to pose--that is posed--by the issue of human tissue research. Therefore, I think we ought to be searching for a path that serves both public health needs and concerns and the questions of moral principle, a path that offers hope for breakthroughs in research, for cures, for alleviating symptoms, but a path which also shows ethical insight. 
Scientific research does not occur in a moral vacuum. I think it has to be guided by something that is more than just practically possible or feasible research. It has to be guided by some ethical considerations that I think each of us need to ask ourselves. 
In this regard, the ethical questions, I believe, are the following: 
Question No. 1: Will the use of tissue from elective abortions create an irreversible economic and an institutional bond between abortion centers and biomedical science? 
Just think for a minute. If medical research becomes dependent on widespread abortion, a vested interest would clearly be created in a substantial uninterrupted flow of human fetal tissue. Medical science would be dependent on continued legal abortion on demand. Does that create an ethical dilemma? I would argue that it does. The reason that it does is that there is no way that we could provide sufficient tissue from spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, or ectopic pregnancies because we know that if tissue transplants are the cure for diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other neurological trauma, then we are talking about between 34 million and 20 million fetuses a year necessary to supply the need for the fetal tissue to address the problem. 
So just on this basis alone, it seems that we need to look at alternative ways to generate fetal tissue without elective abortions--to look at cell cultures, use of animal tissue, and other research that I have just mentioned. We have an ethical nightmare, a potential ethical nightmare that we will face if we can't address ourselves to alternatives. 
Another question is: By what right is this fetal tissue obtained? Certainly the remains of the fetus in elective abortions are not donated in the traditional sense of the word. The fetus can't give consent. It is instead provided by the very people who have made the decision to end the life of the fetus. Can the person who ends the life be morally permitted to determine the use of the organs in the life that that person just ended?

Mr. COATS. Let me return to the question of the ethical dilemma that is posed with utilization of fetal tissue in research. There is a broad ethical question that affects all neurological research or any research that utilizes human fetal tissue. I have tried to raise some of the questions that I think ought to give all of us pause before we sign off on the use of human fetal tissue in medical research. 
Does it create an irreversible economic and institutional bond been abortion centers and biomedical science? That is a legitimate question. Because if the cure or alleviation of symptoms for neurological diseases, diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and diabetes and other neurological trauma, is dependent on utilization of human fetal tissue, then we are talking about the need to supply fetal tissue patches or pieces from up to 20 million abortions, induced abortions a year. That poses a profound ethical question. 
Second, the question is, by what right will we obtain this fetal tissue? We obtain it with the consent of the very person who has made the decision to end the life of the fetus from which the fetal tissue will be derived. So there is no such thing as consent of the human species, the human being, the human person whose life is ended to provide the fetal tissue in the name of medical science. 
And is it really possible to separate the practice of abortion from its use in biomedical research? Are researchers merely using the results of abortion, or are they dictating its practice? 
There are real concerns about how fetal tissue is derived, how it is procured. A report issued by the University of Minnesota Center for Bioethics has stated that in Sweden, `Doctors say they have obtained brain tissues with a forceps before the fetus was suctioned out of the mother. That raises the question of whether the fetus was killed by the harvesting of brain tissue or by abortion.' 
Janice Raymond, professor of women's studies and medical ethics at the University of Massachusetts, has testified that doctors are already altering the methods of abortion in order to get the tissue that they desire, and I quote from her. 
Doctors who are eager to get good tissue samples must put women at additional risk of complication by altering the methods of performing abortions and by extending the time it takes to perform the conventional abortion procedure. 
Dorie Vawter of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota has reaffirmed this observation, noting that some clinics currently alter abortion methods for tissue harvesting--slowing down the abortion procedure, reducing the pressure of the suction machine, and increasing the size of dilation instruments, all practices which place women at additional risk. 
And so in the harvesting of human tissue, the human tissue has to be at a certain condition. I talked a few moments ago about how much of this tissue is unfit for effective use in Parkinson's research or other neurological research. And now we have testimony of people who are altering the procedures of obtaining the human fetal tissue so that the human fetal tissue is in a better condition for this research. But in doing so they place the health of the woman who is carrying the child, from whom the fetal tissue is derived, at greater health risk. 
And then I think we have to ask probably the most difficult of questions, and that is, are we encouraging abortion by covering it with a veneer of compassion? 
Dr. Kathleen Nolan, formerly of the Hastings Center, writes, 
Lifesaving cures resulting from the use of cadaveric material might make abortion, and fetal death, seem less tragic. Enhancing abortion's image could thus be expected to undermine efforts to make it as little needed and little done procedure as possible. 
This is a very real concern because often people come up to me and say: Why do you offer amendments? Why do you think that utilization of fetal tissue should be restricted to noninduced abortions, because it does so much good, it holds so much potential. 
Look at the ethical question involved. Is taking a life, is killing a fetus in order to obtain material that is useful in providing research which offers promising health benefits to individuals, is that not one of the most profound ethical and moral questions that we have to face? 
And so I think when we look at a question like this, we clearly have to understand, as Stephen Post said,  
Ultimately, it is the specter of a society whose medical institutions are inextricably bound up with elective abortion and whose people come to believe that for their own health they have every right to feed off the unborn, that gives pause. 
Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota expresses these concerns in another way. 
This is the ultimate issue of generational justice. You're not just asking for the pocketbooks of the young--you're asking for their body parts. 
Now, fortunately, Madam President, we have alternatives available to us. I have listed those alternatives. In the case of Parkinson's, and that is the issue we are facing here--we will address the other issue at another time--but in the case of Parkinson's research, we are learning that fetal tissue research is of diminishing importance and of diminishing effectiveness. 
We are learning that there are more viable alternatives that hold far greater benefit and hope for breakthroughs in treating Parkinson's than fetal tissue. And so while I think it is appropriate that we are focusing on increasing funds for research in Parkinson's, I believe it is also appropriate that we place this most limited of restrictions on this research, both for practical reasons because it offers very little hope of any research breakthroughs and because this tissue can be obtained by other alternatives without taking human life, without inducing abortions. Fetal tissue cells from human fetuses can be obtained through miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies, but the other forms of research, the xenografts from animal tissue, which are now being found to be more useful than human tissue, human cell lines, genetically engineered cells, and then all the other more promising means of research in Parkinson's, I think allow us to say that at least in this area we will not pursue and we do not need to pursue the utilization of human fetal tissue.

Mr. COATS. First of all, I wish to associate myself strongly with the remarks of the Senator from Louisiana and Rhode Island and the Senator from New York relative to entitlement reform. I spoke at length on it yesterday, and I will not repeat all those remarks. It was with great sadness and disappointment we came what I think is as close as we have ever come in this Congress to addressing the fundamental reforms, structural reforms that need to take place in our entitlement programs, particularly Medicare, if we are going to ensure the long-term viability of that program, which I think we are all committed to do, and if we are going to prevent a crisis situation in which we will not act perhaps in a rational, reasonable manner but address it under the threat of massive underpayment or massive deficit in that program. 
It is interesting to me that in the Chamber just a moment ago were two Republicans and two Democrats, probably covering the ideological spectrum within our respective parties, all speaking in favor of entitlement reform. So I am hopeful that we are at least moving in the right direction. The Senator from New York said that even though we expected a firestorm of political opposition, it wasn't heard. It wasn't heard because the American people need to be given more credit for understanding the nature of the problem and the solutions to the problem than we give them credit for. 
There might have been a time politically when retribution would have been rendered across the spectrum for anybody who even breathed the idea that we ought to change Medicare. But today even senior citizens understand that this very important program cannot maintain its viability unless some reasonable changes are made, structural changes are made, in the current program in the way it is currently operated. Younger people understand, and if you ask them today whether or not they think there will be a viable Medicare Program for them when they retire, an alarmingly high percentage say, no, I don't; I think the payroll taxes that are being extracted from my paycheck are going into a fund and I will never see the benefits. 
So I share the disappointment of our Members in terms of coming so close and yet not succeeding at this important time. I made the point yesterday that during difficult economic times, when unemployment is high and deficits are running high, we say we can't make these changes now because it will result in too much economic dislocation. Here we have the best of times. We 
have never had a more favorable time economically and politically in which to address these questions. Our economy is humming along at a rate that none of us anticipated, pouring revenues into Washington--which we are giving some back with this tax cut--which were reducing the deficit, which is what we need to do. We are balancing the budget. We are the recipients of very good economic fortunes. And we have in place politically an administration that doesn't have to stand for reelection, a Congress that has already gone on record in support of entitlement reform. It just seems as if all the political stars and economic stars are lined up and that this is the moment. 
I hope these good times last. I hope these good political stars continue to line up in a way that we can accomplish this. But I think those who have experienced some years of history understand that the good times do not always last, that we will be facing different circumstances in the future, and we may not have the pieces in place to accomplish this. We do not need another commission. The Senator from Louisiana is absolutely correct. We have had commissions. We have had studies. We have more information than we know what to do with. We have educated the American people. The seniors understand. The young people understand. Everybody seems to understand. Unfortunately, we always come down to the point of not now; let's do it after the next election. Let's get past this next period of time. That is, indeed, unfortunate. 
Today I want to focus the remainder of my remarks, and they will be brief, on the continuing effort to bring tax equity to families. This is a process that began in the 1980's. I was pleased to be a part of that, leading the effort in the House of Representatives along with my colleague Jack Kemp in pushing for family tax relief. We were able to double the personal exemption, the first major adjustment in the amount of tax relief that families get for raising children since the inception of the dependents deduction in 1948. We continue that now with this bill. I introduced the child tax credit in the Senate in 1992 as part of my families first legislation. I was joined by then Congressman Rod Grams, now Senator Grams from Minnesota. As he was my compatriot in this in the House of Representatives, he has continued that leadership in the Senate. I am pleased to have worked with him in that effort. This is a culmination of a long effort to readdress the imbalance that exists within the Tax Code in terms of family tax relief. 
Many people have fought for it, and I commend those who have worked so hard to achieve this. A disproportionate share of the tax burden on families has been a problem in both good economic times and bad economic times. It has increased over the decades even as the cost of raising children has increased. The Tax Code has been a symbol in the past of public indifference to the challenge to families, and this tax measure today is a symbol that our thinking and our actions are finally changing. Clearly we are beginning to understand that a dollar spent by families is far more helpful to children and compassionate than any dollar spent by the Federal Government. 
In 1997, Americans will work until the middle of May just to earn enough to pay their tax bill. Most families must have both parents working, one to provide for the family, one to pay taxes to the Government. In fact, families today spend more in taxes than they do on food, clothing, and shelter combined. The evidence is overwhelming. The facts are no longer contestable. 
The answer is to return public funds to the people and not to funnel them through the Government. The child tax credit is a tangible achievement for the people of every State. In my State of Indiana, the $500 child tax credit will give over 850,000 Hoosier families representing 1.1 million Hoosier children an average of over $80 a month extra money for family income. I am as proud, I think, as anything else that I have done in this body, to be a part of this effort to restore equity to families, to give them the ability to retain more of their hard-earned dollars to help raise their children and pay for the costs of raising those children. It is the most immediate practical form of compassion I can imagine, allowing them to spend their own money on their own needs. 
Mr. President, I have walked the Halls of Congress for nearly 20 years, and I have watched the high-powered lobbyists gain funds for special interests and for powerful groups. There have been those who have stood up over the years for the interests of families. 
But, thankfully, over time, those numbers have changed. Today they include the leadership of Congress in both parties. The largest portion of relief in this tax bill, 56.2 percent, goes to families, and that is an achievement in which we can all take pride. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, to privatize religious belief is to trivialize it. When we treat religion as purely personal--irrelevant to the way we live our lives and write our laws--this is not neutrality to religion, it is hostility to religion. The reason is simple: because faith is more than an internal belief, it is a guide to external conduct. And for religious liberty to have any meaning, government and business must accommodate that conduct, within the bounds of reason and order. Consider one case: 
Ms. Jones, a line worker at Bigco Enterprises approaches her supervisor with a problem: According to her religion, she may not work on Sunday. Ms. Jones will work any other day--including Saturday evenings--without extra pay. But the mandate of her religion is absolute. If given the choice of working on Sunday or losing her job, Ms. Jones will have to resign or risk being fired. The supervisor explains that Bigco has a random shift-assignment policy which requires that every employee work the assigned shift or find a replacement worker. Unable to find a replacement worker, Ms. Jones misses two Sundays, and is fired. 
Mr. President, presumably, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of her religion, would provide Ms. Jones some recourse. But that is not necessarily the case. 
Since 1972, title VII has required an employer to make an accommodation `unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship.' In a case such as the one described above, Mr. Jones' religious practice would not have to be accommodated, and Bigco would likely not be liable since attempting to find a replacement worker for Jones would cause Bigco to `bear more than a de minimis cost'. 
Under current law, Ms. Jones' religious observance would constitute an undue hardship, and Bigco would have no further obligation to Ms. Jones. 
Over 60 percent of Americans consider themselves to be religious, yet, Ms. Jones' predicament is all too common in the United States. Employees who engage in seemingly common religious observances such as the Sabbath are often faced with the difficulty of breaking an employer's rule or violating a religious tenet. 
As Justice Marshall explained in his dissent in the Hardison case, under the de minimis standard which the courts have adopted in religious accommodation cases, an employer `need not grant even the most minor special privilege to religious observers to enable them to follow their faith.' He continues: `As a question of social policy, this result is deeply troubling, for a society that truly values pluralism cannot compel aderents of minority religions to make the cruel choice of surrendering their religion or their job.' 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kerry in introducing the Workplace Religious Freedom Act to addresses this issue head-on. The goal of the act is to restore the original intent of title VII by extending to religious observers the same level of protection afforded others under Federal civil rights laws. 
The act accomplishes this goal principally by applying the same standard for undue hardship to religious observance cases as are already applied in other Federal civil rights actions, such as those under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Thus under this legislation, the term undue hardship is defined as an action requiring `significant difficulty or expense'. 
Our bill takes into account a number of factors, including: First the cost of the accommodation as determined by the costs of lost productivity and of retraining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another; second the size of the employer; third the number of employees who require the accommodation and; fourth for an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. 
The bill also provides a number of safeguards for the employer. For example, 
an employer is not required to provide an accommodation which will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the job nor is an employer required to pay premium wages or additional benefits to employees requesting the accommodation if the change in schedule is instituted specifically to accommodate an employee's religious observance or practice. 
The Workplace Religious Freedom Act is an important step toward restoring the original intent of title VII. Though we know that only a minority of employers refuse to make reasonable accommodations for employees to observe the Sabbath or other Holy days, the fact of the matter is that no worker in America should be forced to choose between a job and violating deeply held religious tenets. Religious discrimination in America must not be tolerated. It should be treated as seriously as any other form of discrimination. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding us that the best and oldest tradition of America is religious accommodation without coercion. We have no established religion in this country, and do not want one. But we must recognize and respect the important role of religion in our society. Values that come from religious faith enrich our common life. As a society, we must continue to guarantee that religious liberty. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce for Independence Act, bipartisan legislation designed to help poor and working-poor Americans build the productive assets they need to get out of poverty and invest in their future. 
Just as people can't borrow their way out of debt, they can't spend their way out of poverty. To move forward, America's struggling families need assets. For assets are `hope in concrete form.' While our Nation has wisely recognized this fact for our middle- and upper-income families by subsidizing, through the Tax Code, the acquisition of homes and retirement accounts, we have not extended these very sensible policies to our lower-income citizens. In fact, they are often penalized if they try to save. 
My legislation will change that, and set them on a path to economic independence. And, by increasing our national savings rate, it will help set America on a path to greater productivity and prosperity. I truly believe that IDA's can be to the 21st century what the Homestead Act was to the 19th and what the GI Bill was to the 20th--an investment in the common genius of the American people. The truth, Mr. President, is that we have spent billions on the poor, but we have rarely invested in them. And I say emphatically that IDA's are not a give-away--they are an investment. 
The Assets for Independence Act authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to establish community-based Individual Development Account [IDA] programs throughout the country. IDA's are matched savings accounts that can be used by low-income people to acquire a first home, a small business or post-secondary education or training. To help the poor save and to encourage work, their earned income would be matched by federal, non-federal, and private dollars. All payments would go directly to the third-party vendors (for example, directly to the mortgage company for people using their IDA to buy their first home) and, like IRA's, there would be harsh penalties for misuse. Community-based non-profit organizations would have to compete and raise money to be an IDA demonstration site. The legislation authorizes $25 million a year for 4 years for the demonstration. 
Mr. President, IDA's are not new to America. In fact, they're spreading rapidly; in part as a result of legislation I proposed, and the Congress passed, last year in connection with the welfare reform bill. 
Over 40 private, community-based IDA's programs are operating around the country. I am pleased to say that one of the oldest and most successful IDA programs in the country, at Eastside Community Investments, is located in Indianapolis. 
Fourteen States have already included IDA's in their State welfare reform plans, as permitted by the passage of last year's legislation. 
Twenty States have sponsored their own IDA programs, some through refundable tax credits, others through direct appropriation. For example, Pennsylvania has allocated $1.25 million for IDA's through a `Family Savings Accounts' program for low-income families. 
Over 200 community-based groups in 43 States signified their intention to develop IDA's in response to a large, privately-funded IDA demonstration, slated to begin later this summer. 
When I talk about IDA's, people often say to me that the poor cannot save. Well they're wrong. The poor can and do save. As of 1995, some 171,000 low-income families saved more than $250 million through community development credit unions in many of America's poorest neighborhoods. Also, I believe that the savings rate of the poor will rise tremendously once we start supporting saving, both institutionally and culturally. And finally, I doubt that all this IDA activity in the country would be going on--all the millions of dollars being committed by major foundations, corporations, and States to IDA's--if there wasn't a core belief in the ability and willingness of the poor to save for long-term, productive assets. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. Just as the private sector and several State have invested in America's poor through IDA's, we--the Federal Government should invest too. Our commitment to IDA's could leverage millions more in private and State contributions--and thereby help move millions of hardworking low-income families from poverty to economic independence.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, I don't believe I will take all 15 minutes. 
I want to express, however, the reason I am voting against this budget agreement. When the budget resolution came before the floor of the Senate initially, I voted against it because it did not contain the entitlement reforms--the structural reforms that I felt were absolutely necessary if we are ever going to have a sustained, consistent effort at balancing our budget. Clearly, we all know that the entitlements--the mandatory spending--have not been structurally reformed for a long, long time, and we are on a collision course with their ability to meet the demands on those funds in the future. Some changes were made in this bill. I want to talk about those in a minute. But they were not the structural reforms. 
Then when the budget reconciliation bill came before the Senate, I supported the budget reconciliation bill because the Senate had the courage to stand up to the plate and address the need for entitlement reforms. I doubt that there is a Member of this Congress, House or Senate, or anyone else who has paid attention to this issue, that doesn't recognize that this is something that we have to do. We are on a collision course with bankruptcy for Medicare. 
We hear all of this wonderful talk about preserving Medicare for the benefit of our elderly. Yet, the quality of Medicare services continue to decline because we continue to impose restraints and restrictions on the providers, and it squeezes the quality of care. And we fail to have the will to step up to the plate and deliver any kind of structural reform in the program--even reform that takes place well into the next century. The Senate addressed that issue. The Senate by a fairly substantial vote passed legislation which would begin that process of structural reform. So I supported the bill on that basis, hoping that it would survive conference. Due to a number of factors which I will talk about, it didn't survive. And it is back here now without those reforms. 
All the wonderful promises and rhetoric about addressing the Medicare problem is more of the same that we have been promising for the last several budget resolutions, most of which has not come to fruition. 
So I approach this conference spending bill with a sense of sadness and feeling of resignation--a sense of sadness because I know that the Senator from New Mexico and others who have been involved in this process have worked very, very hard to put together a bill which moves us toward a balanced budget. They have incorporated a number of provisions in here which I believe are important provisions, and provisions which I support; but a sense of sadness because we have dropped in the negotiations what I think were the most important parts of this budget reconciliation bill--the structural reforms and entitlements. 
It is entitlements that are eating up our revenues. It is the entitlements, were it not for a booming economy which is pouring revenues into our coffers for the present time--it is the entitlements which would be squeezing other aspects of the budget, whether you are for education, or roads or safe water, or environmental issues, or a whole number of other things. Those are being squeezed because we don't have the political will and courage to address the entitlements. 
It is resignation that I feel because lasting structural reform of Government spending seems to be beyond the ability of the Congress and the executive branch. 
The measure before us today is significant not for what it contains but for what it does not contain--commitment to fundamental institutional change. And that failure is most obvious, as I have said, when we look at the entitlement parts of this bill. 
Here, for whatever reason--probably a lack of political will--we have dropped the three measures which maybe signaled the best hope of future ability to contain entitlement growth. Instead, we have what is estimated as a $115 billion reduction in Medicare spending, but this is an evasion, not a reform, because these projected savings are achieved by the typical way we have done this: decreasing payments to providers. It has been tried over and over again, and it has failed. Costs have continued to rise under reduced payment schemes while the quality of care has decreased. 
The plan also shifts the home health care program, the fastest growing part of Medicare, from Medicare part A to part B. That is a shift, at taxpayer expense, by the way, that simply delays the overall failure of this program by not reforming its faults but simply making it sustainable. In addition, the measure drops the Senate provisions that would have set the stage for future reforms, measures that, as I said, were adopted as a result of the leadership of Senator Gramm, who offered the amendment, and support on a bipartisan basis--Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and others--for these reforms. The Senate bit the bullet. The Senate exercised the political will. The Senate put itself out on a limb only to see all of these reforms dropped in these negotiations. 
Means testing provision dropped, the increase, very gradual increase in eligibility from 65 to 67 that would not affect anybody 46 years of age and older, and the increase in copayments for home health care service dropped, all killed, and along with that any hope for meaningful reform. 
The President bears some of this responsibility, a lot of this responsibility, because we all know that we cannot accomplish this without Presidential leadership, and that leadership was tepid at best. There was no sustained active involvement on the part of the executive branch and the President to bring about these reforms. And support from the House, not this body, but support from the House was weak, and I regret that. It falls on the shoulders of both parties. 
Left unchecked, CBO projects that Medicare spending will explode to $470 billion a year by the year 2007, representing an average annual increase of 8 percent over the next 10 years. This is a growth rate of nearly double the estimated growth of the overall economy for the same period. In the period from 2010 to 2030, when 80 million baby boomers move into retirement, Medicare's expenses are expected to surge to 14 percent of our gross domestic product as compared with 2.5 today. This cannot be sustained. This is a train coming down the track headed for a wreck, and yet time after time after time, as we are faced with the prospect of that train wreck, we blink. We pass it off to the next Congress and the next Congress, and we defer and pass that debt off to future generations. 
The $115 billion in promised reduced payments does nothing to avert this long-term disaster. By dropping the reforms passed by the Senate, budget negotiators have brought the looming crisis one step closer to reality. And just yesterday in the Washington Post, there was an article entitled, in fact, `Billions Wasted, Medicare Audit Says.' The article opens by stating that nearly 40 percent of the home health care services provided to frail elderly Americans under the Medicare Program are unjustified either because the service is not necessary or the agency administering the care is not sanctioned to do so or the person is not covered--40 percent. I think the figure was $23 billion a year in fraud and waste and abuse of one part of the Medicare system. 
We had a provision in the bill that began to address the problem, and we passed on it. We could not even turn to seniors and say that the program which benefits you, home health care--and I used that for my father when he was home in need of that health care--the program that benefits you is so fraught with waste and abuse it is jeopardizing the entire Medicare system. And yet, the Congress refuses to even impose the most minimal of corrections to try to address that problem. 
So what do we offer our seniors? A so-called bipartisan commission to study the problem. Madam President, there is nothing left to study. We have studied this thing to death. The problem is not a lack of knowledge. It is a lack of political will. Confronting the Medicare crisis will take political courage and it will take sacrifice. But these values, which should come easier in a time of economic growth and prosperity, are absent in the spending plan. That is to say nothing about Social Security. That is another problem that we don't even touch here and we also need to address. 
All of this, as I said, is deeply disturbing, but then when you add to that a new entitlement program, a $24 billion health care entitlement, paid for with a tax hike on cigarettes and tobacco, you compound the problem--not because we do not need a health care program for children; we do, but because this one was designed with no rational basis. It was created without an assessment of the need. The level of funding was arbitrary. We were throwing figures around here--how much can we add? How much can we subtract? Pulling figures out of thin air in a mindless bidding war rather than having an adult policy debate. 
We are creating in this measure future entitlement problems that we cannot even imagine because we have not taken the pains to consider those problems. 
I am not speaking against the need for health care for children. I am saying let us determine what the need is and tailor a program that addresses the specific need without just throwing a new entitlement program in place that will probably go the way of all other entitlement programs and that will grow beyond our means to check it, and we will not be able to put reforms in that either. 
What is absent from this agreement is any type of fundamental, lasting structural reform in our Government and its spending. That reform is now possible because of the strength of our economy. This is when we ought to be putting these reforms in place. 
We always hear that we cannot make structural reforms during times of economic slowdown, because that would have too much negative impact on our economy. And now we hear the argument that we cannot make reforms during economic prosperity because it is too difficult, because a strong economy signals to us that we do not need to make reforms. We will just reap the benefits of the new revenues that are coming in. And so when the economy is down, we cannot do it because it hurts the economy, and when the economy is doing well, we say we do not need to do it; there is no sense of urgency anymore. 
Our entitlement crisis is lurking around the corner, just below the surface of this strong economy. The same irrational and bloated bureaucracies that choke our economy in hard times hide in the shadows of economic boom because this legislation does nothing to reform and limit the Federal Government. 
Sooner or later the economy is going to slow. I wish it would not, but it will. And when it does, the reckoning will be even more severe. We have squandered a unique opportunity--a President who is not running again, a Congress led by Republicans who are willing to walk out on a limb again for entitlement reform, who will support a President if he would just provide leadership on entitlement reform, a prosperous economy where people are at work, revenues coming in. 
Is there ever going to be a better time to bring entitlement reform to our budget process? I doubt it. And yet we are squandering this marvelous opportunity to make changes now that will be incremental and small in nature but will provide great dividends and great benefits for the future. Instead, in the interest of political expediency, we postpone those tough decisions to a future Congress, to future generations, and we look myopically at the immediate election consequences, what we perceive them to be. I do not believe they are there. I think people are looking for politicians who will exercise political will, make the tough decision, step up and do what is right, and I think they will be rewarded in the polls. Instead, we say let us pass on this one more time. 
We will never have a better moment. We will never have a better opportunity. We will never be in a position where we are 3 years out from a general election, more than a year out from the next off-term election, with an Executive who does not ever have to stand for election again in his life, with a Senate that has already made the decision to go out on the limb. We will never be in a better position, and yet we have squandered this moment. 
For that reason, for all of the hard work that the Senator from New Mexico and others have put in this agreement, for all of the benefits in this agreement and the positive things in this agreement, I cannot support this resolution, because my litmus test, as I stated when I voted against the budget resolution and for the budget reconciliation, included entitlement reforms. But now, because they have been drawn out, that litmus test was not met. 
That is a minimal litmus test. I was willing to accept minimal reforms, anything, anything that moved us in a path of structural reform, addressing a problem that we know is going to impact negatively on the people of this country and the economy of this country. We know it passes on debt to future generations. We know it places our elderly people in a precarious position for the future of Medicare. And yet at this golden time, which may not come again, for political expediency or whatever reason--I wasn't in the budget negotiations--we once again pass, we once again take a powder on this and say we will do it another time; let's form a commission; let's study it some more; let's have some more recommendations. 
How many studies, recommendations and conditions do we have to put in place to keep telling us what we already know? 
So, Madam President, I know I am a skunk at the party here, the celebration for the passage of this so-called balanced budget agreement, and I hope it does balance the budget, and it may, mostly, I think, not because of new spending we put in place but because the economy is roaring along and pouring money into the coffers of the Government. I wish we could get more of that money back to the people who have earned that money. Instead, we are creating new entitlements. We passed on the opportunity to reform existing entitlements, and I just regret that very much. 
So I may be a lonely voice in this vote, but I cannot for the reasons I have stated support this resolution. 
I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

Mr. COATS. I want to take just a few moments to put something in the Record that has not really been high profiled recently but which is I believe important. 
I picked up the Washington Post earlier this week and was reading through the Post, and in there was a small story detailing what the President's press secretary, Mike McCurry, had to say about an earlier statement made by the White House relative to the law which governs the service in the military of people with homosexual persuasion. 
The administration had issued the comment in response to some court rulings that they thought that the law was working as intended. And then Mr. McCurry, after admitted pressure from the gay rights lobby, issued a clarification which changed the response or at least was intended to change the response. I quote from the Washington Post article which said: 
After protests from gay rights groups, McCurry yesterday said that contrary to an earlier statement, the Clinton administration does have concerns about how its [so-called] `don't ask, don't tell' policy [`so-called' is my emphasis] on homosexuality is being enforced in the military. 
First of all, let me state that this, the current policy which is described by many as a `don't-ask, don't-tell policy,' is not descriptive of the particular policy. Therefore, I think it is important that we understand that what we are dealing with here is a law enacted by this Congress on a bipartisan basis, signed into law by the current President of the United States, and not subject to different interpretations but subject to exactly what is printed in the statute. 
Mr. McCurry needs to understand and the White House needs to understand that the prohibition against homosexuals serving in the military is a statutory requirement that was passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed into law by the President, his President. 
The true test of whether the Department of Defense is faithfully executing the law is whether those who have engaged in or who have a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct are being separated from military service. That is the statute. That is the intent of the statute. That is the intent of the Congress, as enacted into statutory language and signed by the President. 
And that standard is that those who have engaged in or have a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct find themselves at a great inconsistency with longstanding military policy and are therefore eligible and should be separated from military service. That is the law of the land. 
Just a little bit of history. 
In January 1993, just days after his inauguration, President Clinton announced his intent to reverse the military's longstanding prohibition against homosexuals serving in the Armed Forces. That decision was uniformly opposed by our military commanders, and decisively overturned by the Congress after months of careful deliberation. 
Just to reiterate here, the President, very shortly after taking office, reversed longstanding military policy, and even though the President serves in his constitutional capacity as Commander in Chief, the leaders of our military unanimously opposed, publicly opposed the President's position saying that it would undermine morale, undermine the cohesiveness, undermine the very essence of what the military was designed to do. 
The Congress' consensus--after very considerable examination, hearings and debate--the Congress' consensus on the issue was clear, it was bipartisan, and it was broad. And the President ultimately signed a statutory prohibition against homosexuals serving in the military. He signed that into law. 
The law clearly sustained the Department of Defense longstanding policy and was based on several key findings of fact by the Congress. Those findings of fact are also law. And I would like to repeat those so that there is no confusion in this administration about either what the intent of Congress was or what the law was that passed the Congress and was signed by the President and now is operative. 
Let me just state some of these key findings.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a true Hoosier hero, Mr. Darrell Colson of Indianapolis. On July 15, 1997, Mr. Colson performed a heroic act. While getting ready to leave his apartment complex pool, he noticed that his neighbor, Orian Williams, who moments earlier was swimming laps, was now drowning at the bottom of the pool. After an attempt by Kim Williams, his fiance, to rescue the young woman, Mr. Colson dove into the water and pulled Ms. Williams to safety. Once he was able to remove her from the water, Darrell Colson and Kim Williams performed CPR until the rescue team arrived. Orian Williams, who by then was in a coma, was rushed to a nearby community hospital where she regained consciousness after receiving medical treatment. 
This is a remarkable act, by a remarkable individual. However, what makes Ms. Williams' rescue truly amazing is that Mr. Colson is a paraplegic. Four years ago, Mr. Colson suffered a tragic accident when he fell 40 feet from a tree; he is now confined to a wheelchair. To save Ms. Williams, Darrell Colson maneuvered his wheelchair to the pool, dove in, held onto her with one arm and used the other to swim her to the surface. Despite his condition, Mr. Colson found the courage to risk his own life for a fellow human being. Mr. Colson may not think of himself as special, but he is a hero to both Orian Williams and to all of us who look to his selfless example for inspiration. 
I initiated the Hoosier Hero program in 1991 to recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to Indiana life, while at the same time serving as an inspirational example to the entire Nation. I cannot think of a more inspirational display of courage than saving the life of another individual. Last week, Mr. President, I was pleased to officially recognize Mr. Colson as a true Hoosier hero and awarded him a Hoosier Hero plaque. 
Mr. Colson never expected to save a life that day while he was relaxing at the pool. Yet, he demonstrated how we all need to be prepared if we are called upon to help others. 
Today I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Darrell Colson, whose actions not only saved a life but demonstrated extraordinary bravery and courage. I challenge others to follow the example of Darrell Colson and other heroes in our communities. They ask for no recognition, and no reward. For Darrell Colson, he just wanted to see Orian Williams awaken from her coma and walk out of the hospital. Fortunately, he got his wish, but also the recognition of a grateful community.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to highlight my particular support for one provision in the committee report for this bill and express my concern with proposed Food and Drug Administration rulemaking that would adversely effect asthma patients. 
First, I'd like to note my own personal interest in the issue. My own children suffer from asthma and I appreciate only too well the impact of this condition on children and their families. As a result, I strongly support efforts to ensure that asthmatics have access to the safest and most effective treatment. 
The agency's recent actions, however, suggest that remote, even hypothetical environmental concerns might take precedence over the direct concerns for the lives and health of America's substantial asthmatic population. In March of this year, the agency issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the criteria by which it would ban certain CFC-propelled metered-dose inhalers [MDI's] from sale in this country. The proposal was apparently developed in response to concerns about ozone depletion. 
But this ozone depletion is already subject to international treaty provisions of the Montreal protocol that ensure the timely removal of products using CFC's. These medical devices are covered by those provisions, even though they only contribute a fraction of 1 percent of the overall atmospheric chlorine that threatens the ozone. Now the agency proposes to speed up the ban on those products in pursuit of some environmental gain--but at the risk of patients with asthma. 
There is currently only one MDI, of approximately 70, that is not propelled by CFC's. Removing any or all of these products too early may threaten the health of some patients, particularly the increasing number of American children with asthma. How will the agency address a situation where a CFC-free product with an active ingredient is not labeled for children when the proposed rule would remove from the market a CFC-propelled product with the same ingredient that is labeled for children? How is the health of those children promoted through such a policy? Why is the agency considering removing otherwise legal products from the market, products proven to be beneficial for children, at a time when it laments the lack of adequately labeled products for children? And further, how are children, health care costs, and the Federal budget benefited by this bureaucratically created monopoly? 
If the agency believes that hypothetical environmental concerns can justify speeding up an international treaty that attempts to accommodate the health of these 5 million children with asthma, then I urge them to justify that position before the relevant committees of Congress. In the meantime, I urge the FDA to carefully consider the merits of the rulemaking they are proposing and whether alternative approaches might better serve the health of America's asthmatic children.

Mr. COATS. I do not want to be oversolicitous here, but I think anybody watching understands the difficulty of the majority leader in trying to schedule issues for the Senate to debate. But I just want to say that the majority leader has gone out of his way to give us a family-friendly schedule and some certainty in our schedule by the way he has scheduled issues, by the way he has scheduled votes with a certainty of votes and provided Members an opportunity to go home and have dinner with their families, albeit a somewhat late dinner, but we are used to late dinners. 
I just think this is an example of the difficulty of doing what he is doing. But he is doing a terrific job of it. I appreciate that. I might have considered staying in the Senate if I had known it was going to be this family-friendly.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me yield myself 4 minutes, and then advise me when that 4 minutes is up. 
First of all, I want to tell the Senator from Wisconsin that those of us on the Armed Services Committee understand and, in fact, have raised many of the same questions that he has raised. These are legitimate questions to raise in terms of where we are going with our tactical air for the future, what the cost is going to be, what the need is, assessment and so forth. In fact, as chairman of the Airland Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, we held two hearings wherein we brought experts from the Department of Defense and outside the Department of Defense to come in and answer some of the very questions--in fact, all of the very questions--that the Senator from Wisconsin proposes here this morning. 
Because we share that concern, we know that unless we can intelligently decide on how we budget for the future, if we concentrate too much effort in the tactical air modernization category, we will be shorting other categories, because it looks like we are going to, for some time in the future, have a pretty fixed cost in terms of what we are spending for defense. 
Many of the questions that were asked by the Senator from Wisconsin were posited to those who came before our committee, and we have had personal discussions with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of the Navy, and others on this very question. 
As the Senator stated, the Department has just concluded a major study called the Quadrennial Defense Review, and as a result of that, the Secretary of Defense, former Senator Cohen, 
now Secretary Cohen, recommended very significant changes to the tactical air. He called for a significant reduction in the amount of F-22 buys, from 448 planes to 339. Even more, for the F-18E/F, from 1,000 to 548--about a 50 percent reduction, and then a significant reduction and decrease of the joint strike fighter. 
Now, in addition to that, the Secretary acknowledged that a process that was initiated by Senator Lieberman and myself, with the support of Senator McCain and then-Senator Cohen and others, acknowledged that we are waiting for the review of the National Defense Panel, which is an outside group of experts which will give us a separate assessment from the Department of Defense in terms of this question and a number of other questions. It is a look into the future in terms of what we need, all throughout our defense posture and structure, but particularly in relationship to our tactical air needs. 
This report for the National Defense Panel will be forthcoming around December 15, and the committee awaits that with great anticipation. We are working hand in hand with the Secretary of Defense, with the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, with the National Defense Panel, through the committee efforts, to try to address the very questions that the Senator from Wisconsin raised. 
The reason why we object to this particular amendment at this particular time is that if we do a short-term study on the termination, recommending the termination of one of three programs, we place any one of those three in jeopardy. It may be that the National Defense Panel, the Secretary of Defense, the future analysis will conclude a different kind of a mix or moving forward with a different balance in order to achieve the cost savings. 
If we go forward and precipitously cancel one of those programs, we put one of our services in great jeopardy. If we cancel F-22 on a short-term analysis, we leave the Air Force naked in terms of providing for tactical air defenses for the future. If we cancel F/A-18E/F, we leave the Navy--who made a decision not to go forward immediately--we leave them, as we are retiring F-14's, without carrier capability with the F/A-18E/F. If we cancel joint strike fighters, we leave the Marine Corps totally without resources for the future because they are betting their whole future on JSF's. 
It would be an egregious mistake at this time to, within a 60-day period of time, require the Secretary to do something that they have spent months and months and months of analysis on, then requiring additional months of analysis to come up with that conclusion. 
I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me try to wrap up quickly in 2 minutes here for those Senators who are listening. 
The Senator from Wisconsin says that essentially makes the argument that a decision has to be made now regarding the future of tactical air purchases that will provide air defense security for the United States for 15 to 20 years in the future. He said we need a recommendation. He said we need a recommendation now as to what that decision ought to be. He says we are trying to have it all. 
Those arguments are based on the situation as it existed before the Quadrennial Defense Review. The QDR was reported and the Secretary of Defense, former Senator Cohen, certified that changes needed to be made along the lines of what the Senator was stating, except instead of saying `cancel one,' the Secretary said we need to dramatically reduce the amount. The threat isn't such that we need the same amount as we formerly had. That is going to save a very significant amount of money. But a balanced approach allows us to address the needs of Marine tactical air, Navy tactical air and Air Force tactical air. 
If you go forward and cancel one of those, one of those services is going to be left naked, without adequate tactical air. So the balanced approach that dramatically reduces the number of F-18's, the number of F-22's, and the joint strike fighter number, is the approach they want to take. 
Second, the final decision hasn't been made. The QDR report is 4 years. The panel will look out into the future and give us more information on that decision. Secretary Cohen has only been there 6 months; give him time to work the process. We are aware of this problem. As chairman of the Air-Land Committee, we have held hearings. We deny that we have put severe cost caps on the F-22. So we have already taken that action. 
So I urge our Members to support the efforts of the committee in recognizing the problem and going forward and addressing it, but not in the draconian way the Senator from Wisconsin advocated. 
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, the Senator from Wisconsin has raised legitimate questions about the cost of future tactical air purchases. The Senate Armed Services Committee has raised these questions repeatedly with the Department of Defense, holding hearings, and received a great deal of testimony. The Secretary of Defense, former Senator Bill Cohen, has recommended a balanced approach by dramatically reducing the number of planes purchased for each of the three categories--F-18E/F, joint strike fighter, and the F-22. 
No final decision has been made. The committee has put severe cost constraints on engineering, manufacturing and development for the F-22. We are working on this problem. We have a national defense panel that will report to us in December. To make a precipitous decision, or even a precipitous recommendation, of canceling one of those programs puts one, either the joint strike fighter, F-22, or F-18E/F, in jeopardy. It leaves the services in jeopardy. If you cancel one, you either leave the Navy, Marines, or Air Force naked without tactical air capability they need for the future. 
I don't think now is the time to take this approach. I think we will be making these decisions over the next several months, but we need to rely on the Secretary and others and the bipartisan recommendation of the Armed Services Committee before moving on this. So I recommend a vote against the Feingold amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arkansas has mentioned, we have been discussing this not only with each other but with other Members who have an interest in this particular subject. We think it makes a lot of sense on our side. 
The Air Force has specified in testimony before us and in a public statement that they believe, with the adjustments that Senator Cohen has made and the QDR has made in terms of the total number of planes to be built, they can meet the cost projection. It makes a great deal of sense, I think, for the Congress to say we encourage you very, very strongly--in fact, we will put language in to give that encouragement--to meet that cost. 
If we are going to have a viable tactical modernization program in the future, given the realities of the budget that we have to deal with our entire defense structure, we have to set realistic cost caps on how much we will spend. If we don't do that, we will run into problems that we have run into before, as in B-2 and other modernization programs, and we jeopardize the entire tactical air modernization program as well as funding for other aspects of our national security. 
I think this makes perfect sense because we have something here that simply ratifies what the Air Force has said they can already do. They have assessed this. They said they can do it. They are working with a contractor to work out an agreement to do this. We are saying, `Amen. This is what you need to do and we will urge you and support you in this effort.' 
I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his amendment. We have worked together, and I believe there is agreement across the aisle that we ought to go forward with this. I think we should do just that.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not intend to talk any longer than necessary, until we get a signal that we are ready to go to final passage. I don't want to hold anything up. I know a lot of people have planes to catch and commitments to make, and are very anxious to finalize this bill as quickly as possible. But, in that we were in a quorum call and not quite there yet, let me just take this opportunity to say how profoundly disappointed I am that we were not able to do anything to move toward additional base closings. 
I doubt there is a Member in this body that doesn't understand that we have too much capacity. We had a force structure designed to address the cold war. The threats have changed, the force structure has been reduced, but the base infrastructure has not been reduced accordingly. As a consequence, with a fixed top budget line, that means we have to spread our resources around in areas that are not essential and sacrifice areas that are essential. 
We do not begin to have the amount of money needed to modernize our forces. We have been talking about this for years and we keep postponing that. The quality of life for our soldiers, particularly in housing, has suffered. The state of our military housing is deplorable. Nearly two-thirds of current military housing is substandard and substandard by military standards, which is even below civilian standards. I am ashamed at what we ask people who commit to serve this country to live in; how we ask them to live. I have toured and visited those barracks, those homes. As former chairman of the personnel subcommittee, I made it a point to visit many bases both here and abroad. The state of our military housing is deplorable. 
We cannot begin to shift enough funds there if we can't find the funds to shift. One of the ways proposed to address that is additional rounds of base closings. I know they are painful. None of us want to close bases in our States. I have had to participate in two base closings in our State and we only had two bases. But the people of Indiana supported that because they felt it was necessary, we did have excess capacity. And it was done in a fair manner. It was not easy. It was not painless. But it was necessary. 
The argument that we have heard here on the floor that we don't know what the cost is going to be is a ludicrous argument. If you take that to its logical conclusion, we ought to be doubling the number of bases because it is going to save us money, because if cutting bases costs money it just makes sense that adding bases, new bases, would save money. 
Every industry in America has had to adjust to the global changes that are taking place in business and become more productive. They have had to do more with less. So whether it's auto companies or electronics manufacturers or whatever, they have had to close excess capacity. Does that mean people get laid off? Yes. Transferred? Yes. Does it mean that communities are impacted? Yes. But for the institution to be viable for the future, it is a necessary step. Otherwise everybody gets hurt. Yet we refuse to do that here. I am just disappointed that we could not at least put some process--not even defining the process--but some process that would move us toward reducing this infrastructure and addressing the long-term problem that we have. 
We might not get the savings in 3 years. It might not directly offset in the 5-year budget plan. But we know it is going to accrue positively for the Department of Defense at some point in the future; that maintaining these bases is simply going to continue to drain money from essential functions, to put pressure on pay, to put pressure on health care for the military members and their dependents, to put pressure on housing, quality of life, modernization and everything else. 
Mr. President, we are moving toward finalizing this bill. It looks like an agreement is reached and I will yield the floor. We can talk about this more at another time. 
Several Senators addressed Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this week, Heads of State and Government of the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance met in Madrid and agreed to expand of NATO by inviting the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland to begin accession talks with NATO. These central European countries were always considered the likely first nations to be invited to join since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergency of democracy in these countries. 
Since the end of Soviet hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, these countries have strived to break free from the oppressive burden of State controlled economies and one party governments with great success. I applaud the advances which these nations have made. 
There are other nations which deserve recognition for their enormous accomplishments. While their successes have been more recent, they nonetheless have demonstrated a commitment in a positive direction which should be acknowledged and encouraged. Both Romania and Slovenia present a tremendous case for NATO enlargement. While the administration has determined not to pursue their accession at this time, I believe that these nations have made significant strides which certainly recommend them for NATO membership in the near term. 
The Senate has supported the concept of expanding NATO for those emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, which have struggled and successfully shaken the yoke of their former communist systems. In October 1996, Congress voted overwhelmingly by 81 to 16 to approve the NATO Facilitation Act. This bill provides valuable resources to assist these nations in making essential changes to their defense structure in order to help prepare them for NATO membership. 
Last month in the State Department bill, the Senate included Romania, the Baltics, and Bulgaria as eligible for this assistance. This positive step reflects the progress in democracy-building and economic development being undertaken in these nations. I believe that more needs to be done to encourage these new democracies along the positive path they are following. They need firm commitments and a clear understanding that NATO is not off limits to them. 
The amendment I am proposing, along with Senator Breaux, Senator Brownback, and Senator Gordon Smith, is a sense of Senate that NATO strongly signal other Central and Eastern European nations that enlargement process will not end with 
these first three nations. The communique from the NATO Madrid Summit states that:  
The Alliance expects to extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and as NATO determines that inclusion of these nations would serve the overall political and strategic interests of the Alliance and that the inclusion would enhance overall European security and stability. 
There should be invitations extended to other nations that meet the criteria for membership at the NATO summit associated with the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty in April 1999. It is important for the United States and NATO to continue to clearly demonstrate the intention to continue to enlarge NATO based on the progress of these emerging democracies. By so doing, NATO sends an unmistakable message to other central European countries that they will have an opportunity to become a part of NATO as they continue to strengthen democratic institutions, pursue free market economies, and modernize their military in support of NATO objectives. 
I believe that Romania presents a particularly strong case for future membership. Last November, the people of Romania voted overwhelmingly to elect Emil Constantinescu as their new President. His election demonstrated that Romanians wanted to firmly put the communist era--which had dominated Romania's Government and economy--behind them. In voting to oust Ion Iliescu in favor of Constantinescu, they rejected state socialism, stagnant economies, corrupt government practices in search of a revitalized economy, a new political openness and reconciliation, and a pro-western posture. With Constantinescu they got a reform-committed President and a parliament to match. The process of change in Romania is now firmly in place. 
Romania's new Government has initiated price liberalization and privatization. They are enacting laws to encourage greater foreign investment, a step which was desperately needed. The President has been clear from the start that economic reform would be difficult but the Romanian people have continued to support his policies. The international financial institution's recognize Romania's positive ecomomic steps and have reward them accordingly. In April the International Monetary Fund announced a loan of $430 million to Romania and the World Bank loans of up to $530 million. 
In addition, Romania has put aside historic differences with its neighbors. They have produced political agreements with Hungary and Ukraine to reconcile border disputes and resolve ethnic tensions. Indeed, President, Constantinescu has showed a tremendous effort to reach out to the Hungarian ethnic minorities in Romania by bringing Hungarians into the government. 
As a military alliance, NATO needs to take seriously the commitment of prospective members to contribute to NATO's collective security. Romania has also shown the commitment needed to bring its military to modern standards. They have expressed a willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs associated with NATO membership. Romania was the first nation to join the Partnership for Peace program and have participated in missions in Bosnia and Albania as well as other peacekeeping missions. They understand that NATO is not a one-way security arrangement. Romania fully intends to contribute effectively to the security and stability of the alliance. They are already increasing their defense budget and their military is firmly under civilian control. They are incorporating new training procedures to conform with NATO standards. In addition, Romania is well on its way to meeting the considerable interoperability objectives established by NATO. 
I believe also that Romania's geographical location would serve NATO's strategic considerations as well. Romania's membership would be an important asset in strengthening NATO's southern flank and provide a key geostrategic position at the Black Sea. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment as a commitment to continue the process of a NATO enlargement.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself a couple of minutes. 
I appreciate the comments from my colleague from Idaho, chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. This is not an easy issue to deal with. We have dealt with it on numerous occasions here on the Senate floor. We are attempting to maintain a consistent Federal policy relative to abortion. That policy, known as the Hyde amendment, essentially says that taxpayers' money should not be used against the wishes of taxpayers for elective abortions except in some very, very limited circumstances. Separation of that has been accepted on a consensus, at least a majority, basis now for a couple of decades. We are trying to maintain that. We do not want to make an exception in this instance because we do not think an exception needs to be made. 
There has been no demonstration that women who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies in the military are denied the right to have an abortion. They have that right. They can exercise that right. We are simply saying we do not think we should compel the American taxpayer to pay for it. That is something that has been the subject of debate and discussion ever since I've been in Congress and even before that. By a majority vote, time after time after time, upheld by this Congress, we have disallowed the use of Federal funds for abortions except in cases where the life of the mother is threatened or in cases of rape or incest. We are trying to maintain that standard, consistent throughout all Federal agencies, including the military. 
In one sense, really, in a very real sense, this is a solution, this amendment offered by the Senator from Washington is a solution in search of a problem. We simply have not had any problems with allowing women to obtain abortions at the place of station if it is allowable in that country, and if it is not allowable in that country overseas, to find military transport, not at their cost, but military transport back to any place in the United States that they choose for the performance of that particular abortion. 
In doing so, we allow the woman to exercise--even though it is not a right, I agree--a right guaranteed by the Supreme Court at this particular time, and she is not denied the opportunity to have an abortion. The question before the Senate is, will we maintain a consistent policy that says that taxpayers' money should not be used if it goes against their moral beliefs, their religious beliefs? Taxpayers' money should not be used for the performance of elective abortions except in very limited circumstances. 
I yield back, reserving the time.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me address some of the questions that have been raised here. 
First, on the question of denial of constitutional right, that is not an issue. Whether we agree that a woman ought to have a constitutional right to an abortion or disagree, that is not the issue here because no woman is being denied her constitutional right, whether that woman is in the military or not, or whether that woman is in the military serving in the United States or in the military serving overseas. That right is not taken away from that woman. 
So the issue here that will be debated, and has been debated, and will be debated in the future over a constitutional right to an abortion is not the issue that we are debating today. The issue that we are debating today is whether that abortion that is sought by a military woman ought to be performed in the military hospital. 
The proponents of the amendment say that we can avoid the Federal prohibition against use of Federal taxpayer dollars if the woman herself pays for the abortion. But that ignores the fact that the military hospital was constructed with Federal funds, is equipped with Federal funds, that the salaries of the doctors and the nurses and the staff in that hospital are paid 100 percent with Federal funds, and that it will be an accounting nightmare as identified by the Department of Defense to try to separate out the two. 
But again let me go back to what is more fundamental. That 
is this inequality of treatment. There is no inequality of treatment. A woman today who serves in the military in the United States can only get an abortion in a military hospital if the life of the mother is in jeopardy, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. That same standard applies to women in the military serving overseas. So the standard is exactly the same. 
If the woman serves in the military and is based in the United States and does not fall under the category of exception, that woman, of course, could get an abortion at a nonmilitary hospital in the United States. If a woman is serving overseas and seeks an abortion and it doesn't fall within the exception, she also can receive an abortion, either in a hospital in the country in which she is serving, or, if that country has a prohibition against an abortion, she can take a military transport at no additional cost back to the States, to Great Britain, or to some other country at which an abortion is performed. 
It is a legitimate question to raise as to whether or not that woman is being denied access to a hospital. Say she is serving in the military in a country that by law prohibits abortions and, therefore, a hospital is not available to that woman. Does the military in any way deny that woman the opportunity to have an abortion at some other place? 
I specifically inquired of the Department of Defense as to what was the answer. Their reply to me in a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense is that there have been no military people to their knowledge that have requested an abortion that has not been provided the opportunity to have an abortion, that has not been provided military transport to have that abortion at a place where that abortion is legally performed. 
I asked the question. Has the department had any difficulty in implementing the policy that abortions can only be performed in military hospitals in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother? 
Their answer: `No. We have had no difficulty on that.' 
Have any formal complaints been filed concerning this policy? 
`No. No formal complaints have been filed.' 
Have any legal challenges been instituted concerning the policy? 
`No.' Again, have any members or their dependents been denied access to an abortion as a result of this policy?' 
The answer again was no. 
Have any members or dependents been denied access to military transport for the purpose of procuring an abortion? 
The answer was no. 
Then I asked the question relative to the mixing of taxpayer funds, doctor salaries, nurse salaries, equipment purchased with taxpayers' funds, and they said it would be impossible to separate all of that out. It would be an accounting nightmare. 
So what we have here is simply a proposal by the Senator from Washington that addresses a problem that does not exist. The Senator from Washington would have a legitimate point, if there was a problem that existed. But no women are being denied constitutional rights to have an abortion. There is no unequal treatment. There is not any treatment available to a woman serving in the military in the United States in a military hospital that is any different from a woman serving overseas. The only difference is that if they happen to be serving in a country which prohibits abortion in that country, they have to go out of the country to have the abortion. But the military has never had a case where they have denied military transport--not commercial transport paid for by the military personnel but military transport available for that person for the purpose of securing abortion. 
So there is no problem. There is no constitutional problem. There is no equal access problem. There is no denial of constitutional rights. And there is no case presented to us out of difficulty in this particular instance on this particular problem. 
So that while the amendment may be well intended by the Senator from Washington it is clearly a solution in search of a problem. I understand the philosophical difference that exists between Members of the Senate relative to abortion. That is a debate that we have had before. We will have it again. But it doesn't apply to this in this particular instance. 
The President clearly in 1993 shortly after he took office was philosophically advancing his position relative to abortion. I happen to disagree with that position. The President has the right to hold his position. Those of us who oppose it obviously have the right to hold ours, and we debate that. But this amendment doesn't go to that debate. It doesn't go to that issue. 
For that reason, I hope the Senate will reject the Murray amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me just address a question that has been raised by the Senator from California. I think the Senator misunderstood what I said or perhaps I did not say it right. I said that while there is a philosophical debate among Members of Congress as to the constitutional right of a woman to have an abortion, I said we have debated that at other times and we will debate it at other times in the future. But what I thought I had said is that that is not what is at issue here. There are no constitutional rights of any woman being denied under this current policy and so that is not at issue here. Perhaps my remarks were misunderstood. 
Second, let me just say that this is not a policy that divides necessarily Republicans and Democrats. Congress changing hands had nothing to do with the change in this policy. The policy was changed by the President of the United States. This Congress has consistently voted, whether it was led by Democrats or led by Republicans, to uphold the Hyde amendment which prohibited the use of taxpayers' dollars except in cases of life of the mother, rape and incest. That has gained support from Republicans, gained support from Democrats. When the Democrats were in charge of this Senate, that policy was enforced. And when the Republicans were in charge of the Congress, that policy was enforced. So it really is not something that necessarily drives a stake, a lane down between Republicans and Democrats. 
Then the question raised by the Senator from Washington about the cost of military transport. Military transport is available to women on a space-available basis. Those who have had the privilege of serving in the military, as I and others have, realize the military is constantly flying planes back and forth not only to the United States but various bases within the theater of operations. 
If you are in Korea, there are flights on a regular basis and a voluminous number between the various bases in Asia. If you are in Europe, the same takes place. Women who cannot have an abortion because they are stationed in a country that prohibits that abortion have easy access not all the way back to the United States--there if they choose--but easy access to countries in Europe where we have other bases or other countries where they can go to get that abortion. 
So what we are saying here today has nothing to do with a woman's right to an abortion. It has everything to do with whether or not we will uphold, consistently support a policy and uphold a policy that says we cannot and should not force taxpayers who have a moral or religious basis to oppose abortion, to use their tax dollars to pay for those abortions. 
That is what is at issue here. We are simply trying to uphold the standard that this Congress has adopted that is currently law, law which, by the way, despite his own personal feelings, was signed into law by the President of the United States. 
There are no instances of any woman in the military who has been denied access to an abortion. So let us make sure that we understand the nature of this amendment, the nature of the issue that is before us and what we are voting on. 
Those who come down to this floor and vote on the basis that a woman's right to an abortion is being denied have not understood the nature of the current policy. I urge Members to uphold the Hyde language which allows abortions for life of the mother, rape or incest, to uphold the current Department of Defense policy which gives women the access to abortions if they serve overseas but cannot have it performed in that country. But let us not open up military hospitals that are constructed with Federal funds and equipped with Federal funds, let us not open up military hospitals whose doctors and nurses are paid with taxpayer funds. Let us maintain the current policy. It makes sense. It does not deny women opportunity to have an abortion if they want that abortion. 
We can have the debate about the constitutionality of abortion or what restrictions we ought to put on those abortions as we have had on partial-birth abortion and as we will have in the future, but that is not what is at issue today. I urge rejection of the amendment of the Senator from Washington. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we all want to improve quality care for child care. We spend nearly $1 billion now doing that. As chairman of the Children and Family Subcommittee I am committed to that. I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Dodd, and others for work in that area. 
The reason I oppose this particular amendment is, first of all, because it is an amorphous amendment. It brings a number of things together. There is one in here we tried to work out. I think we ought to oppose it, take it back to committee, bring it through, and bring a true quality child care amendment forward. 
This forces grandparents, neighbors, and family day-care providers who already comply with State child care laws to meet now an additional standard, certified by a State-recognized agency or entity to submit to additional monitoring in order to have the care that they provide qualify for this additional tax credit. 
We should not provide a preference tax credit for those who provide care outside the State certification. There are mothers and neighbors and relatives who do that who provide what they think is quality care and, more important, what the mothers and parents of children think is quality care. 
I yield whatever time I have left to the Senator from Oklahoma.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding, and I also commend the Senator for some extraordinary 
work in putting together a real tax cut package for the American people. 
There are items in this tax package that we have been attempting to incorporate, to give relief to American taxpayers, for many, many years. The Senator has been a leader and a champion of these. I am pleased to see we have arrived at a point where we can make substantial progress towards achieving these goals. The $500 tax credit for children is something that parents desperately need. It is something that has been far too long in coming. Parents have been put at tremendous disadvantage over the years under our Tax Code, if they are raising children, trying to pay for their expenses. This $500 tax credit is a big step in the right direction, in terms of redressing that. 
I have some concerns about the designation, the mandate that designates the credit is only received for children 13 and older if it is put into an education savings account. I will be speaking to that later, when the Senator from Texas introduces his amendment to make that optional. But I do support the other items in this package. It is far superior to the package that is being offered by Senator Daschle and some Democrats. 
I say `some Democrats,' because this is a bipartisan package. There will be a number of Democrats supporting us in this because they know families need tax relief, because they know that capital gains spurs investments, creates jobs, and more important, goes to seniors and to people, small business owners and others who are not rich but who have saved and accumulated over a lifetime, assets that are taxed away by the Government because of appreciation of those assets or, more important, because of inflation. One-third of the capital gains available today under this tax package goes to seniors. So the Daschle bill is an antisenior bill. A clear understanding of capital gains will demonstrate that. 
The changes in inheritance tax don't go to the rich, they go to the farmer who has been working on his land for his entire lifetime and would like to leave it to his children. They go to the small business owner who maybe started in his basement or garage and built up his business to a certain degree of asset level only for his family to see it taxed away and sold when that taxpayer dies, instead of passing on to his children. It goes to a large percentage of people who have every right to claim those assets. To suggest that we need an income redistribution, above what we already have, I think is a disservice. So I am in strong support of the Senator's position in opposition to Senator Daschle's proposal.

I further raised the statement saying that there are a number of Senators under the agreement that would stay beyond the three to offer and discuss their amendments this evening. They would be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes in support of their amendments. I don't believe we are under a time agreement and that there needs to be allocation of a time agreement.

<TEXT>
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the hour is late and the week has been long. We all need our rest. I want to take a few moments to speak in support of the Gramm amendment, the amendment we discussed just before the discussion of the Kerry amendment. 
The reason I want to speak in favor of the Gramm amendment is that, as someone who has been an original sponsor and long-time proponent of the child tax credit, we were surprised--first of all, we were delighted when, first, the President, and then the Budget Committee endorsed the concept of the $500-per-child tax credit. It is long overdue. It is only a partial step in remedying an inequity that has existed for a long, long time, in terms of giving families the ability to provide for their children. 
Way back in the 1940s, Congress decided that raising families and raising children was a good thing. They provided a dependents exemption for that purpose. They did not index it for inflation. And over the years, because it was not indexed for inflation and because it was not raised by an act of Congress, the value of that particular exemption decreased--that is, the dependents exemption. Now, we finally doubled that exemption, and now index it, after the 1986 tax law. But it was still a third to a fourth of what it should have been if it had maintained pace with the cost of raising children. So families were squeezed and fell further and further behind other special interests that were granted benefits in the Tax Code. 
We finally focused on the importance of raising children and the importance of families and the importance of providing support for the family. I am pleased that we are here 
discussing the $500 tax credit. I am pleased that the chairman of the Finance Committee incorporated the $500 tax credit in their mark. But I rise in support of the Gramm amendment because, in doing so, a provision was made whereby the credit would only be available up through the age of 12. At that point, the credit was available, but it was conditioned on the fact that the money be put into an education savings account. 
Now, it is ironic that, at the very time when the cost of raising children takes a dramatic jump, we take away the ability of parents to use that credit to pay for expenses related to those children. 
As this chart shows, entitled `Annual Child Rearing Costs; Children Ages 0 to 17,' there is roughly a $7,850 cost per child for children, ages 0 to 2. It jumps to over $8,000 for children, ages 3 to 5. It goes to nearly $8,200 for children, ages 6 to 8. And it stays about that level through the age of 11. But at the age of 12--at no surprise to any parent in this room, or any parent trying to raise young children--there is a dramatic increase in the cost per child when you hit the ages of 12 to 14, and it continues to 15 to 17. Why is that? It is because no longer are you able to tell your children that the $5 Kmart tennis shoes are good enough to wear to school. All of a sudden, they discover the Michael Jordan tennis shoes, and it is now $140 a pair. All of a sudden, the dentist says it is time that you saw an orthodontist, because if you want your child to have straight teeth, this is the time. The baby teeth are gone, the new teeth have come in, and we all want our kids to have perfect smiles. Some might be for cosmetic reasons, and many might be for a misaligned jaw or an overbite, and so forth. And clothes begin to cost more. Kids start thinking about the opposite sex. So that involves the thought of beginning to date and, suddenly, you are buying movie tickets and, suddenly, they are going out for burgers, et cetera. It is no surprise to any parent that that is the point in time which the cost really escalates, particularly when they get into the 15 to 17 age range. Then they are starting to work after school and they need transportation. Heavens, what an embarrassment it would be to have to ride the school bus. You need a car, et cetera, et cetera. There are a lot of necessary costs at this particular time, also. 
At that very time when it costs more, the Finance Committee has said, `We recognize that it costs more, but you can't use the money for anything except the purpose we deem is acceptable.' 
Now, it is a worthy thing to begin to save money for college, for secondary education, but not all children go to college. In fact, apparently, a large percentage don't go to college. So the education savings account that is begun or is mandated at the age of 13--they must use the child credit for that. I think that serves a purpose that we should not support. 
Now, some have suggested that the reason all this was done was to make the budget numbers balance, that it was to save money because those families that would not send their children to college, or didn't have plans to send their children to college, or didn't have the funds to accumulate for college, would not take the $500 tax credit and, therefore, are a savings. I hope that is not the motivation. I don't think it was the motivation, but that may be the unintended result. So we have a situation here where, ultimately, what we come down to is that either the parents are going to decide how to use the funds on the child tax credit in the best interest of their children, or the Senate Finance Committee will decide. 
Once again we continue the practice of Government knows best--not father knows best, not mothers know best, not family knows best, but Government knows best. We will tell you how you should spend or save money for your child. We will determine that it can only be used for one purpose. You have to continue a secondary education--a noble goal, a worthy goal, and one that I think we want to hold out as an option. But it should not be a mandate. It should not be limited to that particular goal. 
There are a lot of families in this category that have expenses for their children at the ages of 13, 14, 15, and 16 that are more critical than forcing them to put the money into a savings account. Hopefully, they will be in a financial position, if we think they can put the money into a savings account. Again, I say it is a worthy goal. But it ought to be an option to those parents. It shouldn't be a mandate. We should not have a Government entity--whether it is an elected Government entity or a nonelected Government entity--making a decision as to how that money should be used. 
It is almost humorous to say we know better about how a mother and father ought to spend money for their child than they do, that we know their family situation better, we know their education situation of their children better, we know their future plans better than the family knows its own plans. 
So, as well-intended as this mark in the Finance Committee package might be, I think that the amendment of the Senator from Texas makes perfect sense because it simply says if you want to do that with a $500 tax credit, fine, you can do that. We will allow you to set up an education savings account. 
One of the first bills I introduced when I came to Congress a long time ago was an education savings account. I think it is a worthy goal, a worthy idea. But if you deem that there are other purposes more appropriate, then we will allow you to do that also. 
To suggest that at the age of 13 suddenly the 13-year old is given the money and the parents are going to say, `I am going to take the money and go down to the casino,' like the Concord Coalition suggested--talk about arrogance. Talk about an arrogant conclusion; that is, that parents don't care about their kids, that they are either going to spend the money on beer or they are going to spend the money at the casino almost defies belief. 
Who do we trust here? Do we trust the parents? Do we trust the family? I am sure there will be examples. You can pick up the paper and read about some wayward father who took the tax credit and went down to the casino. Sure, that will happen. But that doesn't begin to describe the average American family who cares about their children, who want the best for their children, and are in the best position to make the decision as to how that money ought to be spent. 
So I am a strong supporter of the Gramm amendment. I think that we ought to modify this. Whether this is put together to create a deal--it is a lousy deal. I won't call it a rotten deal. It is a lousy deal, and the wrong way to allocate these resources. Let's leave that decision in the hands of the parents and not in the hands of the Government.

Mr. COATS. Maybe that mother needs that car to get to work so she can continue to make money so she can send her children to school, but we will be effectively telling her, `You can't fix that transmission.' We will tell that mother, `You can't use 
that money to buy a computer because maybe your child needs special tutoring.' And, `You can't buy a software program to give that child better math tutoring so they will be able to go to college. You can't use that money for that. You can't use that money to hire a learning center or some other organization to help your child prepare for the SAT's so that they can get into college. No. You have to do what the Finance Committee says. The Finance Committee says you have to put it in an education savings account.' 
I just think it is wrong. As I said, it may be well intended and well motivated, but the consequences are such that I don't think we have thought these things through. 
That is why the amendment of the Senator from Texas ought to be supported. 
I thank my colleague from Alabama for his contributions. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in responding to the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, as also addressed by the Senator from Connecticut, let me state that I share the goal of seeking ways to provide quality child care. This is something that I have supported, have worked on with the Senators. Clearly, as we are looking particularly at welfare reform, we are going to have increasing need for child care. We all want that to be quality child care. 
The goal that I had when we worked on the ABC bill several years ago was to make sure that the options available to parents for child care were not limited in any particular way. I was concerned about certification requirements. I was concerned about quality standard requirements because, clearly, at that time, and it is still the case today, the choice of the majority of parents relative to child care for their children is not a child care center but taking care of that child in the home, often by a neighbor, by a friend, by a relative, placing their child in a family child care situation, whether it is a church or a home or some other entity. 
Several Senators on this floor have talked in the welfare debate about training welfare mothers in projects or allowing them to be child care providers as other people under welfare will be seeking work. All that makes a great deal of sense. My concern with the Jeffords amendment is that it gives preferential treatment to just one choice, and therefore places those other forms of child care at a disadvantage. It doesn't take away options, I concede that, but it does place them at a disadvantage because you are biasing the choice. 
Now, it is a worthy goal to attempt to encourage a better quality care. But, of course, every time we get into this debate and discussion, it is always the State that defines what the quality care is, and the concern is that what is quality care to a State agency or a State bureaucracy is not the same standards of quality care that a parent might choose for their child. 
In a sense we are getting back to the same argument as we had before, and that is who is in a better position to determine what is best for the child in the interest of the child. Is it the parent who is in a better position to determine what their child needs in terms of child care and what the quality of that care is, or is a Government entity in a better position, or a piece of legislation able to describe what a better quality child care would be? 
So in this provision we are giving a preferential treatment to only one kind of child care, and that is child care selected by less than a majority of parents who place their children in child care. The latest figures I have are that 32.9 percent of parents place their children with relatives for child care, and those parents will not 
qualify, necessarily qualify for a bonus. They may not have the education, meet the educational criteria. They might not meet what the State determines as the quality criteria for their child, but as a parent I can tell you I would much rather place my child with a relative than I would with a child care center.

Mr. COATS. I understand the motivation. My concern is that there will be a large number of child care providers who will not meet those standards, will be put in a position that is less preferential than those who do meet the standards, and yet the standards might not necessarily be what the parent determines to be the best care and the best nurturing for that particular child. 
For instance, let us say a child care provider does not read, cannot read. Would that person ever be able to qualify for the standards? Probably not, because we are talking about a developing child. Yet, if the Senator had the privilege, as I and many of us did, of attending the national prayer breakfast this year, Dr. Ben Carson, head of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University, one of the world's foremost neurosurgeons, was raised by a mother who could not read. 
After I saw what product came out of that child rearing, I would want my child raised by his mother. Yet, obviously, the Senator's bill would not take away that choice, but clearly that individual would not qualify, with those standards, for the preference given under the Jeffords amendment. 
You used the words `nurturing' and `caring.' Nurturing and caring, as we learned in our hearing on development of the brain and other hearings on child care, is the most important aspect of early child care. It is not flash cards, it is not introducing kids to computers, it is the one-on-one bonds that are formed. Yet, we are putting those people at a different level. We are saying they really don't qualify for the higher accountability standards because they have not had the training, they have not had the education, they have not met the standards of whatever group sets those standards. 
I am simply saying I think the parents ought to set the standards. I think the parents ought to determine what is in the best interests of the child without a bias against someone who they deem is best in favor of someone who happens to meet the standard set by a particular group. 
It is a dilemma. I understand what the Senators are trying to do because that is a goal I think we ought to work toward. But I think it does so by sending a message that this level of child care that meets the standards is better for your child than the determination that you might make in terms of having a relative, of having a neighbor, of having someone down the street who doesn't necessarily qualify. That is my concern.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, just in response, I would say I think it sends a signal. It sends a signal if you have a State stamp of approval or certified group stamp of approval that your child is going to get better quality care there than if you do not have that. Yet, we know parents' preferences are, for a majority of parents, to place their children in situations where they don't have any State or certifying agency stamp of approval, but they are going to be looked at potentially as secondary care when it is not secondary care. It is in many cases superior care. Because they trust a relative, they trust a neighbor, they trust a family home care, even though it doesn't necessarily qualify for the certification standards. That is my concern with the amendment.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Supreme Court decision against the Communications Decency Act marks a departure from precedent on indecency, and weakens the protection of children by our laws. 
The Court, even in this decision, recognizes that Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of children. In the past, they took that standard to include indecency restrictions on every communications medium of our society--telephones, radio, television, bookstores, video shops. 
But with today's decision, the Supreme Court has refused to apply that standard to protect a child on a computer in his or her own home. It argues, instead, that unrestricted access to indecency by adults on the Internet overrides any community interest in the protection of children. 
In the Communications Decency Act, we gave a definition of indecency that was upheld by the Courts in case after case. Now the Supreme Court has apparently decided that this definition cannot be applied to the Internet. In other words, though an image displayed on a television screen would be indecent, an image displayed on a computer screen would not. It is difficult to understand how a child would understand the difference. It is the content, not the technology, that should concern us. 
The Supreme Court did leave some room for Congress to redraft the CDA along less restrictive lines, but, in the process, creates a privileged place for computer indecency, safe from the laws we apply everywhere else in our society. So, under the Supreme Court's guidelines, it is permissible for an adult to send indecent material directly to a child by e-mail, but not to speak the same indecency over the telephone. What an adult may not send a child through the U.S. mail, he may send a child via e-mail. This is inconsistent and incomprehensible. It is also now the official position of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
What this Court is saying is that it recognizes indecency when it hears it on the radio, sees it on television, views it on a magazine rack, or overhears it on the telephone, but it does not recognize it on-line. Computer technology may be confusing to many of us, but it is not that confusing. The confusion lies with a Court that protects children from indecency everywhere but the one place most children want to be. 
I expect that Congress will revisit this issue, within the restrictions provided by the Court. But parents must understand that the Internet has been declared an exception to every other American law on the provision of indecency to children. It is a place where the predators against your children's innocence have legal rights, announced by distinguished judges. Whatever its virtues, the Internet is not a safe place, without a parent's constant supervision. 
The Supreme Court has actually suggested that the very industry which profits from the provision of this material be the guardians of your children's minds--that it regulate itself. It is nice to have the Supreme Court's extra-constitutional advice on these policy matters--though I don't know why it should be more binding than the will of the Congress. I expect that we will have to live with this advice. But I hope that parents will understand that the Supreme Court has not taken your side, or the side of your children, or the side of decency. 
There are consequences of giving children free access to an adult culture with coarsened standards--consequences for their minds and souls and futures. Both the Congress and the President took those consequences seriously. The Supreme Court has not. 
This Court, which chose yesterday to undermine religious liberty and influence, has now chosen to defend immediate, unrestricted access of children to indecency. This is part of a disturbing pattern. 
The Supreme Court is actively disarming the Congress in the most important conflicts of our time--in defense of religious liberty and the character of children.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was sitting in the Chair and listening to the debate and listening just now. I came to the Congress in 1980, and one of the first issues we tried to do was the pending Social Security problem. 
Over an 18-year period of time, we have been debating Medicare and Social Security and what changes need to be made to guarantee solvency for the future. I don't think there is any Member on this floor who doesn't understand the facts. The trustees have reported over and over, we have had commissions, we have had demographers, we have had politicians--everybody has been talking about the problem that we all know is coming very, very soon: The problem that if we don't make structural changes within the programs, we are going to face imminent collapse of the system. It just can't sustain. The numbers are clear to everybody. 
There are a number of ways to fix it. As the Senator from Pennsylvania said, we can raise taxes, cut spending, impose penalties on providers. I find it somewhat stunning that a proposed phase in of a fix--which doesn't fix the problem, it defers the problem for another 10 years so the Congress in 2008 can deal with it as we are dealing with it here and every Congress before that--something that phases in over a period of 24 years that basically doesn't affect anybody in the current system, raises such a level of passion as if we are destroying the program. 
We are going to probably lose this vote. We will have postponed for the umpteenth time any solution proposed by anybody. No matter what is suggested, it is rejected. I have seen dozens of proposals out here. Every one rejected. The language always turns to--well, I don't want to use the word demagoguery--it always turns to pitting one class against another class, and those who are trying to get a fix proposed basically are labeled as people who want to destroy the system. Actually, they want to save the system. 
I don't think we have the political will to do it. Probably when the system collapses or is near collapse, the people will rise up and demand their representatives do something. I hope they look back at the record of all those who tried to do something over 18 years and, basically, were shouted down in the process time after time after time. We will undoubtedly lose this one, too. We will move on. Hopefully, we will get to the brink of collapse sooner rather than later, so it will not cost as much to fix it.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, because we are waiting, already after a long day, but because we are waiting for some material to come back, if I could ask the chairman of the Budget Committee a question that I raised at lunch. I know that the Budget Committee deliberated at great length on the issue of providing insurance for uninsured children and that after that deliberation, on a bipartisan basis, it was determined that a $16 billion chunk of money for the 5-year budget plan be set aside to address that problem. Many of us applauded the work of the chairman and others in not only that but in putting the entire budget together. 
Having said that, I am aware that we will be addressing the second phase of reconciliation and a decision on the part of the Finance Committee to add an additional $8 billion for that program in a block grant to the States. I am also aware of the fact there may be an amendment offered that may add to that an additional $8 billion, raising the total to double or more of what the Budget Committee decided. 
I am wondering if either the chairman of the Budget Committee or the chairman of the Finance Committee can explain to me what changed? What was necessary? Why was it necessary? What new facts came to light that required the additional $8 billion, at least? 
I know we will be debating this issue, and I do not mean to take up time this evening to debate it. We will debate it under the tax bill. But in the interim, I wonder if we can discuss that a little bit so this Senator can better understand what it is we are attempting to do.

Mr. COATS. I thank the chairman. Of course, he put his finger on my concern, and that is that before we have identified the scope of the problem and the resources necessary to address the scope of the problem, we have set aside a chunk of money, a very significant chunk of money, $24 billion. I just wonder where that figure came from and what it is based upon, because as the Senator from New Mexico has just said and we all know, once the money is made available, those who are beneficiaries of the money, whether it is the States or whether we put it in Medicaid or wherever we put it, they will find a way to spend it. 
I do not think anybody is arguing that we do not want to address the issue of uninsured children, but I think what we were arguing is we want to do it in a responsible way, a way that is responsible to the taxpayers so that we do not just arbitrarily come up with a number without knowing the scope of the problem and what dollar amount needs to be applied to that. 
So my question really goes to the rationale that was used in arriving at the $16 billion initially by the Budget Committee. I assume they had significant debate and research into that in arriving at that figure, but what has changed from that point forward on the Finance Committee? What new information did they learn that was not available to the Budget Committee that caused the Finance Committee to raise that figure by $8 billion? Was it simply the availability of additional tax money through an identified tax and a decision to divide it up and throw $8 billion here and $4 billion there and whatever, or was there a specific rationale or new piece of information that came forward that said, `No, we were short when we made our Budget Committee estimate. We now need to put in an additional $8 billion to cover the problem that we have identified'? 
That goes to the nature of my question. That clearly is something that we need to debate in the tax bill. I do not want to hold up the proceedings here this evening.

Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. As the Senator from West Virginia knows, we had debate on that during the proposal offered by Senator Kennedy earlier, which was defeated. But there was significant disagreement on the floor. I don't know the answer, as to the number of uninsured children, cost policies to insure those children, or the best mechanism to use. Even the charts that the Senator from Utah had designating the number of uninsured children and the charts that the sponsor of the bill, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, had at the same time they offered the bill; the two charts were off by several million, in terms of the number of uninsured children. So even the sponsors of the bill hadn't coordinated the numbers or checked with each other relative to how many uninsured children existed. We learned that three-point-some million of the children were covered under the existing Medicaid Program and several million of these children were temporarily uninsured, not full-time uninsured, because their parents were in and out of employment. And, normally, in employment you get a family policy that covers dependents. 
So I was confused as to what the total number was, how many were insured, and what mechanisms we ought to put in place and, more important, how we ought to derive a number. Obviously, we all want to be responsible with the taxpayers' dollars and, at the same time, provide the important coverage. I wasn't able to get an answer where there is some unanimity regarding the number of children, who is covered, who needs to be covered, how long they need to be covered, what the cost of the policy is to cover them. And it seemed to me that we were pursuing a problem by addressing a solution designed in terms of the amount of money available, not necessarily in terms of the specifics of the problem.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today is a very important day for students in the District of Columbia. Today, I join Senator Lieberman, Senator Brownback, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Gregg in introducing the District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997, also known as the DC SOS Act. The DC SOS Act provides immediate relief to thousands of the District's neediest students who are consigned to failing, violent public schools. This bill is a direct response to the needs of thousands of families in our Capital City who have, for too long, been expected to accept under-performing and often violent schools for their children. The DC SOS Act provides real educational opportunities to almost 4,000 District students. 
Many of you may remember that a very similar initiative was introduced by former Representative Gunderson, and included in the 1996 D.C. appropriations bill. At that time, a majority of the Senate, 56 Senators in all, were supportive of the idea to provide scholarships to poor students in the District of Columbia. Tragically, that program, which would have benefited 5,000 of our Nation's most needy students, was blocked by the threat of a filibuster. 
During the 1996 D.C. Appropriations debate, many of those who opposed providing scholarships for poor District students argued that the initiative was opposed by the residents of the District. That argument cannot be used this time. A recent bipartisan survey conducted in the District of Columbia found that fully 64 percent of Washingtonians would send their children to private school if they had the option and if money were not an issue; 61 percent of single parents think that creating a school choice program for the District is an excellent or good use of taxpayer dollars. And those most likely to opt out of the public system are residents of the wards 7 and 8, the areas with the most troubled public schools. Clearly, the residents of the District are ready for a change. 
But these surveys should not surprise us. The D.C. schools have not improved since the defeat of the D.C. scholarship program in 1996. Rather, the schools got so bad that the D.C. Control Board fired Superintendent Franklin Smith, stripped control of the school from the D.C. Board of Education, and installed a new Chief Executive and Superintendent, retired Army Gen. Julius W. Becton, Jr. Perhaps General Becton can turn the D.C. school system around. But I am not willing to tell a family who fears for the safety of their child that they should wait and given General Becton 5 or 10 years to test his approaches, especially because changes have been promised by five new superintendents in the last 15 years. 
In February of this year, the Washington Post ran a five-part series on the D.C. school system, chronicling its complete breakdown. A school system where jobs for bureaucrats are more important than providing textbooks. A school system that employs almost nine times more central office administrators than the national average, despite a decreasing student population, and a shortage of qualified teachers and principals. 
Many of the district's 152 schools are in a state of terrible disrepair. Students and teachers contend with leaking roofs, bitterly cold classrooms, and thousands of fire code violations. Yet, in 1996, the D.C. Board of Education allocated $1.4 million for its own use, an amount far greater than that spent by neighboring counties, and $200,000 more than is spent by the Chicago school system, which is five times larger. 
Unfortunately, these problems of infrastructure are minor concerns compared to violence and basic educational failure. Violence in the schools is at an alltime high--both student on student, and student on teacher--even as the violent crime rate in the country as a whole drops. And stories of academic mediocrity have become so common that they have lost their power to shock. Why is there no public outcry that the D.C. school district, which spends the most per pupil of any district in the country, has the Nation's lowest reported scores on the NAEP exams? Where is the outrage that only 35 percent of students are reading at grade level? 
Students are routinely promoted regardless of whether they have progressed in their studies and graduate from the school system with little to show for their 12 years of schooling. Eighty-five percent of D.C. public school graduates who enter the University of the District of Columbia need 2 years of remedial education before beginning their course work toward degrees. And more than half of all graduates who took the U.S. Armed Forces Qualification Test in 1994 failed. This last statistic is particularly troubling, because it blocks a traditional escape route from disadvantage. 
We are asking poor, inner-city children and their parents to tolerate circumstances that most middle-class and affluent Americans would not tolerate for one moment. Why should these families have to suffer violence and the lack of educational opportunities for another week, let alone the years that General Becton himself admits it will be before reform has any effect? 
But those of us concerned about this issue face an obstacle. No one seems outraged enough about the betrayal of these children by indifferent adults to make major changes. Not suburban whites, who are often satisfied with their schools. Not politicians, some of whom are either blindly obedient to teachers unions or may simply have different political constituencies than these kids and their parents. 
The DC SOS Act is an attempt to end this conspiracy of complacency. In introducing this bill today, I join with a coalition of members in both House of Congress who seek to provide scholarships for low-income students in the District of Columbia to enable them to attend the public or private school of their choice or to receive tutoring assistance. This bill is the single most practical, immediate, effective way to help actual children, with flesh and blood and futures, rather than continuing to ignore this very serious situation. 
I find it inconceivable that anyone, in good conscience, could condemn the District's low income children to attend schools that not only fail to educate them, but cannot even assure their personal safety. Some of the public schools in this city have become wastelands of violence and despair. We cannot begin to imagine the fears of a mother who is forced, required, compelled to send her child through barbed wire and metal detectors into a combat zone, masquerading as an educational institution. 
The introduction, and ultimate passage of this bill, will signal a fundamental shift in priorities. It would indicate to parents in the District of Columbia and all across America that we care about their children more than we care about maintaining the status quo; that we understand the depth of the problem in our Nation's public schools and that we are finally willing to address it. 
Opponents of this bill should carefully consider what they would do if they had a child assigned to a school where physical attacks, robberies, and drug sales were rampant. Low-income parents, who face this circumstance every day, deserve a voice and a choice. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the D.C. Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997. With this bill we signal our intention to provide a safe and effective school for every child in the District of Columbia.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am more than honored to come to the floor today to pay tribute to our senior Senator, Senator Thurmond, who has achieved such an outstanding milestone. 
Last September 6, I had the privilege of being at Oriole stadium in Baltimore to watch Cal Ripken break the consecutive game record held by Lou Gehrig. It was one of the most moving tributes in sports events that I have ever witnessed or ever heard about. And yet, when I watched a replay of that just the other day and understood the significance of an individual who had, through sickness and injury and personal concerns, established that probably never-to-be-broken record, I could not help but think of a similar individual who I have had the privilege of serving with in the U.S. Senate who has established his own record. And I think that the sacrifice and the commitment and the perseverance and the dedication of Senator 
Thurmond really can only be compared with that of Cal Ripken--two extraordinary individuals who have set their mind to a task and not allowed anything to come in the way of performing that task and achieving the goal that they have achieved. 
Of course, serving in the House of Representatives, all you really know about Senator Thurmond is the legend. You know he is a legendary figure who has provided extraordinary service to his country and serves as a distinguished Member of the U.S. Senate. So when you come to the Senate and have the opportunity to serve with Senator Thurmond, you bring with you a sense of awe, a sense of, how does this individual do this? But you also bring the perceptions that you read about in the press, `Oh, Senator Thurmond's remarkable service, but you know he's getting older and he perhaps doesn't have the stamina and the energy that he once had.' Well, it does not take you long here in the U.S. Senate to realize that that perception is wrong. 
The first thing you do is you meet Senator Thurmond and you have to shake his hand. And after you shake his hand, you have to take some aspirin because your hand is going to be sore for the next couple days, because Senator Thurmond has maintained a grip that few in the Senate half his age have. So my advice to any new, incoming freshmen or anybody who happens to run into Senator Thurmond in the hall or meet Senator Thurmond is, have a bottle of aspirin in your pocket because, after you shake his hand, your hand is going to be sore for a couple days. 
The second thing you find out about Senator Thurmond is that, as Senator Dole says, you watch very carefully what he eats because you want to eat whatever Strom Thurmond is eating if you want to stay healthy. And so we jockey to sit near him at lunch to see what is the secret of this man's success, his longevity, his contribution. 
And then, if you are like me and you are someone that enjoys going down to our small, little workout facility down in the Russell Building, you run into Senator Thurmond down there and you ask him, `Senator, how do you get to be the age you are and maintain such good physical health? How is it possible?' And he looks at you and says, `Well, I get up every morning and I do my stretching, do 20 minutes of stretching, and then I do 20 minutes on the bicycle, and then I'll do some calisthenics, and then I swim every week half a mile at a time.' 
Then he looks at you and says, `If you want to stay limber and you want to stay strong, you've got to pay the price.' And I wonder how many of us have the will to pay the price at half his age that he pays at the age of 94. 
I could go on and on with these stories. I had the privilege of coaching youth basketball here in northern Virginia, and I had the privilege of having on my team young Paul Thurmond. And so here I am in my forties--my son is on the team along with Paul Thurmond--and Paul Thurmond's father is considerably older than I am, and yet there he is in the stands right behind where I am coaching, watching those games and cheering his son on, who is a remarkable athlete, now a nationally ranked tennis player, I think, at Vanderbilt. 
We won the championship of that league, and in no small part due to the terrific contributions of young Paul Thurmond, who is now quite a young man. But I think what is remarkable to me--it was not Paul's athletic prowess--is the fact that Paul's father, Senator Thurmond, was right there cheering him on and with the parents of the kids that won that championship. 
I have gotten to meet the rest of his family, and I have gotten to see how Senator Thurmond handles a very, very complex and difficult job and yet cares so deeply for his children and for his family. 
I know that Senator Thurmond went through probably the most difficult thing that any parent can go through, and that is the loss of a child. I know how much he grieved the loss of his daughter in that tragic accident that took place. And yet, lesser people would have been broken by that. Lesser people would not have been able to recover from that. Senator Thurmond, I think due in large part to his faith, due to his strength of will, and due to his belief that despite the tragedies in our lives, life must go on, and did go on, and did it in a spirit that is commendable to all of us, because we know how deeply that tragedy struck him. 
So there are so many aspects of this extraordinary man that have left such a deep imprint on the lives of all of us here in the Senate and clearly the lives of the people he represents in South Carolina and to many people throughout the world. The impressions I have, the stories I have, the admiration I have for the remarkable person that Strom Thurmond is is really difficult to put into words. 
Initially, I was going to sit down and write a speech, but I really wanted this to be from the heart. I really wanted to come over here and say to my colleagues and say to Senator Thurmond, in my lifetime, I do not know that I have ever met someone like you. I do not know if I ever met someone who showed the courage and showed the compassion and showed the loyalty and showed the commitment to the people that he knows and loves and to the people around him and to the people of this Nation. 
I bet you could go back 40 years and look up the pages that have served in the Senate, and I will bet you every one of them would say the person that went out of his way to speak to me, to make me feel welcome, was Senator Thurmond. 
I bet you could go back and talk to staffers from over the last 40 years, or interns, who have worked for Senator Thurmond and hear such remarkable praise from them about the privilege they had of serving and working for him in the Senate. You could talk to any of us who have served with him and we talk about Strom almost in awe. How does this man keep doing it? How are we possibly going to have the energy and passion for the job when we become the age, or we hope to become the age, that Senator Thurmond has become--a unique person, a remarkable record, something that I do not think will ever be broken. 
I just want to say to him today what a great privilege it has been for me to serve with Strom Thurmond, what a great example he has provided to me and to my family, how much I admire him, and how much I want to congratulate him for his remarkable service. 
Now, the standing story here, and said with all seriousness, is when is Strom going to start preparing for the next election? We just had an election, but no one is about to say that Strom Thurmond is serving in his last term. This man of such a remarkable constitution continues to give fine representation to the people that he has represented for so long. 
Mr. President, I have another dozen stories illustrating the impact of this fine southern gentleman on this institution, but others will recount many of those. I just want him to know he has made a lasting and deep impression on me and it has been one of the highest honors and deepest privileges of my time in the Congress to be a friend and associated with and to work with the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy. 
I regret that I probably will not likely be in the Chamber when the final vote comes on the resolution, though the schedule has been changed so much, I do not think anybody is sure when that vote will come. If I am not, it is because of a priority of mine, the only priority I think, that would exceed voting for something as important as the budget resolution. 
My good wife, who has supported my efforts in Congress for 17 years now, who has missed many events, and has done a lot of waiting for me to vote and to come home, is graduating this evening with a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University. It is the result of 3 years of strenuous effort. She is a star student. It is something that I very much want to attend. 
I had thought and had been told that we would be finalizing the budget agreement last evening. We were not able to do that, and it looks like action on the resolution will go through the day. 
This is a priority I want to keep, and I think that, as important as the budget agreement is, I want to be there and honor this important date, and celebrate her achievement. As I said, she has done a lot of waiting around for me, made many sacrifices, and missed a lot of things because of our uncertain schedule here. There are times, however, when I think we have to establish priorities in life, and this is a priority. 
[Applause.]

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also want to use this opportunity to explain why I would have, if I am to miss the vote, opposed the budget resolution. I have examined this very, very carefully. In fact, I have tried to come up with sufficient reasons to support the budget. 
I know that the leader, Senator Lott, the leadership of our 
Congress, of the Senate, the work of Senator Domenici has been honest, it has been an honest effort at finding a true balanced budget. They have toiled for hours. There have been compromises that have had to be made as a consequence of not controlling the executive branch and the turmoil that will result for the rest of the year if a budget agreement is not reached. This budget clearly makes some important steps in the right direction, and there is much to commend about the efforts of those who have put this together. 
However, I have been here since 1981, and there have been a lot of promises about balancing the budget. When I first ran for Congress, one of my top three priorities was to balance the budget. I felt that it was unconscionable, immoral to pass on to future generations a debt burden so that this present generation could enjoy benefits without having to pay for them. I have toiled now for 17 years to attempt to achieve a balanced budget in the Congress and have not been able to do so. 
My greatest disappointment is, probably, our failure on two occasions by one vote to pass a constitutional amendment in this body and send it to the people of the United States to let them determine whether or not they think we should be held constitutionally responsible for balancing the budget. We were not able to do that. 
This budget, like all the previous six budgets, promises a balanced budget in 5 years. I have gone home after the passage of these budgets, spoken to my constituents and said, `We balanced the budget.' 
And they said, `We're skeptical of that.' 
`No, no, no, we have put in place a mechanism to balance the budget.' 
Well, six times we promised that, and six times we failed. This is the seventh. Our Policy Committee, which I support, tries to put the best light on this budget. I have here a report published by the committee, it says, `Balanced Honestly by 2002, First Time Balance Will Be Achieved Since 1969.' I have seen that phrase written over and over again. I have uttered it myself. It has not come true. It will not come true this time. 
People need to understand that 5-year, 7-year agreements really only commit us to the first year, and even with that, with supplementals, failure to enact rescissions, contingencies that come up--in fact, we have already seen a proliferation of attempts to change this budget, to add money to this budget, to change the spending priorities--Congress has the right to waive this agreement any time it chooses. 
We actually increase the deficit in this budget in the next 2 years from the current level estimated at $67 to $90 billion in fiscal year 1998 and 1999, and like all of our budget gimmicks in the past, all of the deficit reduction comes in the outyears, in 2001 and 2002. 
All of the tough decisions come after the next midyear election, after the next Presidential election. I have announced my resignation, so I will not be here. I will not be here to protest that `Here we are again. Remember back in 1997 when we promised a balanced budget?' 
Here we are at 2001 putting together the next promised balanced budget which pushes us out now to 2006 or 2007. 
All the rosy scenarios about the assumptions of no economic decline in the next 6 years, I hope and pray it happens. I doubt very much that it will. 
The other thing that distresses me is that in this budget we had the opportunity for meaningful entitlement reform and we once again took a pass on it. It seemed to me that everything was lined up in order for us to do this. 
We had a Republican Congress that had gone on record as supporting meaningful structural changes in entitlements, changes that we know we are going to have to face for if we don't, we are going to find ourselves in severe economic distress in the future. We had a President who had just been re-elected and was not going to run again. He did not have to worry about getting reelected or pleasing certain constituencies. And we thought he would step forward and provide real leadership on this. And he took a pass. 
Congress took a pass because somehow we materialized some additional revenue because of the economy, not because of anything we have done to hold down spending, but because of the good economy that we have in this country. And revenues were flowing in. And at the last minute we came up with $250 billion and said we can take a pass again. 
So when we say we have averted the crisis of Medicare's imminent bankruptcy until 2007, yeah, we have done that. We have done that with a gimmick of shifting home health care from part A to part B and applying more revenues to cover the deficit that is coming instead of implementing reform and giving the windfall in revenues back to the American people to whom it belongs. 
We have had to narrow our tax cut because we have not exercised the discipline on spending. I can go on and on. But I am going to abbreviate my remarks here so we can keep moving on this. 
It is worth pointing out that, rather than taking the $255 billion in unanticipated revenues and using it for deficit reduction or tax reduction, we have used it to increase spending. Rather than capitalize on the momentum that we had for meaningful entitlement reform, we used budget gimmicks and price controls to delay the crisis and postpone the tough decisions once again. Rather than reduce the size of the Government, baseline budget tactics are used, tactics which Republicans used to criticize--assuming automatic increases in the baseline and then making reductions in that baseline and calling it a cut when it is not a cut, it is an increase. This deceptive practice is continued in this resolution, and now Republicans have bought into that practice. 
In the end, this resolution simply postpones deficit reduction into the next millennium and lets everybody off the hook on tough decisions that ought to be made now. 
As stated in an article in the May 10 issue of the National Journal called `The Easy Way Out':  
Historic the deal may be, but not so much because of what it includes as because of what fell out: just about anything unpleasant for incumbents of either party. From a political point of view, it may indeed be a triumph; certainly, at a minimum, it is clever. From a reformer's point of view, however, it is a washout. 
We need reformer practices. We have said that; many have, since I have been here. I am now in my 17th year. We have not used reformer practices. Once again, we have used tricks and unexpected revenues to postpone the tough decisions. 
I have said from the beginning, and will continue to say it, we will not make the tough decisions until we are constitutionally forced to do so. We will not achieve meaningful reform in our budget until we are constitutionally required, by raising our hand and pledging to support that Constitution, that we will honestly balance the budget and not create deficits and not pass on debt to future generations. 
I am ashamed of the fact that during my watch, while I was here, the national debt has grown from less than $1 trillion to approaching $6 trillion. That is a national disgrace. And it has happened on my watch. I tried everything I could to keep that from happening. I think my voting record indicates that. Nevertheless, it happened on my watch. 
So for me, someone who will not be here to protest in future years, I cannot in good conscience support this budget. Is it an improvement? Yes. Is it probably everything that the Budget chairman could have achieved under the circumstances? With divided Government and an administration bent on spending more and making a mockery of their statement that the era of big Government is over, I think the Budget chairman did everything he could under the circumstances. I commend him for his work and commend the leadership for their work. 
But let us not pretend. Let us not pretend. And let us not pass on to the American people that we are giving them an honest balanced budget by the year 2002. I do not believe that is going to happen any more than the previous six promises on balanced budgets in the last 15 years have proven to be true to the American people. 
I regret that I have to vote against this, but I, in all honesty, cannot support this budget resolution. 
The most glaring problem with this budget resolution is that the deficit actually increases dramatically next year, from an estimated $67 billion for fiscal year 1997 to over $90 billion in fiscal year 1998, and does not begin to come down until 2001. The deficit then drops precipitously by nearly $84 billion between 2001 and the end of 2002. 
This rosy scenario is hard to believe. In fact, the only years that really count in this budget agreement are the next 2, when Members and the President can be held accountable to abide by their commitment. The heavy work of deficit reduction is postponed, and becomes someone else's problem. Even then, 97 percent of deficit reduction included in this package is based upon economic assumptions that seem implausible at best. They are based on sustaining the current state of the economy for another 6 years. 
This resolution fails to address the looming crisis in entitlements. Rather, it delays dealing with the issue through budget gimmickry. 
The resolution purports to secure $115 billion in Medicare savings. However, the overwhelming majority of this savings is secured through price control gimmicks that have failed in the past. Even then, the preponderant majority of this savings comes after the year 2000, when there is no guarantee of enforcement. 
The plan calls for further reducing payments to health care providers. We have tried this many times before with no success. In fact, costs have continued to rise while the quality of health care for our seniors has continued to be diminished. 
In addition, the current proposal shifts the Home Health Care Program, the fastest growing Medicare program, from the Medicare part A fund, to part B. This trick postpones the collapse of the Medicare trust fund from 2001 to around 2008, and serves to delay having to confront the long-term Medicare crisis. 
Failure to implement meaningful reform in Medicare represents the greatest single missed opportunity in a budget proposal rife with deferment and missed opportunity. In fact, the resolution creates a $16 billion health care entitlement for low-income children. It is important to note that this entitlement goes beyond covering poor children already covered under Medicaid. 
The key to busting the logjam in negotiations on this budget agreement was a midnight-hour $255 billion windfall from the Congressional Budget Office. This money came from larger than anticipated revenues from a robust economy. However, rather than using this money to both reduce the deficit and reduce the tax burden on the American people, negotiators went on a spending binge. 
The result of this is that the budget resolution actually increases, not decreases the size of the Government. For fiscal year 1998, spending is increased over fiscal year 1997 projected spending levels by an estimated 4.32 percent, or $70 billion above the freeze. This is the largest increase of the Clinton Presidency, $5 billion more than the President requested in his original budget proposal, and outpaces inflation by nearly 1.5 percent. 
This dramatic increase in domestic spending is based upon the concept that spending on these programs has been limited in recent years. In fact, according to economist Stephen Moore, over the past 10 years, 1988-97, Federal domestic spending has soared from $622 billion to $1.116 trillion. After adjustments for inflation, this is an increase of 40 percent. And now, under this agreement, we will be increasing this spending by a rate of 1.5 percent above inflation. 
There are no spending reductions in the budget. The savings are actually reductions in projected baseline spending. This type of baseline gimmickry is something that conservatives have long rejected. However now, for political expediency, this plan is based entirely upon it. 
James Glassman writes in his column entitled `Bad for Everyone': `The reason that the Federal deficit is projected at zero under the new budget is not that Government will be smaller, but that revenues from taxpayers will be larger--much larger.' Mr. Glassman goes on to point out: `According to the President's February budget, the Treasury was expected to collect $1.5 trillion from citizens and businesses in 1997. According to the new bipartisan budget, that figure will rise to $1.9 trillion in 2002. Meanwhile, spending will rise from $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion. And there you have it: A balanced budget.' 
Is this what reform is all about? Rather than use windfall tax revenues as an opportunity to decrease spending and accelerate the path to a balanced budget, this resolution gobbles up taxpayer money with substantial spending increases and postpones the tough decisions for another day. 
If there is anything hopeful in this budget resolution, it is some progress toward tax reduction. There is roughly $135 billion set aside for tax cuts. However, $50 billion of that number is offset by tax increases elsewhere in the budget, leaving a beginning net tax cut of $85 billion. This represents just 1 percent of the $8.5 trillion in estimated tax revenues over the next 5 years. 
Even then, the President's tax priorities for education, totaling $35 billion, is locked in, leaving Congress to spread the remaining benefit between a $500 child tax credit, capital gains reduction, expanded IRAs, and estate tax relief. The $85 billion net tax cut comprises about one-third of the money needed to offset all of these tax cuts fully. In fact, the Heritage Foundation estimates that the full cost of the $500 dollar-per-child tax credit alone is $105 billion over 5 years. 
However, the game doesn't stop there. A key aspect of the agreement is the assumption that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will adjust the CPI downward by approximately .3 percent. The result would be a hike in income taxes by approximately $6 billion dollars. Thus, the real total net tax cut under the agreement is $79 billion or less. Again, according to Heritage Foundation estimates, Americans will receive a grand total of 67 cents in tax relief for every new dollar of spending on Government programs contained in the agreement, or less than one cent on every tax dollar sent to the Federal Government. 
In fact, the entire net tax cut contained in the Resolution is less than one-fifth of this $255 billion dollar windfall discovered by CBO, and used to blow the ceiling on spending. The result is that much needed tax relief will have to be phased in, with the bulk of it falling, once again, in the out years. The child tax credit, touted as middle class tax relief, will likely have to be limited to low income families. 
Already, discussions regarding a capital gains tax cut have gone from an early 50 percent reduction proposal, to a cut of 10 percent, and is now moving toward a limited maximum rate of 21 percent. This is hardly the type of capital gains tax cut needed to free the hundreds of billions of dollars in encumbered capital in our economy. 
I do not believe that this is what the American people have in mind. And I have no confidence that future Congresses, faced with the skyrocketing spending and rosy economic assumptions contained in this agreement, will follow through on fully implementing tax relief. 
This budget is full of missed opportunities. Rather than taking the $255 billion in unanticipated revenues and using it for direct deficit and tax reductions, it has been used to increase spending. Rather than capitalize on momentum for meaningful entitlement reform, budget gimmicks and price controls are used to delay the crisis and postpone the tough decisions. Rather than reduce the size of Government, baseline budget tactics are used to simulate smaller Government. 
In the end, this resolution simply postpones any deficit reduction into the next millennium and lets everyone off the hook on the tough decisions. As stated in the May 10 National Journal article entitled, `The Easy Way Out':  
Historic the deal may be, but not so much because of what it includes as because of what fell out: just about anything unpleasant for incumbents of either party. From a political point of view, it may indeed be a triumph; certainly, at a minimum, it is clever. From a reformer's point of view, however, it is a washout. 
I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for allowing me this opportunity to speak. I regret that I might not be here this evening. But I think I identified the right priority in my life. And I am looking forward to being, for once, not the person in the limelight in our family but the person applauding the one that is in the limelight, which is my wife who will be receiving the degree which she worked so hard for. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, education is, for many of us, a top priority. S. 1, the first bill introduced in the 105th Congress evidenced that fact. The rhetoric from our President would seem to indicate that education was also his top priority, yet at this very moment he is supporting a budget which will result in a decrease of $1.8 billion to student aid programs. I rise today to support the Jeffords motion which ensures access to educational opportunities for all Americans. 
Since the early 1980's, the price of going to college has increased at more than twice the rate of inflation; growing even more rapidly than the cost of health care. This is the chief reason that a college education is unaffordable for American families. 
Initiatives, such as those included in S. 1, provide tax relief for families, encourage planning for the future through the use of college savings accounts, and build on already successful programs, such as Federal student loans and work study. These initiatives deserve our support. Unfortunately, the budget that we are considering today will make it virtually impossible to adequately provide these critically important programs to students and their families. 
I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and I in this firm resolve to protect higher education programs, thereby ensuring that all students have access to post-secondary educational opportunities. Access to higher education is critical and should not be compromised in this budget resolution.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his kind words. The real credit goes to the Senator from Pennsylvania for his effective and unrelenting advocacy on behalf of life. The Senator has expressed in many, many ways and provided us with many, many facts that I think gives all of us pause and that has given us a reason to give great deliberation and consideration to this most fundamental of issues. 
I also think it is appropriate to mention the efforts of Senator Smith of New Hampshire who had the courage to come to this floor some time ago and introduce the Senate to a procedure none of us had ever heard of. He was vilified on this floor and in the press. He had the courage to raise an issue that many didn't want to talk about. We have come a long way since that day when Senator Smith walked onto this floor. 
We are close. And we clearly have a majority in both the House and the Senate now in favor of banning partial-birth abortion. We have more than a two-thirds majority necessary to override a Presidential veto in the House, and we are hopeful that we can achieve that level today. We will know at 2:15 this afternoon. 
Mr. President, I think it is most appropriate that we are debating this issue on the Senate floor because we are talking about one of the most fundamental, if not the most fundamental, of all issues that we debate on this floor. That is the meaning of life itself. It is a right that is guaranteed or enunciated in our Declaration of Independence. It is labeled an inalienable right, meaning it is not created by government; it is not taken away by government; it is not the purview of government. It is an inalienable right, according to our Founding Fathers, the right to life being the very first enunciated, written--inalienable right, part of the very fabric of the foundation of this society, not endowed by government but endowed by the Creator. Over the 200-years-plus history of this country and of this Congress, we have had monumental civil rights debates, appropriate debates on the meaning of inclusion in the American experiment of what it means to be part of this greatest in all experiments in human history, of democracy, of being part of a system which allows each individual the dignity of being part, an equal part, of this democracy. 
Great civil rights debates have taken place in this Chamber, the debates about allowing women equal opportunities, equal rights to vote, equal rights to participate in society, the rights of handicapped, reaching out and providing within the American experiment to include them, the weakest of our society, the most disadvantaged of our society. And now we come to the weakest of all, now we come to the most disadvantaged of all, those who have no voice of their own, those who have no political action committee, no caucus, no ability to march, to speak for themselves, but those who have every right to be included in this great experiment in democracy. 
I do not know what the vote count is going to be this afternoon. I am obviously hoping it will exceed the 67 votes needed to overcome the President's intransigence on this issue, the President who pledged to the American people and to the Congress that he wanted abortion to be safe, legal and rare, the President who is confronted with the information that this is not a rare procedure, that this is a procedure that is done thousands and thousands of times mostly for the convenience not of the woman but of the abortionist, a procedure that is more convenient for the abortionist than it is recognizing concerns of women and certainly the rights of the child to live. 
I do not know what that vote count is going to be, but win or lose, we have fundamentally altered the nature of this debate. Win or lose, we are now debating the meaning of life and the right to life in this society, and that is where the debate should have been centered and where the debate needs to be centered. 
I am pleased that we have finally arrived at this point. I do not question the motives of other Members, those who vote for or those who vote against. That is why I did not question the motives of the minority leader when he stated that he thought we ought to engage in the debate on the viability of the child. It advances the debate one way or another. Some are skeptical about his efforts, about his amendment. I do not think it is an appropriate amendment because I thought the exceptions allowing the decision to be in the hands of the abortionist himself or herself was not appropriate to defining the right to life. But by placing in the Chamber the question of viability, we will now center the debate on what is the meaning of life. When does life begin? What are the rights of that life as well as the rights of the woman? So I am pleased that we have arrived at this point. As I said, win or lose, we are now focusing the debate where it ought to be. 
Several years ago, Justice O'Connor made the statement that Roe versus Wade, the decision of the Court in Roe versus Wade, was on a collision course with medical science because medical science was demonstrating to us the viability of life at earlier and earlier ages. Sonograms, listening to heart beats, and the ability to perform fetal research, the protection of the infant in the mother's womb, and the rights of that infant in cases of negligence, in cases of attempted murder, in a whole number of areas of the law have demonstrated to us that there is a life with a heart beating within the womb of that mother, and that life deserves our consideration in terms of the protections that we give it. 
Recently there has been a lot of talk about new discoveries of brain activity and a lot of focus on that, focus brought to this floor by those who say we must make sure we give children ages zero to 3 the right opportunities so that their brain can develop in ways that medical science tells us it needs to develop to a fully competent human being. We need to ensure that that takes place. 
What medical science is also telling us and what we have not discussed on this floor is that we now know that brain activity exists much earlier than we thought. Never has the conflict between science and abortion been more dramatic than in the recent discoveries about the science of the brain. We know that a human embryo at 10 or 12 weeks after conception has 
astonishing brain activity. We know that by the fifth month of gestation the brain is fully wired, as the scientists say, with the connections between neurons largely complete. Astounding evidence. We know that these neurons are firing with impressive complexity once a minute, shaping the brain itself, and we know that when this process is interrupted by malnutrition or drug abuse or a virus, the results can follow a child its entire life, and we know that a child may be born knowing the distinctive sound of its mother's and father's voices. In short, our mental development, not just our physical development, the mental development, the process of learning begins well before birth. 
If we look at the evidence--not the rhetoric, not the anecdotes, but the evidence, the facts--it is increasingly evident that human life is a continuum in which birth is really not a particularly decisive moment. An essential part of who each of us is, who we are, including the shape of our minds, is determined even before we are born. Even those who do not call themselves pro-life have to find this a troubling experience and troubling knowledge. They have to because abortion not only destroys the body; it extinguishes a complex, developed mind. This point, I think, has particular relevance in this debate on partial-birth abortion because the very procedure itself destroys the brain. Yes, it kills the body, but when we understand the complexity of that brain, when we understand the development of that brain, mostly fully wired at the point of termination, we have to understand that plunging a scissors into the back of that skull and sucking out the brain has enormous implications. 
Mr. President, I ask for just 2 additional minutes.

Mr. COATS. So here we are on this floor debating something that is very much in the role of the Senate. If it is not in the role of a Senator to make moral judgments, then we might as well close the place up because there is very little else to do. Most of what we do here has moral implications. There are some things that do not, but most things do. If that is the case, then I think a lot of people are going to have to remove their names from sponsorship of legislation that mandates mammograms for women under a certain age. Some Senators are going to have to remove their names from support for laws that require 48-hour hospital stays after birth. Some Senators are going to have to remove their support for laws and legislation that condemns genital mutilation. Are those not medical procedures? So if we are going to leave all that to the world outside of this Chamber, I think a lot of Senators are going to have to rethink their positions on a lot of issues. 
I also think it is inappropriate to suggest that this is some kind of male conspiracy against women. I think when the vote is taken today, we will see women voting to terminate this procedure. I think when the polls are taken and women are addressed throughout our society, we will find there are as many women in opposition to this procedure and in abhorrence of this procedure as there are men. 
It is also wrong to say that this is only some kind of a pro-life Senate movement. There are a number of people here who have openly stated they are pro-choice Senators but are voting to ban this procedure. So let us tone down the accusations and let us deal with the facts. 
I think the facts and medical science that have been presented to us so outstandingly by the Senator from Pennsylvania need to be carefully considered by each and every one of us. A civil right to the weakest among us, the inalienable right to life as enunciated in the most fundamental of all the documents of democracy, our Declaration of Independence, can be honored here today by our vote to ban this procedure. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania particularly for his outstanding work and yield back whatever time I have remaining. 
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. For the information of all Senators, at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning it is hoped the Senate will be able to reach an agreement allowing for the completion of the partial-birth abortion ban bill. If that agreement is reached, Senators should anticipate a vote on passage of that legislation at approximately 2:30 p.m., on Tuesday. 
Also, Senators should be reminded that it is the intention of the majority leader to begin consideration of the budget resolution tomorrow afternoon. Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout Tuesday's session, as the Senate attempts to make progress on the first concurrent budget resolution. Members who intend to offer amendments to that resolution should be prepared to offer those amendments during tomorrow's session. It is the hope that the Democratic leader will join the majority leader in an effort to yield back much of the statutory time limit for the budget resolution. All Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to any of this legislation. 
I thank all Members for their attention.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this evening I should like to take just a very few moments to report, along with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, on the recently released Quadrennial Defense Review. It was released today by the Secretary of Defense. It is the culmination of a very extensive process at the Department of Defense over the shape and makeup, the characterization and the implementation of our Armed Forces for the next several years. 
We are at a unique point in our history, particularly as it relates to defense issues. We have come through a period of time when our strategy was primarily based on the threat from another superpower--the Soviet Union--a nuclear threat that required an extraordinary commitment of resources, of manpower, of effort to try to contain and to try to nullify that threat. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the fall of the Soviet Union, with the realignment that has taken place with the United States emerging as the one superpower in the world, we may have the luxury of looking at our defense structure, of making decisions and beginning a process of fashioning our defense forces for the threats of the future and not the threats of the past. 
It is important to recognize, as Secretary Cohen has and as acknowledged in this Quadrennial Defense Review which was just released today, this is not a status quo situation. We have made extraordinary strides in terms of reshaping our forces from perhaps what was the peak of our defense effort in 1985, a very, very substantial decline in the number of active duty forces and the percentage of our budget and percentage of our gross national product that is devoted to defense. In the process, much of the framework that puts us in a position to make decisions in the future has at least been initiated, and the QDR, Quadrennial Defense Review, encompasses a lot of that thinking. 
Because so often in the Congress we receive the conclusion of the analysis of the Department of Defense after all the decisionmaking process has been conducted and after the options have been evaluated, we do not have those same resources here in the Congress to ask the appropriate questions and get the full view of where we think we ought to go with our national defense policy. So Senator Lieberman and I, along with others, in last year's authorization bill created a National Defense Panel consisting of outside experts in military affairs, who had a lifetime of experience, who could give us through this process a second look, a second opinion. I am pleased that they were able to have access to the process, the thinking process and the decisionmaking process that was undertaken in the Department of Defense on the QDR. They will now undertake a very thorough and very complete analysis of this QDR and report back to Congress. We have their preliminary report. They will report back to Congress no later than December 15 of this year giving us their view of current threats and future threats the United States might face, the strategy that we ought to employ to address those threats, as well as how we ought to implement that particular strategy and how we pay for it. 
So we are looking forward at a process, and I have described this process in some detail because I do not want Members to think that this is the final chapter in the book. This really is the initial chapter in the decisionmaking process that has to be undertaken by the Congress and the administration over the next several months, if not several years, as we look into the next century and try to define the national defense strategy and the force to implement that particular strategy. 
I will say this: I think the Secretary of Defense and the people who have undertaken this effort, the QDR, have done this in good faith. I think they have asked the tough questions. They have evaluated the various options. They will admit that this is an initial stage of the process and not the final chapter. They will indicate that there is more to come. There are more decisions to be made. 
But I also say to my colleagues, a lot of the burden and 
responsibility also falls on us. The Department of Defense has presented its viewpoint of where we are going in the future, but we are the ones who have to ultimately make the decision as to whether to ratify what they have said, modify what they have said, or reject what they have said and come up with our own alternatives. There are issues in the QDR Report to which a lot of Members, various Members, are going to say: `wait a minute, that gets a little too close to home.' We are talking about two more rounds of base closings. We have reduced our force structure more than a third since 1985, and yet we have reduced our infrastructure, our bases which support that force structure, by only approximately one-half of the amount that we reduced manpower. 
There is infrastructure that is excessive, and we are looking at a very difficult decision, in terms of how to go ahead and continue to advance the process of closing bases, of scaling back infrastructure, because every dollar spent on a facility or a support function that does not go to support our forces takes resources away from more pressing needs. To simply preserve excess infrastructure because it happens to be in a particular State or particular Member's district, or to preserve it because we were not able to come to a conclusion about closing it results in dollars staying in infrastructure that take away dollars from the very badly needed modernization of our forces, from research and technology, and from support for our active duty forces in terms of their readiness and deployment, et cetera. 
So we have to recognize that the decisions that will be made here, whether it is streamlining the Department of Defense, whether it is consolidating or streamlining various defense and support agencies, which is recommended here--I wish the QDR provided recommendations in more detail, but it is recommended here nonetheless--whether it is closing bases, and even decisions on modernization will be made in this Chamber, will be made by these Members, and they will not be easy decisions. 
We all recognize, I think, that one of the most important actions we can take, as this report says, is make decisions about modernizing our forces and investing in research and development of new technology. Whether this relates to platforms like tactical air for the Air Force and the Navy, ships for the Navy, land forces for the Army and Marines, or new technology to advance the way they do their business, all of that requires resources. And all of that will have to be done with offsets, because we pretty much have a static budget line. Without an external threat that we can foresee right now and without a major conflict, we are going to be at a pretty level funding appropriation for the next several years. If that is the case, then, if we want to retain the forces readiness, if we want to retain our current forces capability to deal with the threats as we see them, and if we want to restructure and modernize the force, we are going to have to provide them with the resources, and the only place we can get the resources is from existing expenditures. 
This report takes us some of the way down that road. I am a little disappointed in the QDR in that it did not more specifically outline how we can go about particularly restructuring the base closing procedure, how we can restructure some of the defense or support agencies, how we can restructure the Reserve and the National Guard to better complement our active duty; but also to define, in some sense, different roles for them in that process, how we could go forward in making the decisions on modernization, what the different options are, and so forth. 
I think there are several questions that Congress is going to have to address. I just mentioned modernization. Commitment to modernization, yes, but where do we put that money? What research? What new technologies? What new military platforms--ships, planes, et cetera--should we select? And how many of those should we buy? 
These are critical decisions. It is not enough just to say we need to increase our modernization budget. It is where we put those dollars that will be critical to define the military of the future, and how we address these questions about the role of the Guard and Reserve and the reductions in defense infrastructure, which I mentioned earlier. I am disappointed we did not address the medical care issue in the QDR. Clearly, how we provide medical care for our active duty servicemembers and their family members, Reserve forces and others such is a major cost item in the defense budget. That needs to be addressed in the future. 
Missile defense, how we allocate funds to missile defense, the Secretary says we have a shortfall in research and development funds for a National Missile Defense System and we need to shift a substantial amount of money, up to $2 billion, into that particular account--where does that money come from? That is not identified. 
These are all issues which the Congress is going to have to grapple with in the next several months. Beyond that, we need to ensure that, in our thinking, we realize this is the beginning and not the end of the process. We need to look to outside sources like the National Defense Panel to give us guidance in terms of what the proper questions are: How we look at the scenarios in the future that will require a defense structure to address those challenges; how we devise the right kind of strategy to meet the threats; how we build in the flexibility--because we do not know what all those threats are going to be--how we build in the flexibility to have our forces able to adapt to those threats of the future; how we avoid making critical mistakes in resource allocation that prohibit us from having that flexibility in the future; how we go about implementing all of this and how we come up with the resources to address it. 
So there are many, many questions still outstanding. It is an ongoing process. I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, as we explore this, as well as my other colleagues, both on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, as well as our colleagues here in the Senate.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I certainly agree with my colleague--we worked on this together--that this QDR report doesn't meet all of our expectations. We wanted a more visionary document. We wanted some bolder challenges, at least a broader definition of what the future might look like and what options we would have to address it, because the point is that we are at such a critical decisionmaking point, in terms of allocation of resources, that we need that look into the future in order to try to make the decisions that will give us the flexibility and the resources to address those future threats. 
The real concern here is that we stay locked into, not necessarily a status quo proposal, but one that closely resembles the current state of affairs within the military, and that we will, on that basis, make decisions that will preclude us from having the resources to make different decisions in the future or to address different threats in the future. That, again, is the reason why we wanted a national defense panel, outside evaluators and experts, to give us some guidance on that. 
While that Panel's report will not be available to support us in this year's decisionmaking process for the fiscal 1998 budget, it will be available for us next year. So I hope we can keep that in mind when we are allocating these resources and making these decisions. 
Second, I say to my friend from Connecticut that, while many of our colleagues, and many individuals, will criticize this QDR as a status quo document, my guess is it will be extraordinarily difficult to convince them that they ought to adopt even half of the proposals of this status quo document because it will affect bases that are located in their State, it will affect defense contractors that manufacture defense products in their State, and so on. 
Each of us has our favorite service, I suppose, perhaps one we served in. We try to be objective in that, but, you know: `I was a marine, and therefore, we're not taking one person away from the Marines,' or, `I served in the Navy, and we can't take ships down.' `They build ships in my district; therefore, I can't support any changes in shipbuilding.' And on and on and on it goes. We have that fight every year. 
So my guess is that, if we can implement half of what is here, it would be a pretty extraordinary step for Congress. 
Now, what is the point? The point is that we cannot just always blame the Department of Defense for not being bold enough, challenging enough, visionary enough when we ourselves are not willing to take some of those steps. So it is going to require several things: one, some good outside evaluation and expert help for us to even ask the right questions in order to arrive at the right decisions; and, second, some bold initiatives and some courage on our part in order to enact and effect some of these decisions. 
The Senator from Connecticut talked about a different kind of threat, driven by technology, that we are just now beginning to understand. We probably are not looking at the massed formation type of standoff, a mass army versus mass army threat that we have looked at in the past. We are looking at technology which can give our adversaries advantages that perhaps we have not even thought of and capability we have not even thought of; but yet also offer us great promise in terms of defense capabilities to counter those threats if we can anticipate them coming our way in the future. 
So there is a lot of work to do. I guess the caution here is that we allow ourselves to get outside the normal pattern of how we make decisions and how we appropriate funds for defense, to think beyond the next election cycle, to think into the next century, to be willing to take bold steps in either saying no or in saying yes to decisions that will have tremendous future implications for this Nation. 
What does that mean? That means that we have to have an open mind, we have to see this as a process and not as a fixed point for which decisions made today will necessarily be those decisions which will be implemented tomorrow. We have to retain that flexibility as we understand how to develop a national defense strategy for the future. 
It has been said that no major changes in military affairs in history have ever occurred except after a crushing defeat. We had a stunning victory in Operation Desert Storm. I think a lot of that was accomplished because of the lessons we learned in Vietnam, the changes that were consequently made. Yet, for us now to rest on that success and pretty much indicate that we are not willing to make major changes would condemn us to the lessons of history; we cannot simply strengthen and retain the capabilities of our last success, but we must fully understand and prepare for the potential of our next war. We want to avoid preparing for the past. 
That is going to take some bold thinking. That is going to take some stepping outside the box to take some challenging questions about current assumptions and the current status quo as we look out in the future. I think we have started that process. 
I want to commend my friend from Connecticut for all the 
effort that he has put into this and our other colleagues who have been involved in setting up our National Defense Panel and working with the Department of Defense, working with the new Secretary, who I think is committed and pledged to do this very thing. 
I thank the Senator for his time.

Mr. COATS. I do not intend to take a great deal of time. I wanted to comment on this particular legislation. 
Mr. President, I, like most Members, if not all Members, have been back at home discussing at official forums, school meetings, and with teachers, educators, parents, and students the impact of the current statute relative to education for children with disabilities. 
Clearly, there have been problems. There have been discipline problems, as the Senator from Washington has enunciated. There have been problems of excess regulations and paperwork for teachers. There have been accountability problems for schools. There have been funding problems due to the Federal Government not living up to its promise to fund up to 40 percent of the cost of this particular education. 
Now, there have been numerous attempts over the years since this was first introduced--in 1975, I believe--numerous attempts to modify and correct some of these problem areas. Most of those have not succeeded and many of the situations that have been enumerated by the Senator from Washington have continued. 
By the same token, there has been nowhere near consensus in this body to revoke that statute. I think there is a solid commitment to provide educational opportunities for students with disabilities. There has been strong support for that. There will continue to be strong support for that. 
The question this body has been faced with over the past 3 years is whether or not we could make substantive, important changes addressing many of the problems that arise under the current statute. Our task has been to make effective changes, gain a consensus in support for those changes, and preserve the essence 
of the statute. These amendments seek to provide all children with disabilities in America with the opportunity for education and do so in a way that provides more accountability, ensures a safe environment for all students, and addresses a number of the other perceived flaws in the current statute. 
This has been a 3-year effort. Senator Frist, from the Labor and Human Resources Committee, undertook the effort as subcommittee chairman last year under the chairmanship of Senator Kassebaum and spent an enormous amount of time and effort trying to pull a consensus together. We were not able to do that by the end of the session. 
That effort was restarted in this new Congress under the direction of the majority leader. The majority leader appointed a special task force of Members--a bicameral, bipartisan task force of Members--to see if it was possible to get everybody in one room around one table and address these issues on an issue-by-issue basis and come to some type of an agreement. Now, when you do that, you clearly end up with a piece of legislation that is not perfect from any particular person's point of view. It leaves probably more to be discussed and debated and perhaps corrected in future efforts, but the goal here was to see if we could substantially improve the current legislation. 
My colleagues need to understand that the choice here today is not between repealing the statute as it currently exists on the books and going back and writing a new one from scratch. I doubt very much we would be able to successfully do that, or at least come up with something that is in any measure different from the current statute. The choice is: Given the statute on the books; given what we know through experience over 20 years with this particular law and its implications for parents, teachers, students, educators, Members of Congress and appropriators, and others; given the need to put together a consensus that will allow us to substantially improve that current statute; the choice today is, stay with the existing law, with all of the problems that it has, all of the concerns that people have, or move forward on legislation which, while it does not give any one person everything they wanted, moves the mark very substantially toward a better bill. 
I think we have done that with S. 717. We have made a better piece of legislation, a better IDEA. It is better for children, better for parents, and it is better for educators. 
First, we increase substantially the role that parents play in their children's education. This is a very important principle, to involve the parents more thoroughly, engage them more in the decisions of placement, provide them with information that parents of general education students receive, and give parents access to all their children's records. This provision helps provide accountability, and helps provide a framework for understanding the problems that the teacher might be dealing with in school. 
Second, we include children with disabilities in State- or district-wide assessments, and in doing so, we provide systemwide accountability. Schools will now be responsible for what children in special education are learning. 
Third, S. 717 moves us toward a much better understanding of the inequity and imbalance that exists in the funding of IDEA whereby the Federal Government has not lived up to its promise to provide 40 percent of the costs of special education. We are actively engaged now in working with the appropriators and others to increase the Federal funding for this act. In fact, the Republican Party, as part of its top priority as defined in our caucus at the beginning of this session, committed to making good on the promise of the Federal Government to pay its full share of IDEA funding, and to no longer leave this obligation and burden on the States and local districts. I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee can help us this year in making a very substantial step in that direction. 
We have taken special care to address the question of the amount of regulations and paperwork that educators have to deal with. This bill provides far more flexibility for teachers and will allow them to spend more time with the children and less time filling out forms. 
Finally, we have worked very carefully and very thoroughly to try to craft a discipline provision in this reauthorization bill that addresses many of the concerns raised by the Senator from Washington. 
This is a particularly contentious area, and it is important that we understand that the task force looked at this very, very carefully and worked very hard to try to address these concerns. 
Now, in regard to specific discipline procedures, we came to the belief that parents needed and, in fact, deserved codification of major Federal policy governing how and when a child with a disability may be disciplined by removal from their current educational placement. Here we have a disagreement with the Senator from Washington. I understand where he is coming from. But to avoid having literally tens, if not hundreds or thousands of different standards, the Federal statute must include guidelines for a consistent standard that parents and educators can understand, so that everybody knows where we are coming from on this. 
The bill takes a balanced approach to discipline procedures. It does not go all the way in the direction that the Senator from Washington would like to go, and it probably goes further than others would like to go. That, again, was part of the consensus that we reached on this legislation. But we do recognize in the discipline section the need to maintain safe schools, and to balance that with the need to retain and preserve the civil rights of children with disabilities. We are dealing with a whole series of court cases. We are dealing with legislation here that has to stand the scrutiny of the courts. So we have to pay attention, obviously, to those cases and try to craft legislation which would give us a constitutionally sound and civil rights compliant discipline procedure. 
For the first time, this bill brings together the rules that apply to children with disabilities who are subject to disciplinary action and clarifies for school personnel, parents, and others, how these disciplinary rules work in conjunction with the school's obligation to provide a free, appropriate education. We have to meld these two concepts together to make an effective discipline procedure. The bill provides specificity about important issues, such as whether educational services can cease for disabled children--they cannot. But also how manifestation determinations are made, what happens to a child with a disability during parent appeals, and how to treat children not previously identified as disabled. In each of these categories, we have taken a very substantial step forward, and made very substantial improvement to the current legislation. 
When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of conduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or a demonstration of behavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child, or to others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance about educators' areas of discretion, the parent's role, and procedural protections for the child. 
Clearly, we must remember that we are dealing here with the potential for litigation, with court cases, with the civil rights of children, the rights of the parents, and the responsibilities that we give to educators. Finding the appropriate balance is not easy. It is very difficult to find that balance that will allow us to meet all these concerns and tests. 
Dangerous children can be removed from their current educational placement. I want to stress this. There is a belief here that there is nothing we can do with children whose behavior is disruptive, if they bring violence to the classroom or to themselves, or if they possess weapons or drugs; this is not true. Under this legislation that we are debating and will be voting on, dangerous children can be immediately removed from their current educational placements. Specific standards must be met to sustain their removal. 
So you can remove the child, but S. 717 states that you must then apply specific standards in order to sustain that removal. And it is possible to sustain that removal. If a behavior that is subject to school discipline is not a manifestation of the child's disability, the child can be disciplined the same as children without disabilities. 
If, however, it is determined that the behavior was a manifestation of their disability, then, obviously, there is a separate standard to follow. If parents disagree with the removal of their child from his or her current educational placement, they can request an expedited due process hearing. These are the parent's rights. If educators believe that the removal of a child from their educational placement must be extended, they can ask for an extension in an expedited due process hearing--once again, the balance of the rights of the parents, the child and the educators. 
The bill allows school personnel to remove a child with disabilities to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if that student has brought a weapon to school or to a school function, or knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance while at school or a school function. The bill gives school personnel the option of requesting that a hearing officer move a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if a child is substantially likely to injure themselves or others in their current placement. 
There are some other provisions here, Mr. President, which, in the interest of time and because others want to speak, I won't state. I just say to my colleagues that I very much believe we have made substantial improvements and addressed some of the major concerns in the current statute. I don't discount all the things the Senator from Washington says because many in my State have indicated the same to me. We have tried to address those concerns, balancing the civil rights of those students and what we believe are important educational opportunities for those students, with the rights and the needs of teachers to have an orderly and safe classroom. 
We have put all this together in this consensus bill which has been crafted with bipartisan support on a bicameral basis. I think we have a bill--maybe the only bill--that can pass. Failure to pass this reauthorization bill, or alternatively passage of the amendments being offered, would undermine the consensus process and put us back to the status quo. We would be right back to a situation where none of the complaints or concerns arising from the current statute are addressed, and we would probably go an even more considerable amount of time before Congress is able to put together consensus to address these significant concerns. 
So I hope we will look past what we believe to be perfect and look instead toward what I think is a good, substantial move forward in terms of this statute. I commend the chairman of the committee for his diligent work in that, and Senator Harkin for his long time support for this and the many others, including the majority leader, who worked so diligently to achieve this legislation.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding and, more important, thank him for his leadership on this issue. I listened, as the Presiding Officer for the past hour, to his remarks about the irony of the voluntarism conference taking place in Philadelphia at the same time the U.S. Senate is attempting to secure approval to go ahead and debate--not vote on but just debate--the passage of legislation that will make voluntarism more acceptable to the American people and provide an incentive for people to volunteer. 
I had the privilege of being designated as a delegate to that summit conference in Philadelphia, and as a delegate attended various meetings, shared time with the President and former Presidents who were there, along with Colin Powell, and Ray Chambers, and others who were instrumental in putting that together. 
The whole thrust of the meeting, the whole thrust of the summit, the factor that drew all of our current living Presidents to this summit, was the idea that we needed to stimulate and do whatever we could to encourage Americans to take a more active role in solving some of the problems that our families face and in contributing their time and their resources on a volunteer basis to help particularly those in need. 
The thrust was directed toward children, children that were falling into what we describe as an at-risk category, children without fathers at home, children without the opportunities that many children in America enjoy. 
The goal--2 million children reached by the year 2000--is an ambitious goal, one which will require considerable commitment on the part of the American people. Yet a number of organizations were there that pledged their commitment to reach that goal, a number of corporations pledging their efforts to ensure and help their employees participate in reaching that goal, whether it is mentoring a fatherless child in an organization like Big Brothers/Big Sisters or working through Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, various literacy programs, teaching a child to read, juvenile delinquency, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, all of these human problems that require not the hand of big Government--we have tried that, and it has been wanting--but involves the personal commitment on the part of individuals working with those children. 
One of the most encouraging things about that summit was that there was a widespread recognition on the part of people from both parties, different points on the ideological spectrum and political spectrum. There was a consensus that big Government was not the solution, that our, in many cases well-motivated, efforts in the past to reach out through the mechanism of Government to address these human needs had not succeeded, and that while no one felt comfortable with simply absolving ourselves of all responsibility, hoping that the so-called free marketplace of social interaction and community support would fill the gaps, clearly there was a consensus that the solution did not lie in more funding for various Government agencies, more Government involvement, but the solution lay in individuals making commitments to help kids in need, to help organizations in their communities that were helping children in need. And this was a very uplifting occasion. 
As I said, our former Presidents and our current President was there. We had Republicans and Democrats speaking from the platform, organizations that are doing extraordinary work today in our communities all across America. But the bottom line was, in order to accomplish the task ahead, we need more volunteers. We need more people to commit time to join up with a child in need or a family in need or an organization that is there to serve those people in need. We need to recognize those who are already making those sacrifices in volunteering, and we need to encourage more to do it. 
Anyone who has been involved in volunteer work understands that the benefit exceeds the sacrifice, if we can even label it a sacrifice; that the recipient of the volunteer's efforts obviously is supported and helped; but the rewards, not money rewards, but the intangible rewards that come to the volunteer are very, very significant. 
So out of all of this, I am confident, we have come to a time when there is a renewed interest in supporting our neighbor, supporting those in need, providing effective compassion, expanding the role of volunteer community organizations and charitable organizations, expanding the role of the church and encouraging its work in dealing with some of these problems. 
But one of the key impediments to that involvement of voluntarism that we are trying to encourage has been what I would call almost a tax on voluntarism. That tax is the result of lawsuits, many of which are frivolous, that have been filed against organizations or against boards of directors of organizations or of volunteers. It is a discouragement and a disincentive for individuals to volunteer. 
The Senator from Georgia referenced that. The first response to a bump on the head or a trip on a step is, `I hope you're not going to sue us,' because we seem to be in a pattern of litigation in what has been described as the world's most litigious society. It seems that for many the first thought is, `How can I collect? Who can I sue?' Well, it is one thing if individuals are covered by insurance policies; it is another if they either are not covered or those insurance policy premiums have risen to the point where organizations are finding it difficult to pay the premium. 
Over just the past few years, liability premiums for volunteer associations have risen 155 percent. So organizations like Little League and Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, volunteer fire departments, and all the myriad number of volunteer associations and groups that provide so much important help to people in this country are finding themselves squeezed, squeezed by higher liability premiums, squeezed from their ability to attract people to serve on their boards, to 
attract volunteers to work in the work of the agency. 
We need to recognize that every dollar that is devoted to increased liability premiums means that it is a dollar less that goes to meet the needs that the organization or the individual is attempting to address. 
Congress has attempted to address this in piecemeal fashion. I was proud to lead the effort last year to pass the bill that provided liability protection for doctors and nurses that volunteered their time to those in poverty that did not have insurance. Senator Santorum passed a bill that provided restaurants that donate food to homeless shelters, food banks and soup kitchens some protection from liability. 
But essentially what we are talking about here today is a bill that would expand the scope of liability protection to the numerous agencies and literally hundreds of thousands of volunteers who are not now covered or who find that the premiums are prohibitive for liability coverage. 
Of course, there are protections in the bill here. We are not excusing people from negligence. We are not excusing people for willful injuries or criminal misconduct. If a suit is warranted, the suit can be brought. But what we are saying is that there ought to be some protection against frivolous lawsuits, there ought to be some protection against honest mistakes, there ought to be limitations on liability to those who actually bear the responsibility for the injury, and not this, what we call joint and several liability, that flows to every member of the organization, every member of the board which allows lawyers to simply find the deepest pockets or the richest pockets to sue, and so if one member of a board commits an act which warrants an action against that individual, all members of the board find themselves involved in the lawsuit. 
As I said, liability insurance can be purchased, but the rising cost of that has been prohibitive, and it drains dollars away from the central purpose of that organization. In many cases we have people who are not covered by insurance, yet they want to volunteer their time. 
Mr. President, just a little bit ago--I think it was just a week or so ago--Lynn Swann, who is a former member of the Pittsburgh Steelers and is in the National Football League Hall of Fame, testified before the House on the impact of increasing insurance premiums and the problem of liability coverage for Big Brothers/Big Sisters. 
Lynn Swann is a national spokesperson for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. I had the privilege of serving on that national board with Lynn. He has dedicated an extraordinary amount of time and effort to promoting the concept of mentoring and promoting Big Brothers/Big Sisters as an organization that has been established now for nearly 100 years in mentoring children on a one-on-one basis. 
Lynn testified before the House indicating that the inability to pass liability coverage for volunteers was providing a disincentive to attracting volunteers to be Big Brothers or Big Sisters. Currently, there are 100,000 individuals in this country who have volunteered their time on a consistent basis--not a one-time only, but a consistent basis--to mentor and be a Big Brother or Big Sister to a child from a fatherless family, to a child who needs someone to come alongside, to be with them, to help them with homework or just to listen to them on the phone or to incorporate them in some of their daily activities, to be a friend, to be a Big Brother, to be a Big Sister. 
But there are 40,000 young people on the waiting list because we do not have enough Big Brothers, Big Sisters to match those on the waiting list. One of the reasons is that agencies have not been able to attract enough people because people are concerned about frivolous lawsuits or liability actions taken against them that they know they are probably going to have to pay or settle to some extent just to keep from having to spend 2 or 3 or 4 years in court dragged out through an expensive legal process. 
So we go back to the original point. At a time when this Nation's attention is focused on the concept of voluntarism and how it can support those genuinely in need, how it can provide help for children at a time when former Democrat and Republican Presidents and our current President are meeting in Philadelphia to promote and encourage and ask and plead with individuals and corporations and businesses and entities in America to do more, the U.S. Senate is voting to not allow debate on a strictly--I guess it was strictly a partisan vote. There was a clear division between the Republicans and Democrats on this issue. They were voting to not even allow debate and amendments to go forward to move to final passage of this particular legislation. 
So on the one hand, our Nation's attention is focused on the plea of President Clinton, former President Bush, former President Ford, and former President Carter to get more involved, to volunteer, to support agencies that are reaching out to children in need, calling for 2 million additional volunteers by the year 2000. 
Yet at the very same time the U.S. Senate is saying, no, we are not going to remove impediments to voluntarism, we are not 
going to adopt sensible measures to protect those who give voluntarily of their time to serve the needs of our communities and serve the needs of our fellow citizens, we are not going to do anything to take away any barriers that might be in place that are identified as limiting the size and the scope of the volunteer effort. 
It is just such a disconnect, just such an irony that our President is in Philadelphia urging us to become more involved in that spirit of voluntarism that I was privileged to experience in Philadelphia over the last 2 days, and that it is now clouded over with a deep, dark cloud that basically says, no, we are going to protect the lawyers, we are going to give the lawyers more protection than we are going to give the volunteers, we are going to make somebody who volunteers for Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts or Big Brothers/Big Sisters or any of a number of organizations and wants to give their time to the board, we are going to say that you are jointly and severally liable, if somebody on that board makes a mistake, we are going after the guy with deep pockets, we are going after the guy with all the money. 
So good people who want to give their time and effort to volunteer organizations and volunteer help find themselves restricted and limited because they may not have control over an individual on a board that does something that brings a lawsuit, that allows every member of that board to be swept up in that lawsuit. 
We are providing a disincentive to those citizens and volunteers who want to give of their time, who want to provide the support that children need in this country by saying, `Do not forget about the lawsuit liability. Watch out for the trial lawyers.' 
We are losing people, 40,000 young people on the waiting list for a Big Brother or Big Sister, and we cannot reach out to volunteers with any assurance that they will be protected from sometimes some of the most frivolous, meaningless, but yet effective lawsuits filed against them. 
Are we foreclosing the right of someone to go after criminal misconduct or willful actions? Absolutely not. That protection is provided in the legislation that we are debating. What we are trying to do is make it easier for people to be good neighbors, to be good citizens. What we are trying to do is to provide a recognition that as Government necessarily scales back its effort at providing help for humans in need--which has been an extraordinary effort. I am not questioning the motivation of those who attempted it. It just simply has not produced results. 
There is a recognition across the spectrum now between Democrats and Republicans that we need to find better alternatives, that we need to support the role of the church, we need to encourage the role of the church, parish, and synagogue, of charity, of volunteer charity organizations, of volunteer associations, of PTA's, of all of the groups that are working now in our community--including the Salvation Army, on and on it goes--who want to do more but need help to do more. They need our involvement, No. 1. They need our funds, No. 2. But No. 3, the least we can do is remove an impediment to voluntarism when someone's lawyer says better not be involved with that group because, as you know, while it is purely a voluntary act, if something happens to some member of the board, this whole board can be sued. Every one of you will find your name on a summons. Every one of you will find your name as defendants in a lawsuit. Every one of you will have to pony up for money to pay the attorneys. These guys will squeeze us for years until we settle, and maybe there is no liability at all, but we cannot afford the time. We cannot afford the ultimate money. So we will simply put a settlement out and everybody has to kick in. So people are discouraged from exercising some of their best instincts. 
This legislation makes a great deal of sense. I hope my colleagues who did not support the cloture motion, the motion to allow us to go ahead and proceed with this legislation, I hope they will weigh that action against what is taking place in Philadelphia. I hope they will take the opportunity, as I just did in our reading room back here, to go and look at the stories and pictures in a whole number of newspapers from across the country--the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Chicago Tribune, and on and on it goes, USA Today--on the front page of every paper out there. A lead item on all the news stories last night was the Philadelphia summit, the President's gathering, organizations pledging, individuals committing to a new spirit of voluntarism that, hopefully, will sweep across this country, hopefully will reach out to those 40,000 kids and Big Brothers and Big Sisters that are waiting for a match that can change their life, that can make a difference in their lives. For all those who want to expand the board, expand the participation and expand the number of volunteers, I hope they will go and read the headlines and look at the pictures. I hope they will look at the pictures of the kid waiting for the Big Brother/Big Sister match, for the involvement of organizations that can help their family, for the encouragement of groups like Habitat for Humanity and others that are making some an extraordinary difference in our world today. We want to do more. We want to do better. We want to expand that effort. 
What is stopping us? The trial lawyers--the trial lawyers who will not even let us go ahead and debate the bill and vote on the bill. A cloture motion has to be filed to prevent a filibuster. Because of a strict party-line vote, which escapes me why every member of the other party feels it necessary to prevent this at the same time their President is urging, in an eloquent address--one of the best addresses I ever heard President Clinton give. I am not often standing at the lectern praising the President, but it was an extraordinary address to the thousands that were gathered yesterday in Philadelphia. It was a plea for support. 
Here we are trying to provide one measure of support to remove one disincentive to voluntarism, to serving on a board of directors. As I said, I am on the national board of Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We have discussed this. Lynn Swann comes down and testifies and says we can put more kids together with more mentors, but one of the things that is holding us back is the liability we expose volunteers to and the extraordinary increase in insurance premiums over the past several years because of all these lawsuits. So every dollar that Big Brothers and Big Sisters worked so hard to achieve to provide a match between a Big Brother, Big Sister and a little brother and 
a little sister, every dollar that has to go to pay the increased liability premiums is a dollar that cannot go to provide for a match or support a match. 
I hope my colleagues will reconsider and allow us to go forward with this. If it needs to be amended, we should amend it. If it needs to be modified, we should modify it. But do not stop it from even being discussed, debated, and voted on, particularly at a time when our President and our former Presidents and our Nation is saying, `We want to do more. We need to do more. We must do more.' We should not throw a bucket of cold water on what I think is a noble effort, a necessary effort, to address some of the basic human needs in this country. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the generosity of the Senator from Georgia in allowing me to address the Senate. I again commend him for his efforts, and hope that when we get to the next cloture vote we can do better than we did today.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Georgia in bringing to light an important issue that this Congress clearly needs to examine and examine quickly. 
Two basic problems exist with the President's attempt to unilaterally overturn a 50-year-old law. The first is that it usurps the very function of the legislative branch, and appears to be a payoff, a payoff to a special interest group--big labor. 
The President, knowing that he can't secure the support of a majority of the Congress, simply decides to bypass the Congress. I think it is a pure usurpation of the role of the legislative branch. Second, it will cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in additional expenses. To mandate that each agency seeking to contract with the Government needs to get big labor's seal of approval before making a contract award clearly is going to add substantial cost to Federal construction and to Federal contracting. 
If the Clinton administration wants to change the laws governing the awards of Federal contracts, it ought to have the courage to send the legislative changes to this Congress for consideration. If then it can make the case to the American people that the changes are justified, so be it. But it is simply unacceptable for the President to cut a deal with a special interest group that has been supportive of him politically, with such a deal having tremendous ramifications for the American economy and, arguably, circumventing the law. 
We simply cannot allow this kind of power grab to go unchecked.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the American dream has been to be prudent, to save, to try to make life better for your children and your grandchildren than it has been for you. The current 
inheritance tax system takes away that American dream--the dream that one generation can build upon the success of another to build a better life for themselves and their children. 
The current tax sends a message that the Government will take away what you have earned and not allow you to pass it on. That is a disincentive to work hard. It is a disincentive to be successful, a disincentive to pursue the American dream because when you die the fruits of your labors will be taken away from you and away from your family and given to the Government. This is selfish? 
Mr. Summers, who speaks for the President and the Vice President, says this `is about as bad as it gets;' that it is about as selfish as it gets; that it is selfish to want to retain the fruits of your labors; that it is unselfish to give it to the Government, which in many instances wastes the money that you have worked so hard for. 
The President campaigned on repeal of the exemption for the estate tax, and Senator Dole when he was running for President on his proposal to lower the estate tax. Now that we are debating this in the budget, Mr. Summers comes along and says it is a selfish thing to want to do. I don't think it selfish, Mr. President, to allow the American taxpayers to keep the fruits of their hard-earned labors and not to have it taxed away to the point where they have to sell their farms, to sell their businesses, or to sell their assets just to pay the tax to the Government. 
Mr. President, I am a proud a cosponsor of legislation--in fact, four pieces of legislation--that call for repeal or at least reduction in the amount of estate tax to counter the efforts that are currently underway to eliminate even the exemption. I am pleased, and I hope that the Congress will hold firm on this issue as we go through our budget negotiations. 
I would like to, in closing, invite Mr. Summers to visit some mom and pop businesses in Indiana that are hard hit by this devastating tax. I would like them to visit some farms of some friends of mine who want to pass it on to their children and grandchildren but have to liquidate the farm in order to pay the estate tax. Come out to Indiana and tell the family that is forced to sell the farm or the business that has been in the family for more than 100 years that they are being selfish for wanting to keep that farm in the family and not to turn that money over to the Government. 
Mr. President, the Federal Tax Code is the only part of this debate that can truly be labeled selfish. The Government has no right to take unjustly the fruits of its citizens' labors. 
I hope the President and the Vice President will quickly disavow the statement made today, or reported today in the Washington Post, by Mr. Summers when he calls it selfish on the part of the American people to try to retain the business of a farm that they have worked so hard to acquire. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Georgia.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1003 and I urge my fellow Senators also to vote in favor of this legislation. 
This bill simply prohibits the use of Federal funds for the controversial and immoral practice of assisted suicide. It rightly keeps the Federal Government out of the business of killing. 
The bill prevents the use of funds to provide health care items or services `furnished for the purpose of causing * * * the death of any individual, such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia or mercy killing.' Death of the individual has been included because proponents of assisted suicide, mercy killing, and euthanasia often use other terms to describe these activities, such as physician aid in dying. In fact, the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which legalizes these actions under certain circumstances, specifically provides that `actions taken in accordance with [this law] shall not, for any purpose, constitute assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide'--even though the actions precisely are assisted suicide or mercy killing! The bill is very clear about the activity that should not receive Federal funds: an item or service furnished for the purpose of causing the death of any individual will not be funded by American taxpayers. 
Close observers will note that this broad language is used in sections 3, 4, and 7 of the bill, while more narrow language is used in sections 2, 5, and 6, where funds are prohibited for `causing the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual. The broad language is used with regard to the general prohibition on health care funding (section 3), the prohibition on the use of funds under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance Act (section 4), and the Patient Self Determination Act (section 7) to ensure that the activities and actions intended not to receive Federal funds in fact do not receive them. The broad language is necessary because proponents often describe these activities in different terms; it is used without concern of unintended consequences because the programs covered in these instances are clearly and narrowly defined. 
The narrow language is used in the bill's findings and purposes provisions (section 2, which does not have the force of law), restrictions on advocacy programs (section 5), and restrictions on funding for mercy killing, euthanasia, and assisted suicide in national defense and criminal justice programs (section 6) because broad language, if applied to these programs, could have unintended consequences. For example, if the broad language were used with respect to criminal justice enforcement, it may have the effect of prohibiting capital punishment. But this bill is only about funding for assisted suicide--mainly in Federal health care programs, because proponents of assisted suicide are successfully legitimizing assisted suicide--for some--as a form of health or medical care. 
Assisted suicide is not health care. Or medical care. The Federal Government, supported by all American by all American tax payers, should not pay for this. This carefully crafted bill will ensure that that does not happen. It deserves our support. 
Some questions have arisen as to whether H.R. 1003 applies to the provision or withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment, medical care, nutrition, or hydration. My reading of the bill indicates that the bill does not address such situations. 
H.R. 1003 is a deliberately narrow piece of legislation. It deals with the issue of Federal subsidies for direct killing, as by a lethal injection or a lethal drug. It is not designed to address or affect in any way, positively or negatively, Federal funding for the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment and medical care, nutrition or hydration. Nor is it designed to address affect in any way, positively or negatively, such withholding or withdrawal in veterans' hospitals, military hospitals, or other Federal facilities. 
Therefore, Mr. President, no one should read into the adoption of this legislation any expression of blanket congressional approval for the practice of withholding or withdrawing of nutrition and hydration or, for that matter, of any lifesaving medical treatment. This Senator, for one, is convinced that causing a patient to die of starvation or dehydration is absolutely wrong. I, for one, would not have supported this bill as an original cosponsor if I believed that it authorized the use of Federal funds to withhold or withdraw nutrition and hydration from a patient. 
Indeed, I am convinced that every Member of this body, and I dare say of the other body as well, can think of at least some circumstances in which he or she would agree that denial of medical treatment, or of food and fluids, is wrong and should not be subsidized with Federal tax dollars. Plainly, then in voting for this legislation we do not intend some broad sanction for denial of nutrition, hydration, medical treatment and care. 
All we do in section 3(b) of H.R. 1003 is make clear the narrow scope of this bill: that it deals with direct killing only, and not with these other practices. Thus, section 3(b) should be read simply as a scope limitation for this legislation, and not as expressing a substantive policy position on withholding or withdrawing medical treatment, medical care, nutrition or hydration. That is a matter for another day. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to express my firm belief that ours is a Nation that should direct itself to expanding the scope of the human community; to ensuring that all its members enjoy full access to the protection of life, liberty, and happiness. Our culture is one that increasingly commits itself to death, to killing those that some do not consider to be part of the human family. For years some in this country have treated the preborn child as unworthy of that protection. Recently, the President has vetoed a ban on partial-birth abortions--has allowed the killing of a child just three inches and 3 seconds from full protection of the law. Now our culture is moving toward promoting the killing of the elderly, the handicapped, those who suffer desperately--instead of offering them support, resources, and hope. 
I commend the Senator from Missouri for his excellent work on this bill and his steadfast efforts to prevent taxpayers from being forced to support a culture of death. His work reclaims some of our hope that America can again be a beacon of light in a culture of life.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, yesterday, I took the floor to detail what I thought was an extremely disturbing and very potentially abuse of Executive power of the White House to improperly influence the outcome of the American Presidential election. As part of that chronology of events of information that we now know that has been printed and that we are aware of, I detailed the situation relative to the latest scandal that has been reported in the press, and that involves Mr. Lake, former National Security Adviser to the President, an individual nominated for the job as Director of the CIA. 
Mr. Lake, as we all now know, withdrew his name from consideration the day after a major story broke about a problem involving the Democratic National Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council, and the fundraising operation of the White House. I think this is probably the most damaging, or at least one of the most damaging allegations relative to the entire fundraising efforts by the Democratic Party for this last election. We now know that the Central Intelligence Agency was used by the Democratic National Committee to encourage access to the President by an individual who is an international fugitive and was a major donor to the Democratic Party. 
The administration, in response to Mr. Lake's withdrawal, indicated that it was the confirmation process by members of the Intelligence Committee that is at fault in the withdrawal of the Lake nomination. The fault, Mr. President, I suggest, lies elsewhere. The Lake nomination was eventually undermined because Mr. Lake was forced to operate, or at least chose to operate or was forced to operate, in the very center, the very heart of a political fundraising machine whose abuses are revealed to us each day as we pick up the paper in the morning. 
The White House blames partisan Republicans, and yet a major story in the New York Times today, titled `Leading Democrat Tells of Doubt of CIA Nominee, White House Was Warned, Senator Kerrey's Reservations May Have Persuaded Lake Not To Fight the GOP,' hardly speaks to a partisan effort to dethrone Mr. Lake. 
Legitimate questions were asked of Mr. Lake of what his role was as National Security Adviser to the President in terms of clearing certain individuals to come to the White House for various favors, coffees, Lincoln Bedroom stays, et cetera, and, on several occasions--at least two that we know of--the National Security Council issued very direct reservations and, in fact, warnings about certain individuals who, nevertheless, attended more than one meeting at the White House. 
Mr. Lake's response was that he essentially was out of the loop; he did not know what was going on. Legitimate questions were raised: If you did not know what was going on with a 150-member staff that went to the very essence of the Presidency, of who sees the President, of what the involvement of these individuals is relative to fundraising for the election, if you are not aware of that going on, how are you possibly going to manage a multithousand-member agency with 12 separate divisions as important to the security of the United States as the Central Intelligence Agency? 
So even though the White House blamed partisan Republicans, we now know that the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee had raised his own concerns about Mr. Lake's qualifications and what his role was and the role of the National Security Council in terms of all this fundraising morass that the administration is caught up in. 
Mr. President, fortunately, publications that are following the story are not buying the White House response. The New York Times editorial today states: 
In the end, Mr. Lake was undone by Mr. Clinton's reckless 1996 election campaign and the failure of top White House officials, including Mr. Lake, to insulate American foreign policy from fundraising efforts. 
That is an extraordinary statement, Mr. President, and I want to repeat it. The New York Times editorial today refuting the White House response to Mr. Lake's withdrawal from nomination to be CIA Director, states: 
In the end, Mr. Lake was undone by Mr. Clinton's reckless 1996 election campaign and the failure of top White House officials, including Mr. Lake, to insulate American foreign policy from fundraising efforts. 
Jim Hoagland, in today's Washington Post, states: 
[Lake] is not a victim of the system but of the President he served. His angry words try to obscure an embarrassment and the true dimension of one more political fiasco at the Clinton White House. One more close Clinton associate is badly damaged while the President cruises on with high but flagging approval ratings. 
To continue: 
The system that did in Tony Lake is the one that allowed the fundraisers to trump Lake's staff repeatedly over access to the White House. 
In Washington the system is people--people who are supremely attuned to the wishes, needs, and whims of the boss. If Roger Tamraz, Chinese arms supplier Wang Jun, Thai trade lobbyist Pauline Kanchanalak and the others made it into the White House, it is ultimately because Bill Clinton communicated, in one form or another, that he did not want tight screening of campaign contributors. In the end, Tony Lake paid the price for Clinton's need not to know. 
That from today's Washington Post. Then, finally, Maureen Dowd in the New York Times states: 
Although Mr. Lake's `haywire' line got all the attention-- 
That is referring to a process `gone haywire' that Mr. Lake stated-- it was another sentence in his letter that provided the real reason for his withdrawal. 
Quoting Ms. Dowd: 
In addition, the story today about the activities of Mr. Roger Tamraz is likely to lead to further delay as an investigation proceeds. 
Maureen Dowd goes on to state:  
Mr. Lake would have had a tough time explaining why he was missing in action while the Democratic Party tried to use the CIA to pressure Mr. Lake's office to help get an accused embezzler and big donor access to the White House. The cold war might be over, but don't these agencies have something better to do than vet global hustlers and fat cats? 
Sheila Heslin, an NSC Asia expert with a regard for ethics unusually high for the Clinton White House, offered to shield the President from the notorious Roger Tamraz. But like the ubiquitous Johnny Chung, who also got into the White House despite tepid NSC warnings, Mr. Tamraz had his run of the people's house. 
So that's why Tony Lake pulled out: 
She concludes-- 
He was not Borked. He was Tamrazzed. 
Mr. President, former President Harry Truman had on his desk a sign that said, `The buck stops here.' Unfortunately, it seems that the sign posted throughout the White House and throughout this administration is `The Buck Must Rest Somewhere Else; It Sure Doesn't Stop Here.' 
Mr. President, we have a very serious situation before us. We have allegations, backed by substantial evidence, that the executive power of the White House was abused to improperly influence the outcome of an American Presidential election. We have serious questions about foreign governments' involvement at invitation by the Democratic Party and the Clinton administration, involvement in helping corrupt American elections. We have serious allegations, backed by considerable evidence, that the privilege of American citizenship has been distorted and undermined to serve the President's reelection. And now we are forced to ask, were American intelligence services manipulated by this administration as part of this fundraising machine? 
All of this, Mr. President, speaks for the need for independent counsel, speaks for the need to move this process outside of the Congress because clearly the administration has taken the position that whatever is said by this Member or any other Member of the Republican Party is simply partisan politics, that everything that happens is directed from a partisan basis. 
What we are trying to get at here, Mr. President, is the truth. What we are trying to do is examine what statutes were violated, trying to examine what ethics rulings were violated, trying to impose some standards on the way in which we conduct elections in this country and the way in which the White House is viewed and held by occupants of that White House and what its purpose should be. 
Mr. President, for that reason, I supported the resolution to call for an independent counsel. I would hope that the Attorney General would pay close attention to the recently passed Senate resolution in that regard. I think these are serious issues and they must be addressed. 
Finally, let me just say that the practice of this administration and this President of simply saying, the process is corrupt, that the Congress is partisan, that all of this has to do with politics and none of this has to do with ethics and legal violations, that that is a lame excuse and removal from accountability and responsibility that we expect in the leadership of this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not believe I will consume the full 40 minutes. In fact, I am sure I will not. And if I finish before that, I would be happy to yield that time back to expedite the process. 
Mr. President, I generally believe that the Senate floor should be a place to talk about issues, not about scandals. So my first inclination is to voice my support for an independent counsel and hope the process will take its course. The need for this investigation should be beyond question, proven on the front page of the newspaper every morning. 
Under normal circumstances, there would be little more to say. But this circumstance is not normal because it now concerns some of the most disturbing questions that can be asked in a democracy. 
Was the executive power of the White House abused to improperly influence the outcome of an American Presidential election? 
Were foreign governments invited by the Democratic Party and the Clinton administration to corrupt American elections? 
Was the privilege of American citizenship distorted and undermined to serve the President's reelection? 
And now we are forced to ask, were American intelligence services manipulated by this administration as part of its fundraising machine? 
The revelations that began last October, and have continued until this morning, do not primarily concern the low standards of our current campaign finance system. Those standards, it has been argued, should be changed. We will be debating that in this body. 
What the almost daily revelations we have seen do concern are the legal and ethical breaches of the current standards by the Clinton administration. And that charge is different in kind in the seriousness from the policy debate on campaign finance reform. 
It is not the technical violation of campaign finance law that primarily concern me. Those are for lawyers and prosecutors to debate and decide. The issue is far greater than the sum of those ethical and legal problems. All of the strands of this scandal--high-pressure soft-money fundraising, illegal foreign contributions, the abuse of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and of the CIA--reveal an administration obsessed with reelection, indifferent to ethical rules and organized to skirt the law. 
All of these efforts were directed toward one event, and one date: The Presidential election on November 5, 1996. 
There are countless complex elements to this scandal, but only one central issue. Was the executive branch of Government corrupted and compromised by a rogue political election operation centered in the Democratic National Committee, the Office of the President, the Office of the Vice President, and the Office of the First Lady? 
By definition--no matter what the justification--this would not just be a violation of legal and ethical standards regarding campaign financing, but arguably a crime against democracy itself. 
The most recent revelation is one of the most damaging. We now know that the Central Intelligence Agency was used by the Democratic National Committee to encourage access to the President by Roger Tamraz, an international fugitive and major donor to the Democrat Party. 
We know that Donald Fowler, chairman of the DNC, made a call to the CIA asking that that agency provide classified information to the White House about Mr. Tamraz and his business interests in a pipeline project funded partially by Chinese businessmen. 
When the National Security Council refused to recommend a meeting between Mr. Tamraz and President Clinton, the White House eventually scheduled at least four that we know of. One meeting in April 1996 took place while Mr. Tamraz was being sought for questioning by Interpol, the international police agency, for bank fraud in Lebanon. Mr. Tamraz made $177,000 in donations to Democrat causes and maintained business ties with both Saddam 
Hussein's Iraq and Muammar Qadhafi's Libya. 
The White House has responded by saying in effect, as they have said to every issue that has been raised regarding their ethics and regarding their fundraising operation, `Well, everyone is doing it.' 
Mr. President, unless there are things going on here in the Senate that I do not know about, the White House defense that `everyone is doing it' does not apply here. 
It has been said that the confirmation process is at fault in the withdrawal of the Anthony Lake nomination, the individual who headed the National Security Council during these events. 
The fault, in fact, Mr. President, lies elsewhere. The Lake nomination was eventually undermined because he was forced to operate in the heart of a political fundraising machine whose abuses are being revealed to us in expanded detail each day. 
The White House blames partisan Republicans, but the final straw in the failure of this nomination came because our intelligence services were politicized for partisan political advantage. 
We are not entirely sure what Mr. Lake's role was in this. That is the reason why we requested interviews with NSC staff, interviews that were denied, and why we were going to seek today subpoenas to order those interviews to take place. 
But we do know what the White House role was. And it was clearly inappropriate. If Anthony Lake is the victim of a political process gone haywire, that political process is to be found in the White House itself. 
The most recent revelation is part of a pattern, a pattern of abusing executive power for political ends. 
Concerning political solicitation at the White House, we now know that the Office of the President, the Office of the Vice President, and the Office of the First Lady were all involved in these efforts. 
We know that the President's request for immediate action on fundraising in early 1995--the written message that read `ready to start overnights right away'--we know that this began a program of White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom overnights that eventually raised nearly $40 million. 
We know that an unsigned memo was written to Martha Phipps, deputy chief of staff to the chairman of the Democratic Party, which suggested 10 White House rewards for major donors: two seats on Air Force One, two seats on Air Force Two; six seats at all private dinners; six to eight spots at all White House ceremonies and events; official delegation trips abroad; better coordination on appointments to boards and commissions; White House mess privileges; White House resident visits and overnight stays; guaranteed Kennedy Center tickets; six radio address spots; photo opportunities with White House principals. 
We know, Mr. President, that at least 7 of these 10 perks were actually used in fundraising efforts. We know that the administration, in its fundraising efforts, applied few, if any, ethical standards to those who were given access to the White House. 
Included in the White House coffees with President Clinton were a major drug dealer, a twice-convicted felon for theft and tax offenses, a Chinese arms dealer, and an international fugitive on conspiracy and embezzlement charges. 
We know that the Vice President, Mr. Gore, solicited campaign contributions by telephone from his White House office on more than 50 occasions. One business figure who received a call recounts--and I quote--`There were elements of a shakedown in the call. It was very awkward. For a Vice President, particularly this Vice President who has real power and is the heir apparent, to ask for money gave me no choice.' 
We know that the First Lady's chief of staff, Margaret Williams, accepted a $50,000 political contribution at the White House. 
We know that Harold Ickes, assistant to the President, wrote a memo to a major Democrat contributor advising him on ways to make a $5 million contribution to the Democratic National Committee tax deductible. The three-page document detailed how such a contribution could be filtered through 501(c)3 organizations that were helpful to Democrat reelection efforts. In the memo, Mr. Ickes wrote, `If possible, it would be greatly appreciated if the following amounts could be wired to designated banks.' 
We know there was a clear direction from the President and First Lady to use a White House computer database for political purposes. That database, by the way, was purchased with $1.7 million of taxpayer dollars. One memo marked `Confidential' from White House political aide Marsha Scott argues that the database be made available `to the [Democrat National Committee] and other entities we choose to work with for political purposes.' On this memo are the handwritten words, `This sounds promising. Please advise.' Signed HRC. 
Another memo from Ms. Scott, to Erskine Bowles, the President's current chief of staff, outlines a plan to use the database to reward supporters with `trinkets' and access. The memo concludes, `This is the President's idea and it is a good one.' 
Another memo from Ms. Scott to Thomas McLarty, the President's former chief of staff, states of this plan, `Both the President and the First Lady have asked me to make this my top priority.' 
We know, Mr. President, that former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum, early in the Clinton administration, had contributed a memo titled `Criminal Statutes.' In that memo he wrote, `A number of criminal statutes prohibit the use of Federal programs, [Federal] property or employment for political purposes. Violation of these criminal statutes is punishable by imprisonment and/or payment of a substantial fine.' The memo went on to outline the type of activities clearly prohibited by the law: `Soliciting or receiving campaign contributions on Federal property or in Federal buildings. This means that fundraising events may not be held [--may not be held--] at the White House; that no fundraising phone calls or mail may emanate from the White House or any other Federal buildings; and that no campaign contributions may be accepted at the White House or any other Federal buildings.' 
So, Mr. President, based on the Nussbaum memo, the former White House counsel memo, then White House counsel, we know this administration was fully informed of these ethical and legal standards, the standards of the current system, but we also know those standards were broadly and repeatedly violated at every level of the Clinton White House. 
And then there is the issue of White House political involvement in foreign political contributions. 
We know that many of the principal figures in the current scandal--including John Huang, Charlie Trie and Johnny Chung--have been longtime Clinton supporters, some brought to Washington from Arkansas. They have had open access to this administration --Huang visiting the White House 78 times in 15 months and Chung visiting at least 49 times. 
We know that Johnny Chung took six Chinese businessmen to the White House to hear President Clinton's radio address on March 11, 1996, in exchange for a $50,000 contribution to the Democratic National Committee--the contribution that was given to Margaret Williams on March 17. 
We know that Charlie Trie attempted to make a $460,000 contribution to the President's legal defense fund, claiming the money was collected from a variety of sources. Yet the serial numbers on the money orders were sequential and much of the handwriting was identical. Initially, only $70,000 of the money was returned. It took several months for the law firm overseeing the fund to return the remainder of the contribution. 
We know, Mr. President, that John Huang was an official at the 
Clinton Commerce Department with a top-secret security clearance. While an official at Commerce, he recommended policies unfavorable to Taiwan and supported by China. We know that John Huang visited the Chinese Embassy at least two times during his tenure. In one instance, Mr. Huang requested top-secret documents on May 10, 1995, the day he was scheduled to meet the Chinese Ambassador. 
We know that in an Oval Office meeting on September 13, 1995 --including President Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, John Huang, and James Riady, the Indonesian head of the Lippo Group--a decision was made to transfer Mr. Huang to the Democratic National Committee where he became vice chairman of finance. 
We know that John Huang approached officials of the Asian American Business Roundtable with a plan to channel more than $250,000 through roundtable members to the Democratic National Committee in return for a $45,000 kickback. 
We know Huang helped arrange a California fundraiser at a Buddhist temple, attended by Vice President Gore, in which illegal contributions were transmitted to the DNC through third parties. One participant was paid $5,000 in cash in small bills and told to write a check. Vice President Gore claimed for 2 months he was unaware this event was a fundraiser. But a memo later surfaced that revealed that Vice President Gore's staff had briefed him on the fundraising purpose of the event. 
We know that John Huang raised more than $3 million for Democrats in illegal contributions from Asian sources. 
We know that the FBI, based on surveillance of the Chinese Embassy, expressed serious concerns that the Chinese Government was attempting to influence American elections through illegal contributions. That information was communicated to two officials at the Clinton White House in June of 1996. For reasons that for the moment are unclear, Mr. President, that information was not acted upon. 
Another area of White House political involvement concerns the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
We know in September 1995 a Democrat activist from Illinois wrote to the First Lady to alert her of an `opportunity' presented by a new Immigration and Naturalization Service policy to increase the pace of naturalization. Daniel Solis wrote, `The people stuck in Chicago's naturalization bottleneck represent thousands of potential voters.' He added that `similar backlogs exist in politically important States' like California and Texas. 
We know the Vice President's office initiated a program called Reinventing Citizenship USA. We know the Vice President's office became involved in this project. A senior advisor to Vice President Gore sent an e-mail to a gentleman by the name of Dough Farbrother, another Gore aide, in March of 1996. Mr. Farbrother, being another Vice Presidential aide, received the memo in 1996, and that memo stated, `The President is sick of this and wants action.' 
We know that in a later message to the Vice President, Mr. Farbrother said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is not doing enough to `produce a million new citizens before election day.' 
He concluded that, `Unless we blast INS headquarters loose from their grip on the front line managers, we are going to have way too many people still waiting for citizenship in November.' 
We know that Mr. Farbrother later drafted a memo to President Clinton on behalf of Vice President Gore, which stated that `if we are too aggressive in removing the roadblocks to success, we might be publicly criticized for running a pro-Democrat voter mill and even having Congress stop us.' 
We know that as a result of these efforts 180,000 people were processed without criminal background checks. Clearly, the standards of citizenship were bent and broken for political purposes. 
Mr. President, in the middle of all this political activity at the White House, designed to influence the Presidential election, Vice President Gore made the following statement: `The ethical standards established in this White House have been the highest in the history of the White House. You have a tougher code of ethics, tougher requirements, strictly abided by.' When that statement was made last year, it was barely credible. Today, that statement is offensive and outrageous. Evidence piles upon evidence of legal and ethical wrongdoing in the Clinton administration. 
Mr. President, each day, it seems, either the New York Times, or the Washington Post, or the Wall Street Journal, or other major, credible investigative organizations, detail new improper or illegal activity, or both, coming out of this administration, related to the campaign financing operation run in the White House during the last election. As a consequence of this, I believe we are forced to three conclusions by this unfolding scandal. First, the White House, in preparation for the election, was turned into a political machine--more like Tammany Hall than the most ethical White House in history. The staff of the President, the staff of the Vice President, the First Lady, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and even the CIA were all involved. We are not sure exactly what the direct involvement was of the President. We know the Vice President, who was referred to as `solicitor in chief,' was a key player in all of this, in one way or another, Mr. President, with fundraising or increasing the number of Democrat voters. There was even use of the CIA in the operation to fund this election, which was conducted in an unprecedented and extraordinary and very disturbing way. Clearly, all the advantages of the executive branch were employed in the President's reelection effort. 
Mr. President, there is something deeply disturbing and inherently troubling about all of this. In a democracy, we prevent public officials from using their public office to improperly influence the outcome of elections because such practices are, perhaps, the most serious form of corruption in a democracy. 
The second conclusion from all of this is that the return of illegal money by the Democrat National Committee comes after the benefits that it bought, after the election is past and after the damage is done. In reality, the money raised by Johnny Huang and others cannot be returned because it has already been used. The DNC will simply raise new money, which is then refunded. We must not fool ourselves that returning illegal money is sufficient punishment, or any kind of punishment at all. It turns illegal funds into a campaign loan to be repaid after the votes are counted. And now it is unclear just when that loan will ever be repaid, because despite public announcements that the DNC is returning illegal contributions, not a penny--at least a reported penny--has yet been returned. 
Finally, this unfolding story of the White House improperly influencing the result of the national election is not politics as usual, as is so often alleged by the White House in response to each new allegation. This is something unique and something uniquely disturbing. This administration wants us to believe that its actions, if questionable, were normal practice, but we must never, Mr. President, become immune to illegality. This record of broken trust and broken rules does not primarily indicate the need 
for campaign finance reform; it indicates the need for further FBI investigation. It indicates the need for immediate firings in the White House. It may indicate the need for criminal prosecutions. It certainly indicates the need for independent counsel. 
Every time the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, or other publication reports a new aspect of this scandal, the same response comes back from the White House: `Republicans are being partisan. This is just politics. We all do it, so let's clean up the mess together.' 
No one at the White House, in any context, seems willing to take responsibility for ethical and legal violations. If the White House will not assume that responsibility, then it must be imposed. Senator Thompson's committee will doubtlessly do good work, but its results will almost certainly be attacked and discounted by the Clinton administration as simply `partisan politics.' I supported the effort to allow that committee to move forward in its investigation. But it is clear that the pattern of response from the White House now that whatever is said either by this Senator on this floor, or any Republican on this floor, or any Republican in a public statement, or conducted by any committee controlled by a Republican chairman--it's clear now that every question asked, every allegation made, and every statement offered is simply labeled as `partisan politics.' 
For that reason, it seems that in the end, we have no choice but to proceed with independent counsel. While far from perfect--and I have had my reservations about independent prosecutors--such a process, however, was designed to move questions of criminality outside the political process. And those questions of criminality in this case are serious questions--as serious as it gets--and may reach to the very highest levels of our Government. 
This administration has maintained its power, but has squandered its integrity. It has actively undermined the integrity of an American Presidential election. This is a breathtaking act of political arrogance. Yet, the President insists it was justified because, in his words, `The direction of the country was at stake.' 
I wonder what the public response would have been, Mr. President, if during the Watergate investigation of then President Nixon the response from the President, the response from the Vice President, and the response from the administration had been that all the means that we took, all the things that we engaged in were justified because our political agenda and the direction of our country was at stake. 
To overlook virtually every questionable, improper, illegal practice, and to overlook this 14 pages of what we know--who knows what we don't know?--and simply say that it was justified on the basis that the agenda of this administration was so important that any law could be violated, that any ethics rule could be overlooked, that any practice could be undertaken, simply to advance their political agenda for the future of America, puts this country in a dangerous, dangerous situation. 
The ends do not justify the means. While the President and his party feel strongly about what the agenda should be for this country, it is clear that there are opposing agendas that are debated every day on the Senate floor and in the Congress, and debated among the American people. 
It is political arrogance to suggest that one party's political agenda for the future of this country justifies the kinds of campaign practices that took place in the reelection effort of this President. 
The White House for years has chosen its own direction. That direction appears to be the corruption of the very democratic process itself. 
Mr. President, I believe this situation has become so serious and so potentially threatening, and damaging to the political process and to the office of the Presidency that an independent counsel is needed, and needed immediately. I, therefore, will join with many here in this body in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling upon the Attorney General to immediately name an independent counsel, someone who is above reproach, whose credibility is acceptable to the American people, whose integrity is unquestioned, to investigate the extraordinary serious allegations printed in major newspapers with great credibility. Just reading the quotes alone from memos obtained regarding some of these practices raises enough question I believe for the appointment of an independent counsel. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. Clearly the administration and the White House has decided to follow the course of labeling every charge as simply a partisan attack, equating campaign financing in the last congressional election with what took place at the White House--and they are leagues apart in terms of degree--attempting to confuse the issue with phrases like `Mistakes were made'; `We promise we won't do it again, even though we are proud of what we have done.' The phrases and comments that seem to indicate that we are all in the same pot together on this one; `You guys did it. We did it. Let's put behind us what was done and move forward to clean up the system.' 
I think it is time people began to take responsibility for their own actions. Since the White House refuses to do this, I think it is appropriate that we move forward with independent counsel. I will be supporting the resolution to be voted on tomorrow. 
Mr. President, if I have any time left, I yield that time. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there are two items I will address this morning. I will not be long. I know the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is waiting to speak.

Mr. COATS. This coming Wednesday, Mr. President, March 19, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act. This act was passed by this Senate in the last Congress by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 84-16. The previous Senator talked of cooperation between parties, and there certainly was a significant degree of cooperation on this issue. We worked on a bipartisan basis, securing 84 votes for its passage. Eventually, Congress passed the act as part of the historic telecommunications reform legislation. 
The Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress by an overwhelming, bipartisan margin, and signed by the President, simply extends the principle that exists in every other medium of communication in our society, a principle which has been repeatedly upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. 
Stated simply, this principle holds that it is the responsibility of the person who provides material deemed pornographic, that it is that person's responsibility to restrict access by minors to that material. The foundation of the principle is articulated clearly in the case New York versus Ferber, and I quote from that case: `It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that the State's interest in `safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor' is compelling.' Let me repeat that judicial decision again, New York versus Ferber. `It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that the State's interest in `safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor' is compelling.' 
This principle of compelling interest is the basis on which the Communications Decency Act was constructed. That is why we believe it is constitutional and the Court will hold it so after it hears the arguments next Wednesday. There is a long history of court decisions which recognize the interest of the State in safeguarding the psychological and physical well-being of minors. Mr. President, I have a copy of a brief in support of the Communications Decency Act. It was filed by a number of organizations: Enough is Enough, the Salvation Army, the National Political Congress of Black Women, the National Council of Catholic Women, Victims Assistance Legal Organization, Childhelp USA, Legal Pad Enterprises, Inc., Focus on the Family, the National Coalition for the Preservation of Family, Children and Family, Citizens for Family Friendly Libraries, Computer Power Corp., Help Us Regain the Children Organization--I am just reading some of these here--Mothers Against Sexual Abuse, National Association of Evangelicals, One Voice/American Coalition for Abuse Awareness, Religious Alliance Against Pornography, Lenore J. Weitzman, Ph.D., and so forth, a whole series of groups that have filed this brief. I commend these organizations for their leadership. I will be drawing on some of their comments in the brief during my remarks. 
Mr. President, it is now beyond question that exposure to pornography harms children. A child's sexual development occurs gradually throughout childhood. Exposure to pornography, particularly the type of hard-core pornography currently available on the Internet, distorts the natural sexual development of children. Essentially, pornography shapes children's sexual perspective by providing them distorted information on sexual activity. The type of information provided by pornography does not provide children with a normal sexual perspective. 
As stated in the brief, pornography portrays unhealthy or antisocial kinds of sexual activity such as sadomasochism, abuse, and humiliation of females, involvement of children, incest, voyeurism, bestiality, torture, objectification and is readily available on the Internet. 
The Communications Decency Act is designed, as I said, to employ the same restrictions that are currently employed, and have been held constitutional, in every other medium of communication. 
Why do we need these protections? Let me quote Ann Burgess, professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, when she states that children generally do not have a natural sexual capacity until the ages of 10 or 12, but pornography unnaturally accelerates that development. By short-circuiting the normal development process and supplying misinformation about their own sexuality, pornography leaves children confused, changed, and damaged. 
Mr. President, this is not what the Congress wants. This is not what the American people want. We expressed that in our debate and in our vote in the last Congress. Surely we have not come to a point in our society where we find it tolerable that any pornographer with a computer and a modem can crawl inside our children's minds and distort and corrupt their sexual development? 
As if the psychological threat of pornography doesn't present a sufficient compelling interest, there is also a significant physical threat. As I have stated, pornography develops in children a distorted sexual perspective. It encourages irresponsible, dehumanized sexual behavior, conduct that presents a genuine physical threat to children. In the United States today, about one in four sexually active teenagers acquire a sexually transmitted disease every year, resulting in 3 million sexually transmitted disease cases. Infectious syphilis rates have more than doubled among teenagers since the mideighties. One million American teenage girls become pregnant each year. A report entitled `Exposure to Pornography, Character and Sexual Deviance,' concluded that as more and more children become exposed not only to soft-core pornography, but also to explicit deviant sexual material, society's youth will learn an extremely dangerous message: Sex without responsibility is acceptable. 
Mr. President, it is clear that early exposure to pornography presents a disturbing psychological threat to children and a disturbing physical threat. However, there is a darker and even more ominous threat, for research has established a direct link between exposure and consumption of pornography and sexual assault, rape, and molesting of children. 
As stated in a publication called, `Aggressive Erotica and Violence Against Women,' virtually all lab studies established a causal link between violent pornography and the commission of violence. This relationship is not seriously debated any longer in the research community. What is more, pedophiles will often use pornographic material to desensitize children to sexual activity, breaking down their resistance in order to sexually exploit them. 
A study by Victor Cline found that child molesters often use pornography to seduce their prey, to lower the inhibitions of the victim, and as an instruction manual. Further, a W.L. Marshal study found that `87 percent of female child molesters and 77 percent of male child molesters studied admitted to regular use of hard-core pornography.' 
Mr. President, all you have to do is pick up the telephone and call the FBI, ask their child exploitation task force about the volume of over-the-Internet attempts to seduce, abuse, and lure children into pornography and sexual exploitation. 
I could go on and on, Mr. President, citing these studies, but there is really no need to do that. The evidence is clear. The compelling interest of the Government in restricting children's access to pornography is beyond credible dispute, both morally and legally. 
The Communications Decency Act is a narrowly tailored law, designed to protect children from the pornography that is so widely available and easily accessed on the Internet. As I have said, it is a simple extension of the constitutional restrictions on such material that exist today in every other communications medium in our society. 
The Communications Decency Act provides for the prosecution of those who utilize an interactive computer device to send indecent material to a child or uses an interactive computer device to display indecent material in a manner easily accessible to a child. 
In addition, the Communications Decency Act encourages blocking software and other technologies by providing good-faith defenses designed to protect the good Samaritan attempting to block or screen pornographic material. 
However, ultimately, it preserves the constitutionally established principle that pornography should be walled off from our children. To overturn the Communications Decency Act would represent a fundamental shift in paradigm, throwing our children into a hostile sea of pornography that threatens their psychological and physical well-being. I am confident that the Court will not be so callous with the basic well-being of our children.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of the Senate to an article that appeared in the March 13 edition of the Washington Post, headlined, `President Won't Back CPI Panel.' This article discusses President Clinton's decision to not go forward with establishing an independent panel to examine the cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other Federal benefits. I think that is an unfortunate development because, clearly, there is bipartisan support for that effort. Members of both the Republican and Democrat Parties are on record and have made public statements saying that they believe this effort ought to go forward, whether it is an effort undertaken by a commission, or whether it is something that we engage in ourselves or ask the executive branch to do by Executive order. 
Clearly, we are faced with a situation where we have to step forward, to lead, to address one of the most fundamental of all structural reforms necessary to curb the unchecked growth of entitlements. 
Beginning with his State of the Union Address, the President has been telling the Congress and the American public of his desire to sit down and work out a solution to the coming entitlement crisis, and we have responded on our side by saying that we are willing to do this. In fact, in our budget last year, we recommended and voted for doing this. But now it seems obvious that, for some reason, the administration, the President and his party--and, frankly, a number of interest groups who have so much influence among those who oppose entitlement reform--plan to return to the same kind of rhetoric on Medicare and Social Security, and the same political tactics that serve to undermine the very health of the programs that they purport to protect. 
Well, we don't have to go very far, Mr. President, to find out what the intention of the President and his party is in this regard, thanks to a former assistant to the President, Mr. Harold Ickes. In a pile of documents that Mr. Ickes recently submitted to the House committee investigating illegal activities at the White House, there was a revealing memo. 
Rich Lowry, of the New Republic, recently reported that a February 1995 memo that Mr. Ickes sent to the President included `a proposed direct mail appeal to be sent by the Democratic National Committee over [the chairman's] signature, focusing on the Republican proposal to recalculate the inflation rate, thereby reducing COLA payments on Social Security benefits.' 
The memo then goes on to provide a draft of the proposed letter giving some insight into the scare tactics that have been the signature of the DNC, the President, and organizations like the AARP, which refers to the CPI fix as `a cowardly, back-door political gimmick to take tens of billions of dollars out of the pockets of senior citizens.' 
This is familiar verbiage and familiar rhetoric. We have seen it now in campaign after campaign over the last decade. We heard it in last year's Medicare reform debate. 
The letter goes on to say, `If the Republicans can force the Federal Government to lower its estimate of inflation, then they can dramatically reduce the cost-of-living-adjustments received by every Social Security recipient in America.' 
I ask, where is the bipartisanship in this statement? It is hardly a reference to what the President has been saying in terms of sitting down and working together to address a very real problem. And it is hardly an indication of how we had hoped to move forward addressing some of the serious problems in the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security system. One has to question how serious the President, and his party, really are about meaningful entitlement reform if they intend to continue to frighten seniors rather than honestly addressing the problem. 
Mr. Ickes' proposed fundraising letter goes on to state, `We cannot remain silent while the new Congress finances another round of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans by reducing the hard-earned benefits received by older Americans.' The letter provides a preprepared petition to be sent to the then majority leader, Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich saying, `I am outraged at the Republican plan to use phony inflation estimates to reduce the Social Security COLA's of America's senior citizens.' 
So the question here is, Is the President of the United States willing to step apart from the recommendations and rhetoric of his own party? Is he willing to step forward and provide leadership, as I think any President should, particularly when not facing reelection, on one of the most fundamental problems that we have as a nation and agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run? In President Clinton's State of the Union Address to the Congress, the President said, `We must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run . . .' And Republicans, who had just been hammered to death over proposing that very same concept a year before, said, `Well, the problem is big enough that you are right. We ought to do that. Even though we may have a right to feel pretty bitter about how that effort was used against us electorally, we think it is important enough for this Nation that we ought to go ahead. So we will reach out in a bipartisan fashion.' 
So it is extremely disappointing to read here--I hope it is wrong but I think it is correct--that the President has abandoned his efforts at providing leadership for structural reforms within the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. But the President is not alone in his cynical attempt to scare our senior citizens. 
I want to conclude my remarks by addressing another institution that has undermined our ability to accomplish what everybody knows we need to accomplish. No group has played a more destructive nor a more deceptive role in entitlement reform than the American Association of Retired Persons, known as the AARP. We know the AARP is that wonderful organization that only charges I think $8 to join once you reach the age of 50. I must admit I was a little shocked when I got my first mailing from the AARP. I think I was 45 when the first mailing came saying you are approaching senility here, and you had better join our group. I said, `I am not old enough for this. I thought retirement was 65 and over.' But the AARP has wisely, from a financial standpoint, reached down and convinced people that at the age of 50 and lower they can take advantage of the benefits offered to the AARP. I am not ready to concede that I am ready for those benefits, although they are pretty attractive. For that 8 bucks you get access to all 
kinds of things. 
But the problem is that on the issue most fundamental to the future of this country and to the future of senior citizens--Medicare and Social Security--the AARP takes a totally disingenuous, plays a totally deceptive role, a destructive role in terms of our ability to try to preserve those trust funds for future users and future beneficiaries. 
We know that a train wreck is coming on entitlements. How do we know that? We know that because the board of trustees that included, at the time, three members of the President's Cabinet told us that this train wreck was coming. They told us that there is an urgent problem that we need to address on a bipartisan basis. And they told us that we cannot be prey to the political ranting and raving of self-serving organizations like the AARP. Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Reich, then Secretary of Labor, Donna Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Shirley Chater, the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Acting Principal Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, told us, `Folks, there is a train wreck coming. You have your head in the sand. You are letting political demagoguery deter you from doing what you have to do. If you want to preserve Social Security, if you want to preserve Medicare and the benefits in Medicare, you have to get hold of this out-of-control entitlement process.' We all know that. 
Medicare part A is scheduled to be bankrupt--bankrupt--by the year 2002. The Social Security trust fund will begin running a deficit at 2013 and collapse by 2029. 
That is not political rhetoric. Those are the conclusions of a distinguished panel of trustees that studied the system. And it comes out of this administration. It is not a group of Republican conservatives trying to kneecap the Social Security system. These are responsible people appointed by the President to serve on this panel. They are his own people. Yet, we go careening from election to election totally ignoring these warnings, knowing that somebody is going to have to pay an enormous price in the future, knowing that we are undermining the very system that we say we are trying to preserve. 
And the group that is most responsible for putting pressure on us, politically demagoging this issue, is the American Association of Retired Persons. They continue to tell their members that there is nothing wrong with Social Security, that there is nothing wrong with Medicare, that there is no crisis. They continue to press Congress to block any solution. The AARP, the second-largest nonprofit organization in America, second only to the Catholic church, has a staff of 1,700 people funded by the dues of 33 million members along with $191 million in profits earned through the sale of insurance policies, mutual funds, mail-order pharmaceuticals, automobile rentals, automobile club memberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel room discount packages, and so forth. That is OK. I am glad they are in that business. I am glad they are providing those benefits to the seniors. Their expressed purpose is to serve the needs and interests of our Nation's elderly. 
But, Mr. President, the only thing we hear up here from the AARP, other than requests for membership dues, is, if we dare even speak about addressing the problems of Medicare and Social Security, they are going to go after us politically. 
Now we have this looming disaster with Medicare and Social Security. Once again, the AARP is joining hands with those who oppose the system to terrorize our Nation's seniors. 
In a recent Insight magazine article, Horace Deets, the AARP's executive director, is quoted as saying: `Social Security has worked well for 60 years, and there is no reason to believe that it is on the verge of bankruptcy . . . Social Security continues to work efficiently and effectively . . . Social Security does work.' Where has Mr. Deets been? What does this man read? Has he read the trustees' report? Has he read this impressive document that has looked into this on an actuarially sound basis? 
Has he read the recommendations and conclusions that the whole thing is to come a cropper, that the very people he represents are going to be hurt badly unless we do something now, that we are heading for a train wreck? 
I think maybe Mr. Deets should spend less time trying to collect dues from people and take a little time to read the trustees report on the future of Social Security and join us in a responsible effort which the trustees say will hurt less if we do it now, but is going to hurt greatly if we wait until later. 
We cannot afford to wait. We cannot afford to pretend there is nothing wrong when everybody knows that is not the case. The changes we make now could be phased in over a period of time and would have minimal impact. But if we wait and follow Mr. Deets' advice, keep our head in the sand and pretend that there is no problem, it is going to come as a great shock and a great surprise to the 33 million people who rely on their AARP mailings when they find out that their own organization has led them down a blind ally, their own organization has sold them out, sold out to a political process that goes against the very best interests of their members. 
Mr. President, I am disappointed by the action of the President. I am disappointed but not surprised. As a recent Washington Post editorial stated, you believe this White House `at your peril.' With the AARP driving the politics and the decisions of the President and his party, I am sure we can anticipate even more fear mongering on entitlement reform. But ultimately we are going to have to find solutions to these problems. I fear that this difficult process will be made even more complicated by an unprincipled and a timid administration and a deceitful and self-serving American Association of Retired Persons. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.  
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this past Thursday the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the current television rating system. I want to commend Senator McCain for calling that hearing. It was very instructional for all of us. What was apparent from that hearing is the near universal dissatisfaction with the current Hollywood rating system, the need for immediate change, the utter failure of the industry to understand what parents want in a rating system, and the basic responsibility that goes with using publicly owned broadcast spectrum. 
Mr. President, we are beyond debate regarding the influence of television programming on children, particularly the most vulnerable of our children, growing up in single-parent homes or homes where the demand of work keep parents away and children unsupervised for long hours. This is, unfortunately, an increasing norm in our society. 
It was a combination of these facts and the increasingly violent and explicit nature of television programming that produced the `V' chip legislation that passed last year and the demand for ratings that empower parents with content information so that they can exercise control over the type of television programming invading their households and their children's minds that they believe is inappropriate. 
I call attention to the 1995 study of children age 10 to 16 conducted by the Los Angeles polling firm of Fairbank, Maslin, Maulin & Associates. In that poll, one-third of the children stated they would like to try what they see others doing on television; two-thirds stated that their peers are influenced by what they see on TV; 65 percent said programming like the Simpsons encouraged them to disrespect their parents; and an alarming 62 percent said that sex portrayed on television influences kids to have sex when they are too young. These are the results of the study of children 10 to 16. These are their responses to the questions that were asked by the poll. 
Upon hearing the results of this poll, entertainer Steve Allen told editorialist Cal Thomas, `My first reaction is that we should take this information and beat (network TV executives) over the head with it.' I think some of last week's hearing, for those who tuned in and those who were there, may have had the same effect, because there was universal, near universal, dissatisfaction with the efforts, lack of effort, made by the broadcasters, Hollywood producers and others to address some of these fundamental questions. That was a bipartisan response not confined to any one particular party. 
Unfortunately, the system offered by the television industry to address this is critically flawed. There are two fatal problems with the system. First is the fact that the system does not provide program-specific, content-based information. This is the critical point. 
The Hollywood ratings system adopted by the television industry essentially hides the true content of programs behind a generic rating that suggests to parents what may be in a program--I say what `may be' in a program, not what actually is in a program. Take the TV `PG' rating, which 61 percent of current television programs receive. In a 52-word explanation of this rating, it is stated: `This program may contain infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive dialog and situations.' 
Mr. President, I suggest that telling a parent what a 
program `may' include does not tell them very much. I ask, what would be so difficult, what is so hard about simply substituting the word `does' for the word `may.' The program `does' contain infrequent coarse language. The program `does' contain limited violence. This program `does' contain some suggestive dialog and situations. In addition, why not provide parents with an audible explanation of content just prior to airing the programming and stating the information clearly and prominently on the screen. 
The second fatal flaw in the current system proposed by Hollywood and adopted by the broadcasters is there is no standard format for how ratings are arrived at. In other words, each station or channel uses their own methods and priorities in assigning ratings. Fox uses one method, NBC another and so on. What is recommended as a standardized system to parents is, in fact, completely unique from station to station, channel to channel. In other words, it a rating in search of a meaning. 
The Hollywood system designed by the Motion Producers Association head Jack Valenti was created to avoid giving parents information on the content of programs. I do not think you can come to any other conclusion. It is so confusing, it is so imprecise, I think you have to conclude that it was designed not to give specific information. Why? Well, clearly, I think they were concerned about advertisers not wanting to advertise on programs that included offensive language. Ultimately, it is the parents who turn off the sets, or the sets that are turned off because of the contents of programs, that will determine where those advertising dollars flow. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to make sure that we all understand that we cannot and we should not be censors, but that our society depends on informed choices. We need to provide informed information and informed choices for parents. To do that requires information which the current Hollywood-Valenti rating system refuses to give. 
It had been my hope that the television industry would be responsive to the public outcry against their age-based rating system. Polls conducted in response to the industry proposal by the PTA/Institute for Mental Health Initiatives demonstrated that 80 percent of parents desire a content-based system and a Media Study Center poll found similar results. Ask any parent, ask any parent what they need in order to make a determination on what they think their children should watch, and they say tell us what is in it. Do not give us some rating scheme where we do not know what it relates to, that is not standardized, that changes from station to station. Just tell us what is there. 
Unfortunately, the industry has not simply ignored the American public; it has defied them. Mr. Valenti, the architect and the cheerleader for the current system, claims the system must be simple so that parents can understand it. Must be simple? Parents can understand it? The TV-Y rating requires a 47-word explanation; TV-Y7 requires 73 words to explain what it means; TV-14, 61 words. All of these ratings explanations are riddled with ambiguity. The only thing easy to understand about these ratings is who came up with them and why. 
The system is not profamily, it is pro-Hollywood. It is designed to protect the Hollywood production houses. It is designed to protect advertisers who, confronted with content-specific ratings, would shun programs that include explicit material. 
Now, supposedly there was some miraculous coming together of television executives and Hollywood for a commonsense rating of programs. 
Well, I think there has been some confusion here in the statement that they have refused to change, regardless of what the public wants. Now, thankfully, under the pressure of the congressional investigation, the congressional hearing, and the outpouring of outrage and frustration and dissatisfaction and disgust with the current system, there have been expressions that, yes, the industry is willing to take another look at this. I hope they not only take another look, but that they will do it quickly and do it effectively, because the industry doesn't own the broadcast spectrum, the public owns the broadcast spectrum. And because the public owns the spectrum, I think it is reasonable to ask that those who use the spectrum be responsive to the public's requests--again, not for censorship, but simply for information so they can make decisions about what is appropriate and not appropriate for their children to watch. Therefore, I think combining the request for granting or renewal of a license to broadcast on that spectrum is a reasonable thing to ask for in return for a content-based, program-specific rating system. In other words, if you want to use the public spectrum, if you have a responsibility--and the responsibility is to provide parents with information. 
I, therefore, am introducing legislation today that will ensure that the changes the American people demand as a condition for license renewal, for license granting, or for loan of spectrum for the transition of digital broadcast--in return for that, we get broadcaster consent to accurately label their programming. I don't create a Government rating system. I simply want to put some information in the hands of parents. 
The spectrum that is going to be loaned to broadcasters for digital transmission is extremely valuable. This resource also belongs to the American public, a public that overwhelmingly supports a program-specific, content-based rating system. The basic criteria for issuing a broadcast license is service of the public good. If a broadcaster can't comply with the basic will of the American people, by accurately labeling the product they seek to provide, on the taxpayers' spectrum, then I don't believe they deserve, nor should they receive, the precious resource of broadcast spectrum. 
Mr. President, we cannot use Government to force more family-friendly programming--as much as sometimes I wish we could, given what we currently see. 
Mr. President, we can empower parents with information that they need to guide their children's viewing habits. In doing so, we empower them to send a message to the networks, and television advertisers to stop the onslaught of the kind of programming that flows through our television sets into the minds of our children. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, let me just say that in this age where it's harder and harder to protect children from information and from behavior and from activities in our society that is damaging not only to their bodies, but to their minds and souls, the parents need tools; they are crying out for weapons and tools to fight back against this onslaught of a hostile culture. They want to try to protect the innocence of their children--even if just for a little while. I think they have every right to demand the tool of accurate and responsible television ratings in return for the use of the public broadcast system. 
My legislation would ensure this end. I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this effort. With that, I send to the desk the legislation designed to accomplish this very purpose.

Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Madam President, what message does it send to the American people when we vote `no' on the balanced budget amendment? 
First, it says that Congress prefers its own judgment over the judgment of the people. This is not a vote to enact the balanced budget amendment. This is a vote to send it to the people to see if they want a balanced budget amendment. Why should we put our judgment ahead of the people? 
Second, it is an exercise in political power that says that political power is more important than the desires of the people. Clearly, 80 percent of the American people have said they want fiscal responsibility and believe it can only be achieved through a balanced budget amendment. 
Third, it continues a system that allows us to vote public benefits to the very people who keep us in office while placing the burden of paying for those benefits on people who cannot vote for us. Therefore, it gives us the natural inclination to vote for those benefits and pass on the obligations to people in the future. 
Finally, we avoid the moral tradition of sacrificing for posterity. Instead, we ask posterity to sacrifice for us. That is wrong. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, over the last 15 years, the balanced budget amendment has been debated over and over again in this Chamber. Members of one or both Chambers of Congress actually have voted on this proposal six times. The arguments, by this point, are familiar. We have heard them over the last several weeks and the last several years in these debates. So there is the disturbing process by which the vested interests of this institution are protected against the clear will of our democracy. 
We are not, of course, debating about passage of a balanced budget amendment. We are debating whether or not to send that decision to the States and to the people of America. Often that gets confused. People think that the entire decision, the entire vote, rests with the 100 Members of this Senate body, 
when in fact the only thing that rests with us is whether or not we will make the decision to give the people of America, to give democracy, an opportunity to decide whether or not we ought to have a balanced budget directing our fiscal affairs here in Washington. 
We are debating whether to prefer our interests above their wisdom, and it appears we will once again by the narrowest of margins decide to sustain this corrupt and corrupting Federal power of unlimited debt. 
Once again our debate on this matter has been conducted to maximize public cynicism--not intentionally but that is certainly the result--with twisted arms, violated promises, pressure tactics, and broken commitments. We have seen it all surround this issue time and time again. And, once again, as we are debating this, people are switching their position, people pledging to their constituents during the campaign: `I will be there when the balanced budget call is taken; when the roll is called, I will be on the plus side.' And, of course, now we hear the excuses as to why since the election is over that is no longer the case. Even those who have voted for the balanced budget amendment in the past now find convenient reasons not to do so in the present. 
So I guess we cannot really blame the American people for being cynical, for being apathetic about what takes place here in this body, in the Congress, in Washington. All of this in a desperate attempt to prevent the American citizen from having a voice and having a vote, all to prop up, if just for a few more years, the ability of Congress to cripple the success and the prosperity of the future. 
There are many divisive issues debated in this Chamber, but this issue is unique in one way. The defeat of a balanced budget amendment represents the raw exercise of political power against the desires of over 80 percent of the American public. In my experience in politics, no proposal with support so strong and so consistent has ever been frustrated for so long by the Congress. 
Make no mistake. A balanced budget amendment will eventually be sent to the States for ratification. I think that is guaranteed by the breadth of public commitment which will not go away and will only grow in strength. We can delay this process, as apparently we will do once again, but not deny it. Every year of delay increases our danger and ought to add to our shame and guilt. 
Rather than rehearse the detailed arguments of this debate, let me take, if I could, a long review of what I think we have learned. First, the history of the last few decades and the nature of the political process itself argues that the Congress is incapable of self-restraint. We have a system in place, a system that allows us to vote public benefits to the very people who keep us in office. We have a system that allows us to place the burden of those benefits on the future while we gain political support from the present. We have found an efficient way to betray future generations in favor of the present. And it is easy and relatively painless because our generation can vote while future generations cannot and our silence and their anger is distant. We do not feel or hear their anger at the next election because they do not have a vote at the next election. So we please those who benefit us now at the expense of those in the future. 
The only thing we sacrifice in this process--Mr. President, I would say it is a great sacrifice--is our integrity and our historical reputation. In a distortion of the Constitution, we promote the general welfare for ourselves at the expense of our posterity. As it stands, there is no weight on the other side of this balance. There is no reliable check on this process of intergenerational theft. It is politically prudent, even popular, and this political calculation will not change, will never permanently change without some kind of systematic institutional counterweight, without some measure to give posterity a voice in our affairs. Nothing, in my view, will permanently change until the accumulation of popular debt is a violation of our oath to the Constitution. Perverse incentives of the current system will not be altered until the system itself is altered, until our political interests are balanced by the weighty words of a constitutional amendment. 
The second lesson I believe we have learned in the last few decades is that despite all the talk we hear in Congress, despite all the posturing, despite all the rhetoric, we are simply ignoring the coming entitlement crisis. We are not facing up to the hard question. We have chosen cheerful oblivion over public responsibility. The train wreck is a precise, measurable distance away. Trustees predict that the Medicare part A will be bankrupt by the year 2002. Trustees of Social Security believe that the system will begin to run a deficit in 2013 and could collapse by 2029. 
Former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson recently wrote that if entitlements are not reformed, the cost of Social Security and Medicare by the year 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's paycheck. It is a crisis propelled by demographics and propelled by Federal irresponsibility. Every 
year we avoid real reform we make real reform more painful. 
Oh, and the attitude here is, well, 2002, 2013, 2029, I will probably be out of office by then, or hopefully something will change by then, or let us not think beyond 1998. That is the next election, isn't it. Let us see what we can do to slip by one more election. But it is always one more election, one more election, one more election. 
When I came here in 1980, we were charged with the responsibility of dealing with deficit spending. We were charged with the responsibility of getting a handle on the entitlements and being straightforward and real with the American people, but each time it slipped one more election, one more election, one more election. Now we are looking at 1998. 
There does not appear to be any movement out of this administration to address entitlements in a serious structural way--some tinkering at the edges suggesting but not proffered, some concerns about the political implications of making the hard choices, making the difficult decisions, but nothing concrete before us as a body. And so we will pass again for 2 more years. 
Opponents of the balanced budget amendment talk a great deal about Social Security, but they do not talk about solving its most fundamental problems. Instead, their efforts are designed to move it off budget, creating the illusion that this action will somehow save the system. 
This is a distraction, as I think everyone in this Chamber knows. It is not a solution. It is a distraction from the fact that our current budget rules are deceptive. We are borrowing from the Social Security trust fund and replacing real money with T-bills. There is not some giant pot of money out here waiting for Social Security recipients. It is a pay-as-you-go system. Some have called it the ultimate pyramid system. We are borrowing from it and putting pieces of paper into it to pay it back someday. That payback has to come from the general revenue. Those T-bills are a promise to pay benefits in the future, yet this borrowing is not reflected in our deficit calculations each year. 
As a matter of budgeting integrity, we should stop the shell game. We need an accurate accounting of the yearly deficit and the Federal debt. In fiscal 1996, we reported a budget deficit of $107 billion, but we failed to report an additional $66 billion borrowed from and owed to Social Security. Where does that money come from? It comes from the American taxpayer. It comes from taxes imposed against their paychecks. It is money that is going to have to be paid back. 
To say we can solve this problem by conveniently taking it off budget is a shell game. It is a deception of the American people. What it really amounts to is keeping two sets of books. These kinds of budget tricks make the job of balancing the budget easier in the short term--and of course it is the short term here that everyone is concerned about, the next election-- but they compound the problems of future generations. 
I urge my colleagues to put aside this phony debate over Social Security. It is impossible to disentangle Social Security revenues and expenditures from the budget. Congress should address the national debt by passing the balanced budget amendment and then turn quickly to real solutions, real reform of Social Security. 
It is unfortunate and it is undeniable that President Clinton's budget currently on the table understands none of these lessons, and actually deepens our problems. It is a symbol of the Federal Government's failure of will and nerve. 
When I came to the Congress in 1981, our total Federal debt was just under $1 trillion. In the plan the President submitted recently to this Congress, his budgets will contribute another $1 trillion to the debt before those budgets are supposed to come into balance. This is hardly an act of courage. In fact, the President's plan demands that nearly all the courage be shown by others, since it postpones real spending cuts until after he leaves office. Moreover, if the President's own optimistic estimates about future deficits do not prove accurate, he relies on triggers--automatic cuts in spending and increased taxes--to bring the budget into balance. All of this occurring, again, after he has left office, after he no longer will be held to account. 
Harry Truman's famous injunction, `the buck stops here,' apparently now reads: The buck stops at the desk of the next person to occupy this office. 
Now we will apparently learn from CBO later this week that even the President's budget numbers are not accurate. They are not even close. We will, in fact, be about $70 billion short of balance in 2002. This year's budgets alone will see a 20 percent increase in the deficit. 
This budget is the embodiment of the point I am trying to make. Deferring responsibility is easy. Shifting hard choices to the future is easy. Deficit spending is easy. Everybody plays the game unless a constitutional amendment changes the ground rules, unless fiscal discipline is imposed from above, not from within. Unless the system is changed, exposing and ending all of our tricks and excuses, that is the only way we can be honest with the American people. That is the only way we can end the cynicism toward our efforts here in the Congress, which are falling, I am afraid, ever more on deaf ears. 
There is a great deal at stake here. As others have argued at length, increasing debt has an economic cost in higher interest rates. For businesses, this means slowed or stalled expansion, and for families it means that buying that new house or sending that child to college becomes more difficult each year. 
Another cost is measured in lost opportunities to meet justified public needs. By fiscal year 1998, interest payments on the national debt will approach $250 billion--$250 billion in interest payments. That figure is 21 times more money on interest than on the entire Federal expenditure for agriculture; 17 times more than the entire Federal expenditures for international affairs; 11 times more than on natural resources and the environment combined; and 4 times more than on education, training, and employment. We stand on this floor and argue, and we work in committee, just to try to scratch a little bit more money out for job training, for education, to deal with problems of the environment and our natural resources, to deal with international affairs and pressing problems in agriculture. We try to scratch a few million dollars here, a few hundred million dollars there. Yet $250 billion simply goes to pay interest. 
What could we do with that $250 billion if we did not have to pay any interest? A big healthy return to the American people would be the first start, a big tax cut to give them back some more of their hard-earned money. And there may be priorities, there may be roads that need to be repaired or built, there may be education expenditures that are appropriate, there may be natural resource and environmental concerns that ought to be addressed, there may be agricultural items that ought to be funded, and a whole raft of other appropriate spending efforts. Yet those are squeezed ever more, as more and more of our budget goes to pay interest. 
Beyond this, there is a moral cost of continued debt, a 
price paid in the character of our Nation. I have quoted Thomas Jefferson in this debate before, but let me quote him once more. It is an injunction that this Congress has ignored time after time:  
The question of whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and be morally bound to pay for them by ourselves. 
Those were words of a great American a long time ago. I wonder what he would say today, looking at over $5.4 trillion of national debt and continuing budget deficits year after year after year after year. `We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and be morally bound to pay them ourselves,' said Thomas Jefferson, one of the most fundamental principles of government. 
In this debate we are accustomed to thinking in terms of dollars and cents. We should also be thinking in terms of right and wrong. It is simply wrong to accumulate power in the present by placing burdens on the future. And that is exactly what we are doing. We are accumulating power in the present, the power of spending, and the way we are doing it is placing burdens on the future. It is an important part of our moral tradition, to sacrifice for posterity. It is rank selfishness to demand that posterity sacrifice for us. And there is only one way to ensure that this strong and constant temptation is defeated, by making a balanced budget a fundamental institutional commitment of our Government. 
After 25 years of budget deficits, the call to voluntary restraint is hollow. Too many promises have been made and broken. Congress has spent the full measure of public trust. Meaningful budget restraint, if we find it, will come from above, not from within. This fundamental principle of government should be, and hopefully someday will be, and I predict it will be, in America's fundamental law. That day cannot come too soon. We should be ashamed if that process does not begin tomorrow. 
Tomorrow we will vote once again. Two years ago I sat in my seat, one row down, listening to the final debate on the balanced budget amendment, listening to the call of the roll. As every Senator sat at his or her desk, each stood to record his or her vote, and as we went through the roll we tallied the numbers and we stopped at 66. We came one vote short. One vote short, not of adopting a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, one vote short of exercising the right in a democracy of the people to determine that matter for themselves. It appears that we will stop one vote short again. I hope that is not the case. I pray that is not the case. 
We desperately need to arrest the power of the purse that has so corrupted our ability to represent the will of the people. I hope tomorrow we will demonstrate the courage to finally say: Power to the people. Let them decide the fiscal course for this Nation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to briefly address an item that was in the news this morning titled `New Study Faults Pentagon's Gay Policy.' This morning the New York Times reported that with great alarm. It seemed that 850 men and women were discharged last year from the military for being homosexuals. They talk about an alarming increase in the number of people discharged under this policy that the Congress enacted just a couple of years ago. 
First of all, we should put this in perspective. The 850 discharged amounts to six one-hundredths of 1 percent of active duty military personnel, and I do not think anybody on that basis can claim there is some kind of vendetta or witch hunt or anything else going on. It is really important for us to stand back and review where we are today following the debate that we had on gays in the military in 1994. 
First, it is important to understand that the U.S. military maintains a commitment, a consistent commitment to the principle that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. This conviction has been one that was more thoroughly investigated and examined than perhaps any other policy, at least controversial policy, that this Senate body has examined in my memory and in many people's memories. We held exhaustive hearings. We held field hearings. We brought in experts from every perspective from the left, the right, and everywhere in between. Regardless of what their philosophical position was, we gave people the opportunity to express their opinion on this issue. 
The evidence and the findings of fact that are laid out in the law itself that this Congress passed by a very substantial margin and which was signed by the President clearly demonstrated a factual basis and a rational basis for the policy that was adopted. The conviction is justified and, I think, clearly won the support of an overwhelming majority of both the House and the Senate and reaffirmed and signed into law and now has been reaffirmed into law. 
Now, I know there are some who still disagree with the conclusion that the Senate arrived at and that the Congress arrived at, but they presented their argument in a national debate. That argument did not prevail and did not come close to prevailing. They lost that argument because we were able to demonstrate, on a bipartisan basis, led by Senator Nunn and was something I participated in and many others, that clear, open homosexuality undermines unit cohesion and military effectiveness. It creates an unavoidable sexual tension, often in close quarters, which compromises the central purpose of the military, and that is to be effectively prepared to be able to fight and win wars if necessary or if called on. 
Second, the U.S. military defines homosexuality as it has always defined homosexuality. First, making a statement that you are a homosexual is a presumption, is a clear indication, that you have adopted a homosexual lifestyle and is grounds for discharge. Second, engaging in a homosexual act is prima facie evidence of the case that you are a homosexual as defined in the law. Third, entering into a homosexual marriage. Those are the criteria. 
In the public debate, people have tried to call this policy many different things, but in fact it is the policy the military held even before we passed the so-called don't ask, don't tell policy in 1994, and it is the policy we enforce today. So when military commanders implement this policy, they are not violating the rules. They are simply enforcing the law as we in the Congress wrote the law, supported the law, voted for the law, on a bipartisan basis, and as that law was accepted and signed into law by the President, the current President, of the United States.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will comment on another article in the New York Times which is titled, `An Abortion Rights Advocate Says He Lied About Procedure' of partial-birth abortions. 
Many here remember the very heated and controversial and difficult and emotional debate that we had on this floor in attempting to override the President's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill passed, again on a bipartisan basis, in both the Senate and the House but vetoed by the President on the grounds that this was a rare procedure, it rarely happened, and, therefore, we should not make a policy which would deny on those few rare occasions, as the President described them, the opportunity to women to avail themselves of a partial-birth abortion.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I didn't have the opportunity to respond to the Senator from California when she stated her willingness to reexamine the issue of partial-birth abortion. The minority leader was on the floor waiting to speak, and had reserved time for that. 
However, I would like to just say that, No. 1, I am pleased that they are willing to revisit the issue. It is an issue that I think deserve revisiting. 
I want to correct some information that might be misconstrued, as referenced by the Senator from California--the fact that, if we could just make sure that we provided an exception for women whose lives were in danger, were the procedure not proposed. As I think the Senator remembers, that was clearly addressed in the bill that was before the Senate last Congress--that exception for life of the mother was clearly stated in that language. Now this whole addition of the well health of the mother--first of all, as the Senator from Pennsylvania [Senator Santorum] so eloquently described, there were no instances, there were no partial-birth abortions performed to protect the health of the mother. There was a lot of erroneous misinformation discussed about that. And this has always been the reason why opponents--of whatever attempts are made to address the question of abortion from the pro-life side--it is always, `If we could just add the exception for health of the mother.' 
As we have learned over the years and as has been demonstrated in numerous court holdings and other information that is presented to us, health of the mother is so broadly defined. Are we talking about psychological health of the mother, emotional health of the mother? It has really just been used as an excuse to provide abortionists, doctors who perform abortions, a basis for simply saying we will use this exception to allow the abortion to go forward. 
I really think what we are dealing with here is a procedure that goes beyond the pale. It really, as many have said in the debate, is not an abortion issue. It is not a pro-choice abortion issue. This is the issue of a deliberate taking of life, of a fetus, of a baby that is well beyond the age of viability, however that is defined. My own personal belief is that life begins at conception. 
Even if you do not agree with my personal belief on this, there is no question that at the 5th, 6th and 7th month, the times when partial-birth abortions are performed, because the head of the child is so large it cannot be extracted through the birth canal and therefore has to be collapsed by the doctor after the baby is killed, there is no question that the partial-birth abortion issue is one that is not in the purview of what we generally have been talking about on the pro-life pro-choice issues. It is clearly a situation where we have a baby who, if born at that moment, would be able to sustain life. Someone said 3 inches and 3 seconds from being declared murder. 
I remember the situation when the young couple in New Jersey, I think it was, was arrested for the killing of their recently born baby. How ironic it is that had they gone to an abortionist and had a partial-birth abortion 1 minute before the baby was born and then they killed the baby, it would have been a perfectly accepted procedure without any criminal penalty, without any penalty whatsoever. And so we are talking about a human life that is capable of being sustained on its own that is deliberately ended, terminated, by an abortion doctor to provide for a more convenient abortion. 
That is what is at stake here. That is what the debate is going to have to be about if we bring it back up. I am pleased that the minority leader and the Senator from California, who was the primary opponent of our efforts to override the President's veto, I am pleased they want to revisit the issue, but let us revisit it on the right terms and let us know what we are talking about.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today to discuss an issue which is not pleasant. It is tragically controversial, and it is an unsavory topic. The issue is computer pornography. 
I have a copy of the February 10, 1997 U.S. News & World Report magazine. The cover story indicates, America is by far the world's leading producer of porn, churning out hard core videos at the astonishing rate of about 150 new titles per week. The magazine provides an inside look at the industry. 
Within this U.S. News & World Report edition is a lengthy article discussing the porn industry in the United States, shamefully pronouncing the United States as the world's leading producer of pornography. There is much in this article to shock, to disappoint, and to be ashamed of. But I am going to limit my remarks specifically to the issue of computer pornography. 
As a backdrop, let me quote from the article just to give us an idea of the scope of the problem. `Last year,' the article states, `Americans spent more than $8 billion on hard-core videos, peep shows, live sex acts, adult cable programming, sexual devices, computer porn, and sex magazines--an amount larger than Hollywood's domestic box office receipts and larger than all of the revenues generated by rock and country music recordings. Americans now spend more money at strip clubs than at Broadway, off-Broadway, regional, and nonprofit theaters; at the opera, the ballet, and jazz and classical music performances . . . combined.' 
That is the scope of the problem. It is a staggering statistic, one that ought to shock us all. 
The article also discusses the role of the Internet and the role of computer pornography in driving the technology that we have all become so aware of in just the last year or so. Let me again quote from the magazine:  
In much the same way that hard-core films on videocassette were largely responsible for the rapid introduction of the VCR, porn CD-ROM and on the Internet has hastened the acceptance of these new technologies. Interactive adult CD-ROMs, such as Virtual Valerie and the Penthouse Photo Shoot, create interest in multimedia equipment among male computer buyers. 
According to the article. It goes on to say, and I quote: 
The availability of sexually explicit material through computer bulletin board systems has drawn many users to the Internet. Porn companies have established elaborate web sites to lure customers. 
For instance, `Playboy's web site, which offers free glimpses of its Playmates, now averages about 5 million hits a day.' Five million times someone is logging into the Playboy web site every day. 
The article then goes on to quote a seeming cult figure of the anything goes set in America, Larry Flynt: 
Larry Flynt imagines a future in which the TV and the personal computer have merged. Americans will lie in bed, cruising the Internet with their remote controls and ordering hard-core films at the punch of a button. The Internet promises to combine the video store's diversity of choices with the secrecy of purchases through the mail. 
Why do I bring this up, Mr. President? Because in the last Congress, the 104th Congress, this Senate adopted the Exon-Coats amendment, known as the Communications Decency Act, as part of the telecommunications reform legislation. I bring this up not to point out what Americans should or should not do in the privacy of their bedroom. I bring this up to ask the question as to whether or not we have a responsibility to protect our children from the negative impact of pornography. The Communications Decency Act simply extends the same protections that are currently in place, for children from pornography, that exists in every other means of communication but has not caught up with computer communication. The Internet has exploded on the scene and, yet, the same 
restrictions and protections for children, regarding the distribution of pornography that we have built into telephone technology, television technology, VCR technology, and others, has not been extended to computer technology, until the Communications Decency Act. 
As U.S. News reports, `The Nation's obscenity laws and the Communications Decency Act are the greatest impediments to Flynt's brave new world of porn.' The article said that, `Even he [Larry Flynt] is shocked by some of the material he has obtained through the Internet.' 
Let me quote him. `Some of the stuff on there, I mean, I wouldn't even publish it.' 
Anybody familiar with Mr. Flynt's record in terms of extending the boundaries of publication of pornographic material have to be stunned by this statement. Basically what he is saying is that some of the material that is available on the Internet without any protections for children, is so shocking even he wouldn't publish it in his magazines, which are only sold to adults, or are only supposed to be sold to adults. 
Opponents of the Communications Decency Act, companies like America On-Line, the ACLU, the American Library Association, have argued that there should be no role for government in protecting children, that the Internet can regulate itself. The primary solution that they have offered is a system called PICs, Platform for Internet Content Selection. It is a type of self-rating system. This would allow the publisher of the material, the pornographer, to rate his own home page on the Web, and browsers, the tools that are used to search the Internet, would then respond to these ratings. 
Mr. President, I suggest that it is a ludicrous proposition to allow the pornographer to rate their own material. There is no incentive for compliance.

Mr. President, I thank you for the time.

 Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Senator Lugar and I are introducing today legislation which will more effectively direct Federal funding to those States which have the greatest needs with highway-rail grade crossings. 
We first introduced this bill in the 104th Congress after recognizing a critical deficiency at rail grade crossings which has contributed senseless, tragic deaths over the years. 
This year as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] is reauthorized, it is my hope that the committee will seriously consider the needs of rail-intensive States, such as Indiana. While the final structure of ISTEA is still unknown, I will work to ensure that the objectives of this legislation are incorporated in the final highway bill. 
Rail transportation is important in Indiana, playing a key role in the State's agriculture and manufacturing economy. Much of the rail activity goes through northwest Indiana which accounts for 75 percent of the State's rail crossing accidents. In 1994, Indiana ranked third in the Nation with 263 rail crossing accidents, resulting in the deaths of 27 people. Six percent of all rail crossing accidents in America took place in Indiana and 5.9 percent of the fatalities occurred there. 
Several years ago, I became aware that Indiana and a number of other States had a critical problem with rail accidents. Senator Lugar and I asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to examine the safety conditions in States with a high concentration of rail crossings. The GAO report, completed in August 1995, revealed that while Indiana had a large number of rail crossings--6,700, the sixth largest number of all States--the State received only 3.4 percent of the Federal funding available specifically targeted to prevent such tragedies. 
The Section 130 Program was established in 1973 to help States reduce accidents, injuries, and fatalities at public railroad crossings. In the first 10 years of the program, accidents declined by 61 percent and deaths were reduced by 34 percent. Since 1985, little progress was made toward further reducing these numbers. 
The problem becomes apparent when you realize that many of the States with the highest concentration of crossings, number of accidents, and fatalities receive less money than States that do not have as great a need. Thus, the GAO included that the Federal Government should examine funding formulas and consider using risk factors in determining how to distribute section 130 highway dollars to States for rail safety purposes. 
The current formula funding--based on 10 percent of a State's surface transportation program [STP] funding--does not take into account such essential criteria as a State's total number of crossing, amount of train traffic, nor the number of accidents and fatalities. I believe it is critical that these risk factors be considered in determining how much money a State should receive for rail safety under the current funding structure. 
The formula enhancement bill would correct this flaw in the current formula. Based on the GAO report and work with the Federal Highway Administration, we crafted this legislation to ensure that States with the greatest risk receive more money. This bill does not increase Federal spending. Rather it ensures that money is targeted to those States with the most serious safety concerns. 
Using this more equitable way of disbursing funds, Indiana--which received $4.9 million in fiscal year 1997--could receive $7.3 million in fiscal year 1998. Overall, 21 States would benefit substantially from increased funding to help reduce rail crossing accidents. 
Clearly, this bill addresses one aspect of law, providing a fairer distribution of resources. But money alone will not solve all the problems related to rail crossing accidents. A comprehensive plan to educate people about the dangers at rail crossings must be developed. I support the efforts of programs like Operation Lifesaver which works effectively to get information to citizens. Continued cooperation among all levels of government: local, State, and Federal is essential to stop these sort of tragedies. 
There are many issues facing the Congress this year as we decide funding levels, formulas, and determine the role of the Federal Government in the context of the highway authorization. I supported Senator Warner's legislation last year to provide for a streamlined, flexible, and equitable highway program. I continue to believe this approach is best for the States to address their fundamental needs and priorities. The STEP-21 proposal would ensure that States receive a fairer return on highway funding and the flexibility to spend the resources according to State and local priorities. My purpose in introducing this rail legislation at this time is to draw attention to this serious problem facing Indiana and other States and to show my determination to make rail crossing safety a priority as we make the key decisions on ISTEA. 
We cannot afford to neglect the safety of our citizens at rail grade crossings. We must find ways to address these critical problems. Overall, the safety of our highways and rail is essential as we examine and make decisions on the future of our transportation system. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our focus is indeed comprehensive in addressing our transportation needs.

Mr. COATS. Madam President, I, too, join in sending my congratulations to our new Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, someone with whom I have had the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee now for the past 8 years. 
Bill has been a most articulate and most thoughtful member of that committee--obviously, someone whom we have all come to respect, someone of great intellect and experience, arriving at the House in 1973 and spending a significant part of his lifetime serving the people of Maine and serving the people of this country. 
He is known as a writer. I think he has published eight books, and so it was always interesting to listen to his statements in the Chamber. They were always well-reasoned. They were always well-researched. They were always thoughtful. They were challenging and provocative. Bill had an independent streak which was a great asset. It allowed him to escape the orthodoxy of the political mantra we sometimes find ourselves repeating without a great deal of forethought. Yet Bill's challenge, I think, raised issues that we needed to discuss and needed to consider. While I did not always come to the same conclusion he did, I always respected his thoughtfulness and respect for the conclusions he reached. 
He now assumes a very difficult assignment. These are not easy times at the Department of Defense, not because we find ourselves engaged in any major conflict but because, for a period of more than a decade, we have been undertaking a very significant reorganization following the demise of the cold war and following our success in the gulf. This is not without consequence, and we are now approaching, I believe, our 12th or 13th consecutive year of reductions in defense spending. 
That has taken its toll. It has placed us in a very difficult position. Secretary-designate Cohen this morning in testimony before the Armed Services Committee talked about the world as it is today, the challenges that exist in that world, the threats that we still face, albeit in a different form, and the need to be militarily prepared and to have a strong national security. 
We are undertaking a quadrennial review process which is going to force us, as Secretary Cohen said, to make and face some very difficult choices. The declining budget has not allowed us to maintain the kind of capability that many of us feel is necessary if we are going to pursue a two-regional-response strategy. We face some serious questions regarding modernization, balancing that with the need for readiness and the need for adequate compensation for our personnel and adequate benefits for our personnel, as well as the research and development needed to take us into the next century. 
All of these difficult choices will now fall to our new Secretary of Defense. He is clearly someone with whom both Republicans and Democrats can work. In fact, we have worked together probably in a more bipartisan way on the Armed Services Committee than any other committee in the Senate. And so we stand ready to work with him in attempting to address some of these fundamental questions that are going to determine the course of our defense in future years. 
I asked Bill Cohen this morning what experiences in his life and particularly during his tenure in Congress helped shape his views in terms of the role of the military and the role of defense. He shared with us a response which I had hoped he would give and was pleased that he did give in outlining some of the experiences he has had in traveling to and visiting with and being with our troops as they serve around the world. 
We are often criticized here for some of the travel that we take. I note the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn], is in the Chamber. I will never forget--and it has been a basis of some of the critical decisions I have had to make regarding defense expenditures and defense policy--the trip we took to Kuwait right after the war and watching Senator Glenn interact with marines and naval personnel and military personnel and they react with him. Senator McCain was with us. There is no substitute for leaving the charts and leaving the Vu-Graphs and leaving the cold facts on a piece of paper and getting out in the field and talking to soldiers, whether it is generals or captains or privates or sergeants. 
There is no substitute for learning some of the difficulties that take place, in terms of putting together an adequate defense, some of the challenges that face our country and face those personnel. There is no substitute for dealing with that on a personal basis. Senator Cohen shared that view and shared the view that, when you do that, when you personalize our decisions, when you realize that someone's son or daughter is going to be put at risk in defense of this country, it gives you a different perspective in terms of the kind of equipment, the kind of quality of life, the kind of support for their family, the kind of training and, frankly, the kind of decisions we make in terms of their deployment. I think it is important for every Member to have that perspective. 
I have taken advantage of the opportunity as a member of the Armed Services Committee to travel as much as the schedule will allow and spend as much time with our troops in the field as time allows. It has been just an invaluable experience. I know Senator Cohen will place those experiences at the forefront of his thinking, in terms of the decisions he has to make in the Department of Defense. 
I also congratulate Secretary Perry for just an outstanding tenure as Secretary of Defense. I was one of the people who raised the question early on as to whether Secretary Perry, while I acknowledged his masterful technological skills and management skills, whether he could be an effective Secretary of Defense in a political world, trying to deal with all of us and the give and take that takes place, because he is a mild, soft-spoken man. But he is a man of steel. It does not take shouting and it does not take fist pounding to be effective. Secretary Perry proved that. 
I watched him in negotiations with the Soviets and with the Russians. I watched him in serious policy debates with some of our allies. I watched him interact with us on very important questions relative to defense, in testimony before our committee. He was a model of civility, a model of decency, a great intellect, a thoughtful, articulate spokesman for the Department of Defense. He served this country well and deserves our accolades. 
Finally, let me say when Bill Cohen and I were in the House of Representatives we would participate in the annual Democrat and Republican baseball game. Bill Cohen was known for the best fastball on the team. He struck some fear in the hearts and minds of some of our Democrat opponents. It made me glad I was a Republican. I used to warm up Bill Cohen and that ball was not always down the middle of the plate. I never saw anybody really dig in against him. 
There probably are Members of the House today who owe their health to the fact that every time Bill and I would try to run over from the Senate to play in that game, which Bill was then senior Senator, Senator Mitchell would not adjourn the Senate for us so we could participate. We had to carry our beepers. Inevitably, Senator Mitchell or someone else would call a vote and, before Bill made it to the mound to strike fear in the Democrats, the beeper would go off. I always suspected Senator Mitchell had some kind of communication system with his Democrat colleagues in the House and they would say, `Cohen is warming up in the bullpen, call a vote and get him out of here. Our very lives are at risk.' 
The ability to throw those high hard ones and sometimes keep his adversaries a little bit looser at the plate than maybe they would otherwise be, will serve him well as Secretary of Defense in the tough negotiations that he has coming before him. I wish him nothing but success and I look forward to working with him.

Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the occasion of Ambassador Albright's imminent confirmation as Secretary of State raises some deep concerns regarding this administration's foreign policy. 
While I believe there is much to be admired about Ambassador Albright--she has a reputation as a frank and forthright speaker, who is able to articulate forcibly her views--I have deep reservations about what I believe is her flawed philosophy of the role of U.S. forces in the conduct foreign policy. 
As our U.N. Ambassador over the last 4 years, Mrs. Albright has consistently articulated an alarming vision of post-cold-war foreign policy. It is one which designates the United Nations as the world's guarantor of peace and in so doing seeks to subjugate United States' interests to this world body. 
In June 1993, she articulated the concept of assertive multilateralism as a way of responding to internal political and economic turmoil, defiant regimes, and failed societies in countries around the globe. 
The United States would act primarily as a part of the United Nations to respond to crises throughout the world. 
Fundamental to this premise is the belief that every conflict, every disaster will eventually impact the United States and is therefore in our interests to intervene, militarily, to intervene. 
The United Nations as the instrument of this collective security calls the shots and the United States responds by sending troops. The United States participating with other nations would be able to right the wrongs in the world. This is faulty in concept and dangerous in execution. 
Consider some of the statements she has made: 
Our goal is to foster the development of a community capable of easing, if not terminating, the abominable injustices and conditions that still plague civilization, because only in such a community can America flourish. 
We are also facing increased ethnic and subnational violence. Wherever we turn, someone is fighting or threatening someone else. These disputes may be far removed from our borders but in today's global environment, chaos is an infectious disease. 
The role of the United States is then to `reform or isolate the rogue states that act to undermine the stability and prosperity of 
the larger community and * * * to contain the chaos and ease the suffering in regions of greatest humanitarian concern.' 
There is an obvious and immediate danger to this type of thinking. The reality is there are many problems in the world which we simply cannot resolve. In exerting great effort to accomplish impossible goals we endanger the lives of our troops, damage U.S. leadership and prestige, squander valuable resources, and destroy the will of the American people to intervene when our own interests are indeed threatened. 
The first year of the Clinton administration was dominated by behind the scenes effort to develop a document which would serve as the Clinton policy initiative on multilateral action. The consistent theme of this Presidential Review Directive [PRD-13] was to upgrade the U.N.'s military capabilities and to increase--even institutionalize--the U.S. involvement with U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
Ambassador Albright's comments reveal the lines that PRD-13 would follow. 
We favor substantial enlargement and reorganization of the peacekeeping headquarters staff and the creation of a permanent foundation for rapid 24-hour communication, intelligence, lift, recruitment, training, and the full spectrum of in-theater logistical support. 
Clinton's foreign policy team sought to expand the United Nations to a sort of global police force and equip it to carry out effectively this unrealistic job. The draft document included a rapid expansion of U.N. military capability as well as the idea of putting U.S. forces under U.N. command. This elevated peacekeeping philosophy is illustrated by events in Somalia. 
During President Clinton's first year, he turned over the Bush limited food-delivery mission in Somalia to the United Nations. Over the next few months, United States troops were used to hunt down Somali warlord Aideed and participate in what became known as `nation-building' activities in order to--in Madeleine Albright's words--`promote democracy in that strife-torn nation.' Ultimately 18 U.S. Rangers were killed by Aideed's men. The last American soldiers left Somalia in March 1994--100,000 troops were sent to Somalia; 30 died and 175 were wounded and at a cost of $1.5 billion. Since our departure, fighting erupted and today Somalia is no more better off for our misguided nation-building experience. 
The tragedy of losing United States troops in Somalia forced the administration to back away from some of the aims of PRD-13. PRD-13, when finally signed as PDD-25, had undergone a number of changes. Madeleine Albright now couched the document in terms of fixing U.N. peacekeeping not expanding it. But the 
underlying premise of the policy still had not changed: greater emphasis on the United Nations for resolving conflict. In justifying use of force there was a shift in definition of national security interest. 
In 1993, Ambassador Albright said: 
We have a national security interest in containing and, wherever possible, resolving regional conflicts * * * the cost of runaway regional conflicts sooner or later comes home to America. [June 1993.] 
Her viewpoint--not unique to this administration--fundamentally shifts what previous Presidencies defined as a national security interest and consequently where the President would use American force. This significant alteration of U.S. interests has the profound impact of justifying greater and more diverse missions for our troops. Under the rubric of peace operations, U.S. forces have found themselves in almost every conceivable type mission: delivering food and medicine; building bridges; training police; hunting down warlords. 
Colin Powell's comments in his autobiography further illustrate Madeleine Albright's thinking. He describes a meeting at the White House when she asked him `What's the point of having this superb military you're always talking about if we can't use it?' 
The practical effects of this doctrine have led to our military involvement in Haiti, Bosnia, Central Africa, and other areas only peripherally in our interests. 
What I fear Ambassador Albright has yet to understand is that there are serious costs to using force when our vital interests are not at issue. None of these interventions carried out or contemplated by the Clinton administration were in our security interests. And yet, great numbers of troops have risked their lives and we have spent billions of dollars. 
In Somalia, our forces left, humiliated and at great cost, with the turmoil on the ground basically unchanged. In Haiti, we intervened to restore democracy but prospects for its survival are very much in question, despite our military contribution of $1.2 billion. After 2 years of gradual escalation of United States intervention in Bosnia, the President committed 20,000 of our forces to serve a year to enforce a separation between the warring factions. U.S. troops now extended for 18 months have the task of ensuring that civilian reconstruction proceeds. No one knows what will happen in Bosnia once our troops are removed. 
The military has borne great expense because of these missions. And in an era of declining military budgets, there 
 is a growing anxiety about our capability to deal with future national security threats. Last year military testimony before the Armed Services Committee revealed serious strains in our military planning and budgeting. 
The President's proposed budget for defense was $10 billion lower than what was appropriated the previous year. And yet testimony after testimony by the CINC's and Service Chiefs indicated strong concerns with levels of spending. Readiness, modernization, quality of life were all areas needing focus and funding. The services altogether indicated their desire for more than $15 billion in increases. 
While the administration has failed to provide adequately for our defense needs, it continues to deploy our troops in more and more missions around the world. In recent years our forces have been seriously overextended. We are asking our forces to do more but have drastically cut force structure by 30 percent. General Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff, testified that requirements on the Army have risen 300 percent. Today, more than 41,000 U.S. soldiers are deployed on nearly 1,700 missions in 60 countries. 
And while the President failed to provide adequately for the military--to meet their current and future warfighting needs--he requested a separate budget for contingency operations--a clear indication that the trend toward greater peacekeeping missions will continue. 
I am deeply concerned that the growing use of our forces in areas of peripheral interest will have a long lasting and detrimental impact on our military--and ultimately on the ability of the United States to protect our vital interests. The views of Ambassador Albright confirm her belief in using troops in this way. While the Armed Services Committee can take steps to provide our forces with the funding they need, there is little we can do to reign in how our troops are being used. these essential foreign policy decisions are made by the President, who is both Chief Executive and Commander in Chief. It is my fervent hope that extraordinary caution and wise deliberation will be exercised during the next 4 years in determining how to use American forces to further the foreign policy goals of this administration.
