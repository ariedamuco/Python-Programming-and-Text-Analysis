 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to Air Force Lieutenant General Dave J. McCloud who died in a tragic plane crash on July 26, 1998 in Alaska. Dave McCloud was an outstanding officer, husband and father. The nation and the Air Force lost one of its finest military leaders when Dave McCloud passed away. General McCloud was an energetic, sincere and honest man who I considered a true friend. Like many others, I mourn Dave's passing every day. 
I know Dave's wife Anna misses her partner and I know his son and daughter, Robyn, miss their father. I offer my deepest condolences to all of Dave's family and friends. 
As a final tribute to fighter pilot Dave McCloud, I offer the following poem, `High Flight,' which epitomizes my friend in so many ways. 
High Flight  
Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth 
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; 
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth 
Of sun-split clouds--and done a hundred things 
You have not dreamed of--wheeled and soared and swung 
High in the sunlit silence, Hov'ring there, 
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung 
My eager craft through footless halls of air. 
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue 
I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace 
Where never lark, or even eagle flew 
And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod 
The high untrespassed sanctity of space, 
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God. 
By Pilot Officer John Gillispie Magee, Jr. No 412 Squadron, RCAF (1922-1941) 
`High Flight', a poem by John Gillespie Magee, Jr. An American/British fighter pilot. He flew with the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II. He came to Britain, flew in a Spitfire squadron, and was killed at age 19 on December 11, 1941, during a training flight from the airfield near Scopwick, Lincolnshire. The poem was written on the back of a letter to his parents which stated, `I am enclosing a verse I wrote the other day. It started at 30,000 feet, and was finished soon after I landed.'

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine Marine Corps Officer, Lieutenant General Carol Mutter, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. 
General Mutter, a native daughter of Colorado, will soon retire from active duty following a long and distinguished career as an officer of Marines. A graduate of the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, CO she joined the Marine Corps in 1966 and completed the Woman Officer Basic Course in 1967. She was then trained as a data processing officer and assigned to data processing installations in Quantico, VA and Camp Pendleton, CA. In 1971, she returned to Quantico as a platoon commander and instructor for women officer candidates and basic course lieutenants. 
Over the years, Carol has made significant accomplishments both as a Marine officer and as a woman. As a Colonel, in July 1988 she joined the U.S. Space Command, J-3 (Operations) Directorate in Colorado Springs where she became the first woman to gain qualification as a Space Director. After initially serving as a Command Center Crew Commander/Space Director she became the Division Chief responsible for the operation of the Commander in Chief s Command Center. In June 1992, she transferred to Okinawa for a second tour, this time as the first woman of general/flag officer rank to command a major deployable tactical command, the 3d Force Service Support Group, Third Marine Expeditionary Force, U.S. Marine Forces Pacific. Finally, upon advancement to Lieutenant General (the first woman in the Marine Corps to attain this rank) on September 1, 1996, she assumed her current duties. 
Throughout her services as a Marine, she worked continually to improve herself through furthering her professional military education and earning a M.A. degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College at Newport, RI and honorary doctorate degrees from Salve Regina College, also in Newport, RI and another honorary doctorate from UNC. In addition to the Naval War College at Newport, RI, General Mutter also attended the Amphibious Warfare School and the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, both at Quantico, VA 
We know the officers and men and women of the Marine Corps, from the Commandant on down, will sorely miss the service of Lieutenant General Mutter as she departs the Marine Corps. Among her many awards and recognitions are the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Navy Achievement Medal--worthy recognition for days, months and years of selfless dedication. The Marine Corps loss will be Indiana's gain as she settles in her new home in the Indianapolis area. We offer the warmest wishes to Carol and her husband Jim as they embark upon their new endeavors. 
God Bless and good luck to a truly wonderful woman. Lieutenant General Mutter is truly a great American patriot and an inspiration to all.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate you presiding as you do in such a class fashion. I would like to make a few comments here. I have been touched and impressed by the fact of colleagues coming to the floor and paying tribute to those Members who are departing. I have listened because, as one of those Members who are departing, I know personally how much it means to hear those kind comments that are made. 
Senator Ford, who just spoke, is leaving after a very illustrious career. I remember when the Republican Party took over the majority 4 years ago and I was new to the position of Presiding Officer, it was not unusual for Wendell Ford, who knows many of the ropes around here, to come and pull me aside and give me a few of the tips of how I could be effective as a Presiding Officer. I think probably one of the highest tributes you can pay to an individual is the fact that you see their family and the success they have had. I remember when Wendell Ford's grandson, Clay, was a page here. I think Clay is probably one of the greatest tributes paid to a grandfather. 
Dale Bumpers, often mentioned here on the floor about his great sense of humor, is an outstanding gentlemen. He is someone whom I remember before I ever became involved in politics. I watched him as a Governor of Arkansas and thought, there is a man who has great integrity, someone you can look up to. And then to have the opportunity to serve with him has been a great honor. 
John Glenn. Whenever any of the astronauts--the original seven--would blast off into space, my mother would get all the boys up so we could watch them. I remember when John Glenn blasted off into space. Again, the idea that somehow a kid would end up here and would serve with John Glenn is just something I never could dream of at the time. In fact, John Glenn became a partner in our efforts to stop unfunded Federal mandates. You could not ask for a better partner. 
Speaking of partners, he could not have a better partner than Annie. I had the great joy of traveling with them approximately a year ago when we went to Asia. That is when you get to know these people as couples. I remember that we happened to be flying over an ocean when it was the Marine Corps' birthday. On the airplane we had a cake and brought it out, to the surprise of John Glenn. But you could see the emotion in his eyes. I know the Presiding Officer is a former U.S. Marine, so he knows what we are talking about. 
Dan Coats. There is no more genuine a person than Dan--not only in the Senate but on the face of the Earth. He is a man of great sincerity, a man who can articulate his position so extremely well. He is a man who, when you look into his eyes, you know he is listening to you and he is going to do right by you and by the people of his State of Indiana, and he has done right by the people of the United States. He is a man who has great faith, a man to whom I think a number of us have looked for guidance. 
When you look at the Senate through the eyes of a camera, you see just one dimension. But on the floor of the Senate we are just people. A lot of times we don't get home to our wives and kids and sometimes to the ball games or back-to-school nights. There are times when some of the issues don't go as we would like, and it gets tough. At these times, we hurt. There are people like Dan Coats to whom you can turn, who has said, `Buddy, I have been there and I am with you now.' So, again, he is an outstanding individual. 
Also, Mr. President, I have been really fortunate with the quality of the staff I have had here in the U.S. Senate during the 6 years I have been here. As I have listened so many times to the Senate clerk call the roll of those Senators, they have answered that roll. I would like to just acknowledge this roll of those staff members whom I have had. This is probably the first and only time their names will be called in this august Chamber: 
Cindy Agidius, Marcia Bain, Jeremy Chou, Camy Mills Cox, Laurette Davies, Michelle Dunn, Becky English, Gretchen Estess, Ryan Fitzgerald, Lance Giles. 
Charles Grant, Ernie Guerra, Julie Harwood, Laura Hyneman, Meg Hunt, Catherine Josling, Ann Klee, Amy Manwaring, John McGee, Liz Mitchell. 
Heather Muchow, Jay Parkinson, Phil Reberger, Rachel Riggs, Shawna Seiber Ward, Orrie Sinclair, Mark Snider, Glen Tait, Jim Tate, Kelly Teske. 
Salle Uberuaga, Jennifer Wallace, Brian Whitlock, Suzanne Bacon, Becky Bale, Stan Clark, Tom Dayley, Tyler Dougherty, Carolyn Durant, George Enneking. 
Buzz Fawcett, Margo Gaetz, Erin Givens, Jim Grant, Wendy Guisto, Jennifer Hayes, Al Henderson, Heather Irby, Steve Judy, Jeff Loveng. 
Brian McCormack, Darrell McRoberts, Peter Moloney, Scott Muchow, Dan Ramirez, Dixie Richardson, Stephanie Schisler, Carrie Stach, Gary Smith, Michael Stinson, Sally Taniguchi, Julie Tensen, Mitchell Toryanski, Brian Waidmann, Vaughn Ward. 
That is a lot of staff. But over 6 years, some of those have come and gone.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this will probably be the last time officially on this floor as a U.S. Senator that I look at the faces of these people that you and I have worked with--the clerks, and Parliamentarians, the staff. It is family. The young pages that we see here with that sparkle in their eye and the enthusiasm that they have for this process--it is fun to talk to you and to see your sense of enthusiasm for this. As I said, you are going to have a sense of the U.S. Senate like few citizens, because you have been here, you have experienced it, and you have been up close in person. 
But to those of you that I see now as I look to the desk, those who have sat in your places that I have worked with through these years, I thank you. America is well served by you, by your professionalism and your dedication. 
So I thank you. I thank the Cloakroom again; all of the family; the staff, from the police officers and the waiters and waitresses, and the folks who make this place work; the Senate Chaplain; and, Mr. President, again I thank you for your courtesy, and I bid you farewell. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, over the last 33 years, Lt Gen Michael D. McGinty has served as an exemplary Air Force officer. His career-long efforts to provide quality support to all the members of the Air Force and their families serve as a benchmark for other military services and leave a lasting and positive legacy of Air Force personnel policy and practice. 
Lt Gen Mike McGinty entered the Air Force as a distinguished graduate of the University of Minnesota Reserve Officer Training Corps program. In his early days as an Air Force pilot, Lt Gen McGinty flew the F-4 and logged over 115 combat missions in Southeast Asia, including 100 missions over North Vietnam. 
As his Air Force career progressed, Lt Gen McGinty gained vast experience both as an pilot and as a personnel expert. He earned the rating of Command Pilot with more than 3,500 flight hours in a variety of aircraft, including the F-4, A-10, C-21 and T-39. He also invested 19 years of his career working a broad range of Air Force personnel issues. 
In March 1988, Mike McGinty assumed command of the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at the Royal Air Force Station in Alconbury, England. During a time of great change in world affairs, Lt Gen McGinty worked diligently to maintain and solidify local host nation relations while simultaneously enhancing quality of life support for service members assigned to his command. As a result of Lt Gen McGinty's vision and dedication to his troops he established Alconbury's first-ever Family Support Center. 
As commander of the Air Force Military Personnel Center, and more recently as the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Lt Gen McGinty led the Air Force through a period of great challenge and change. During his tenure, Mike moved Air Force personnel systems into the `electronic era.' He expertly managed significant drawdowns of both military and civilian personnel while simultaneously meeting the expanded personnel requirements resulting from increased deployments. A constant advocate for Air Force people, he led the way in working difficult issues in the rated force management, recruiting, retention, and transition assistance arenas. Lt Gen McGinty worked to meet changing Air Force needs by expanding the role of Department of the Air Force civilians in Air Force personnel management. He increased career broadening opportunities for Air Force civilians through developmental positions at the Air Staff, the Air Force Personnel Center, and major command headquarters. He established the first-ever Air Force Civilian Executive Matters Office, introducing policies and operations that ensure training and development of senior civilians that parallels their military counterparts. His efforts in this arena clearly enhance force stability. 
Most importantly, Lt Gen McGinty's career has been based on his unfaltering support of Air Force people. His philosophy has been that `the strength of the Air Force lies in it's members.' He remains a strong advocate for ongoing quality of life initiatives, enhanced family support services, career mentoring, and leadership by example. 
I have personally known Mike McGinty for several years as both a colleague and a friend. We have worked together to improve our nation's Air Force by addressing the critical people issues we face: retaining our key qualified and experienced Air Force professionals, improving the quality of life for our families, enhancing our recruiting efforts, and placing our pay and benefits programs where they should be to take care of those who guard and defend our nation. Mike has led the way in this effort, a performance characteristic of his entire career. The men and women of the Air Force, as well as our entire nation, owe him a debt of gratitude. I recall his candor and wisdom during testimony as a shining example of how well our military leaders represent the best interests of our men and women in uniform. 
Also a dedicated family man, Mike and his wife, Karen, are the proud parents of a daughter, Shannon, and a son, Tim. In addition to flying, their interests include bird watching and photography. 
During his distinguished career, the general has earned some of our nation's highest honors: the Distinguished Service Medal twice, the Legion of Merit twice, the Distinguished Flying Cross with device, the Meritorious Service Medal four times, and the Air Medal ten times, along with the Air Force Commendation Medal and numerous campaign and service medals. 
Lt Gen Mike McGinty's vision, leadership and dedication will have a lasting positive impact on the Air Force and the nation. As he embarks upon his retirement, I wish him continued success in all that he and Karen pursue. Those of us in Congress, and the men and women of our Air Force, will greatly miss him.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to delcare my support for the fiscal year 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill. 
American agriculture is in a state of emergency. No one who has read a commodity report in the last few months would disagree. Wheat and barley prices are at record lows as are prices for other important Idaho agricultural products. In August, I talked to growers all over Idaho who are on the verge of bankruptcy, they tell me they are in trouble. 
This appropriations bill will help farmers get back on their feet. The bill provides funding for a wide range of USDA programs, including agricultural research, export initiatives, foreign market development, nutrition programs and other department operations. Much-needed short term relief is also provided--$1.5 billion in one-time payments to assist producers who have been hit by crop losses in 1998, an additional $675 million to provide assistance to farmers who have suffered multi-year crop losses, $175 million for livestock feed assistance in a cost-share program available to ranchers who lost their 1998 feed supplies to disaster, and $1.65 billion for increased AMTA (Agriculture Market Transition Act) payments. 
In a time when its farmers are experiencing severe economic hardship, Idaho is one of the big winners in the process. Many important Idaho research projects were included in the bill, including over $1.2 million for potato variety development, $329,000 for peas and lentils, $423,000 for grass seed and $550,000 for small fruit research, among others. 
The agriculture appropriations bill will also help promote American agriculture overseas. The Market Access Program continues to be a vital and important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and expanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm income and protecting American jobs. MAP has been a tremendous success by any measure. Since the program was established, U.S. agricultural exports have doubled. In fiscal year 1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 billion and contributing billions of dollars more in increased economic activity and additional tax revenues. This appropriations bill continues funding for MAP. 
Also included in the bill is funding for the Agriculture Education Competitive Grants Program. This program funds grants for school-based agricultural education at the high school and junior college levels of instruction. Competitive grants targeted to school-based agricultural education will be used to enhance curricula, increase teacher competencies, promote the incorporation of agriscience and agribusiness education into other subject matter, like science and mathematics, and facilitate joint initiatives between secondary schools, 2-year postsecondary schools, and 4-year universities. This will help our young people be successful in an ever-increasing competitive agriculture market. 
Is this is a perfect bill? No, but it is one that is fiscally responsible and it does not return to the failed policies of the past. We must allow American farmers to compete and give them the tools they need to do so. This bill is another step in that direction. 
Mr. President, I will vote yes for the appropriations bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the managers as to the intent of the conferees with respect to the issuance of grazing permits for lands withdrawn and reserved under Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 in the event that the Air Force relinquishes such withdrawn lands. As the managers know, the Juniper Butte Range withdrawal under title XXIX, would withdraw certain public lands for use by the Air Force as a training area. The lands are withdrawn from the existing Juniper draw allotment managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in an area south of the Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The withdrawal is from the center of the allotment, leaving approximately 6,000 perimeter acres of the allotment still under a grazing permit and the jurisdiction of the BLM. It is my understanding that, at such time as the Air Force relinquishes its use of the withdrawn lands and returns jurisdiction to the Department of the Interior, the holder of the grazing permit for the Juniper draw allotment at that time should have an opportunity to obtain a grazing permit for the relinquished lands in the center of the allotment.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers of this important legislation for their response to our inquiry. Mr. President, I wish to determine whether the managers of the legislation agree with my understanding as to one additional provision. Section 2917(b)(3) of the Juniper Butte Range Withdrawal Act provides for delegated authority and approvals granted by the Bureau of Land Management pursuant to the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior, or the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management. Section 2907(b)(1) specifically refers to the authority of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management to grant rights-of-way and approvals must be granted by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management. This is as it should be. Mr. President, I ask the managers of this legislation if my characterization is accurate?

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act [NAWCA] has been very successful in its stated goal of providing for long-term conservation of dozens of species of migratory birds and their habitats through the coordinated action of governments, private organizations, and landowners. 
In Idaho, a typical NAWCA project benefits mallards, pintails, cinnamon teal, gadwall, long-billed curlews, peregrine falcons, bald eagles, sandhill cranes, river otter, elk, pronghorn, mule deer, and many species of native fish. But one species in particular benefits in Idaho from NAWCA. The Trumpeter Swan has made a real comeback because of conservation under NAWCA. 
Trumpeter Swans were once widespread and abundant across North America. But by 1900 they were reduced to near extinction by subsistence and commercial hunting. In fact, outside of Alaska, only one small remnant of fewer than 200 survived in remote sites in Eastern Idaho and nearby habitats in the Rocky Mountains. Most wintered in the high elevation wilderness west of Yellowstone National Park. 
Although never officially listed as threatened or endangered, many agencies and private individuals have worked for decades to restore this population, which today numbers about 2,500 and nests from south eastern Idaho north to the Canadian Northwest Territories. 
Restoration of this beautiful bird has required habitat protection and improvement, law enforcement to prevent illegal shooting, and years of research and management on Trumpeter Swans to restore a secure distribution. In eastern Idaho, this effort has involved conservation groups, including the Trumpeter Swan Society; irrigators, Indian tribes, private landowners, and businesses all working with the Federal Agencies, Idaho state parks and Idaho Fish and Game Department in cooperative efforts to ensure that the swans thrive. 
The wintering population in the vicinity of the Harriman State Park and the famous Henry's Fork has risen to about 1,000 birds. These are northern birds that come south to winter in Eastern Idaho with our own resident birds. There is a real need to further distribute these swans further south in the winter to reduce crowding, protect the habitats, and to scatter the population better. 
Juvenile Swans do not learn ancestral migratory routes to more southern wintering areas in the absence of adults that can lead them to new areas. While we are steadily improving the habitat in the more southern parts of the State at sites like Bear Lake NWR, we will have to reestablish the migratory instinct. 
From the Teton River Basin Wetlands and the Thousand Springs/Chilly Slough Projects [1-4], to the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge the NAWCA has helped the Trumpeter Swan in Idaho, and provided places to nest and distribute the winter population. These six projects have brought a $5.5 million investment to Idaho that will help the swans and dozens of other species. 
Non-profit organizations provide important assistance to NAWCA efforts. Ducks Unlimited [DU], in particular, has contributed more money and effort to NAWCA than any other non-government entity. In the last few years they have contributed over $81 million. Bear Lake NWR alone has received over $1 million from DU and NAWCA. 
The future looks bright for Rocky Mountain trumpeters if we can manage their habitats and provide secure wintering areas. A century ago, we almost lost Trumpeter Swans. The 21st century looks much brighter as a result of proactive, cooperative efforts to protect the swans and their habitat. As Trumpeters return to the wetlands that we conserve through programs like the North American Wetland Conservation Fund, they are an inspiring reminder of the progress that is possible.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Natural Resources Institute legislation. Congressman Crapo, who represents the second Congressional district in my state of Idaho, introduced the Natural Resources Institute legislation in the House, on September 17, 1998. I believe this legislation will help find solutions to many of the problems that affect the health of our environment. 
This country is faced with the challenge of protecting the environment, while maintaining economic growth. The use of our nation's natural resources touches all of our lives every day. However, this use has left a legacy of fragmented land-use and regions of environmental degradation, including areas in my home state of Idaho. 
Unfortunately, there has not been a comprehensive and coordinated effort to address these environmental issues or an organized effort to help other communities from making similar mistakes. I believe that many of these problems could be avoided if the communities faced with land-use decisions had access to sound scientific research. 
The Natural Resources Institute Act, utilizing expertise from national laboratories and universities, will provide communities with access to sound scientific research when making environmental and land-use decisions. In addition, the Natural Resources Institute Act will coordinate research efforts to solve real-world environmental problems. It will be particularly helpful in addressing problems associated with agriculture, logging, grazing, hydro-power, fishing, mining, recreation and other natural resource activities. 
Mr. President, I believe this important legislation gives state and local governments the necessary tools to make sound informed decisions regarding land-use decisions. I would like to commend Congressman Crapo for his leadership on this important issue.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you, very much. May I also thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his patience. He has an amendment to offer. 
I rise to thank the chairman, the Senator from Kentucky, and the ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, for his help on two amendments which I placed in this foreign ops bill, and also some very important language that they worked out with me with regard to the IMF. 
By way of explanation, 
the amendments require U.S. directors of international institutions (such as the IMF and Agency for International Development, AID) to use the voice and vote of the United States to encourage purchase of American products, commodities and equipment. This legislation requires that our directors of international organizations use their influence to encourage purchase of U.S. ag commodities. 
The amendments also require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress annually on the efforts of the heads of federal agencies and the U.S. executive directors of international financial institutions to promote the purchase of American commodities. We can't just tell these directors to promote our products, we must also have some accountability, so we can encourage and see the results of U.S. agricultural commodities actually being purchased. 
This is strong, unambiguous language. The concept and language of this amendment affecting surplus commodities should be applied to the equally important issue that funds made available through this bill should purchase American agricultural products. 
If we are going to ask American farmers and ranchers to pay their taxes to support the financial assistance provided in this bill, then we should ask their American representatives in these international financial institutions to urge the purchase of American agriculture commodities with the funds made available with this bill. 
The foreign operations bill also attempts to increase exports of American products and also seeks to make sure that the International Monetary Fund will not subsidize the foreign semiconductor industry to the detriment of American semiconductor companies. Specifically, the provisions require the Secretary of Treasury to certify to Congress that no IMF resources will support semiconductor and other key industries in any form, and that the Secretary of the Treasury will instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to use the voice and vote of the United States to oppose disbursement of further funds if such certification is not given. 
Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member again for working with me on this particular language which is critically important to the semiconductor industry. Senator Craig and I have met with a number of individuals from the U.S. Treasury, including the Secretary of Treasury, Robert Rubin, prior to his trip to Asia. I believe that he delivered a very strong message to the countries in Asia. 
As we have talked about the semiconductor business, the transparency issue of the International Monetary Fund, as well as agriculture, they are all linked together because when we met with a number of the national ag commodity groups, they all said there is a crisis that exists in agriculture today, and one of the elements that they stressed that was important was to see the recovery of economies around the world, certainly in Asia so that those markets, again, are available to U.S. agricultural commodities. 
So, again, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his great help and leadership on this issue.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my praise for the men and women of the Idaho National Guard as they prepare to complete their exercise at our nation's crown jewel for desert warfare training. 
It is, Mr. President, the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California. It is in those harsh and challenging conditions that our Army and National Guard personnel receive the best training of any armed force in the world. 
I had the pleasure of spending this past weekend with the 116th Cavalry Brigade of the Idaho Army National Guard as they conducted Operation Desert Avenger at the NTC. The 116th, also called the Snake River Brigade, is only the second National Guard brigade to train at NTC in eight years. And from what I saw, Mr. President, they are more than holding their own. 
Under the leadership of The Adjutant General, Major General Jack Kane, Brigade Commander Colonel Lawrence LaFrenz, Sergeant Major Austin Cummins and Brigade Sergeant Major Patrick Murphy, the men and women of the 116th have set an example that all future National Guard units will be hard-pressed to match. 
Mr. President, the Snake River Brigade spent over two years preparing for their training rotation at NTC. Not only was there the logistical problems associated with getting more than 1,700 Idahoans and their equipment to California, but they supplemented the Idaho Guard with units from 41 other states and Canada. Nearly 5,000 men and women of the National Guard are taking part in Operation Desert Avenger. One can only imagine the myriad of details that had to be handled to make this exercise a success. Think of all the planning that had to be done years ahead of the actual training. Mr. President, under the guidance of the Adjutant General and his staff, I believe Idaho's 116th Brigade has developed the model for how Guard units should prepare for this high intensity training. 
Not only was the Snake River Brigade prepared, they performed above expectations. While these training exercises are not a test, the performance is observed and evaluated. The goal is to make the leadership and troops perform to the best of their ability. On the day I visited, the 116th beat the opposition forces. That is significant. Active duty Army units that come to NTC on a regular basis that don't do that. Those Idahoans can now go home with their heads held high. Talking with the tank crews, artillery units and support teams later, you can see the devotion they have and how high morale is. I'll tell you, Mr. President, had there been a National Guard recruiter on the field right after that battle, many of those soldiers would have immediately signed up for another tour of duty. 
All Idahoans can be proud of the citizen-soldiers of the Snake River Brigade, and I would like to salute them here in the United States Senate. 
These men and women are on call, prepared to defend our freedom. Mr. President, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the families of these patriots, who support them at home, and to the employers, who allow them the time away from work to attend training like NTC.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a national resource that is training the military leaders of today and tomorrow. It is the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. 
The commanding officer of the National Training Center, Brigadier General Dean Cash, is a soldier's soldier. He is dedicated to developing leaders, and he leads by example. General Cash is also dedicated to the soldiers' families. Despite the long hours and tough duty, General Cash makes sure none of the soldiers or officers in his command misses the birth of their child or a birthday celebration. He believes those are significant events that cannot be missed. 
And General Cash wants to make sure the families are cared for. Whether its child care, shopping or support groups, the families of the soldiers assigned to Fort Irwin get the best available. The base takes an active role in the schools and also has extended its reach to at-risk children in the Los Angeles basin. 
The soldiers at Fort Irwin and the National Training Center are professionals. They present the greatest challenge for units training at the center. This is their mission, and they do it well. 
I believe, Mr. President, that the reason our forces were successful against Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm was the training they received at NTC. They were in an environment very similar to conditions in the Middle East. They were fighting against forces simulating the style of the former Soviet bloc. And they were fighting against tanks, artillery and infantry units with a `home field' advantage. The permanent opposition force at NTC knows every rock, every hill and every ravine. That is a tremendous advantage, and really tests the leadership skills of the training forces. 
As we see the downsizing of our active Army force, we must have a National Guard and Reserve component acting as an integral part of our military if we have a significant crisis anywhere in the world that we have to deal with. That is why, Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Idaho Snake River Brigade is able to train at NTC. We need to make sure they're ready if called upon. 
The facilities at NTC are, to say the least, very impressive. Using the latest state-of-the-art computer, laser and satellite technology, the instructors and observers at NTC can tell, in real time, where every tank, every piece of artillery and every humvee is at any moment. And each soldier's movements, radio communications and weapons are continuously monitored. 
When a simulated battle is complete, the instructors go through each exercise with the individual unit commanders. They find out what went right, what went wrong, and what can be done to improve. This attention to detail is vital. The only way our nation is going to maintain the best military in the world is to have the best leaders leading the best-trained forces. They're getting that education at the National Training Center. 
Countless individuals provide that education. I met two who I'd like to highlight. Colonel J.D. Thurman is Chief of the Operations Group, and Colonel John Rosenberger is Commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Both men are soldiers. But both are educators. They take their jobs very seriously, and they see the value to what they're doing. It's because of their dedication and skill that our Army turns out commanders for the next century--commanders who will be on the front lines of defending democracy. 
I would like to encourage my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and others in the Senate to visit the National Training Center and see it first hand. You can't leave there without being totally impressed with the dedication of the officers and the enlisted personnel at Fort Irwin and their belief in what they're doing. To see how it enhances the morale and training of units that rotate through NTC, is impressive. This is a national resource that deserves our utmost support.

<TEXT>
Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this morning we will vote on an amendment that brings to light a particularly glaring injustice of the Federal Tax Code, and that is the marriage tax penalty. 
In recent months, the Senate has debated this issue more than once. I think these efforts are significant. I congratulate Senators Brownback and Ashcroft for offering this amendment and also the many other Members who have championed the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. 
Let me also say this: The U.S. Senate should not rest until we are able to eliminate this counterproductive, unfair, and regressive policy. I will continue to support amendments to end the marriage tax penalty until we are successful. 
I ask myself one fundamental question before I make up my mind on any issue we deal with on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is: Does this policy make sense for the American people? 
Let us apply this question to our current Federal Tax Code, which quite simply penalizes a working couple for getting married. Should folks pay more tax because they are married? Absolutely not. 
The marriage tax penalty raises revenue for the Government but it is poor public policy. It most often raises taxes on lower- and middle-income families who claim the standard deduction. That is wrong. We must strengthen the bonds of family to strengthen the fabric of our society. 
Before 1969, marriages were treated by the Federal Tax Code like partnerships--allowing husbands and wives to split their incomes evenly. In 1969, the practice of income splitting was ended. By doing this, the Government did nothing less than penalize American couples for marrying. 
Since that time, with the Nation's progressive tax rates, tax laws have meant that working married couples are forced to pay significantly more money in taxes than they would if they were both single. Currently, 42 percent of married couples suffer because of the marriage tax penalty. 
Let me provide an example. A single person earning $24,000 per year is taxed at a rate of 15 percent. If two people, each earning $24,000, get married, the IRS, by taxing them on their combined income, taxes them in the 28-percent bracket. 
This amendment will phase out the marriage tax penalty by allowing married couples to file a combined return. By doing this, each spouse is taxed using the rates applicable to unmarried individuals so that one spouse's lesser income does not push a couple's combined income into a higher tax bracket. 
Some might argue that it is the job of the Federal Government to promote good behavior; others might disagree. But I think that we could all agree on one issue: The Federal Government should not be penalizing marriages, a sacrosanct institution and the bedrock of our social structure. It is time for the Federal Government to end this injustice to the American family. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
How many times have we heard, Mr. President, statements by Senators on the floor of this institution talking about family values--family, the fabric of this society? Yet, here we have tax policy that penalizes families. It is time to end the injustice. Again, I support Senator Brownback and Senator Ashcroft and the leadership on this issue. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, for the past 5 years I have had the honor of sponsoring the resolution designating National Peace Officers Memorial Day. This year we added the names of 159 officers to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Since the inception of this memorial, 14,662 peace officers have been added to the wall. 
Next year, two more names will now be added to the wall. These memorials and others around the Nation serve as proof that the individuals who serve this Nation, as our guardians of peace, do so at great personal risk. There are few communities in America that have not been touched by the senseless death of a peace officer by violent means. 
This community of Capitol Hill has been touched by tragedy. On Friday, two of our own, Officers John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut, were felled by an assailant while they performed their duties. 
America should know that for all the influence of this city and this place, this is, in some ways, like a small town. We know the people in this community as well as we know the people in our own communities back home. The employees who work here day to day become very familiar faces to those of us who are sent here temporarily by our States. 
The Capitol Hill Police have a very special duty and a very special trust. They guard this place, this summit of freedom, this people's house, and keep it safe for the citizens of the world. The Capitol Hill Police perform this duty with an unwavering commitment to our safety. And they are willing, as Officers Gibson and Chestnut proved, to lay down their lives for all of our safety. 
John Gibson, who I knew personally--a tremendous professional in every sense of the word. When I saw his photograph in the paper, the difference was every time that I would see John or have a word with him his face always had a smile. 
J.J. Chestnut, who worked in one of the entrances to this great building, like so many of our officers, was perceived to be more than just a police officer to the wonderful citizens who come to this magnificent building. I think they sense that instead of just a police officer, they are being greeted by ambassadors in the people's house. 
I believe that our Capitol Police Department exemplify the finest in America. I have never heard any statement that any of our police officers have been badge-heavy. I have simply heard great reviews of the professionals who carry the badge of the Capitol Police Department. 
I know many of the Capitol Police officers personally. I have listened to stories about their families. I have seen photographs of their kids--just parent talking to parent who share a funny story or observation or simply a good word at the end of the day. But in the end, put most simply, they are here to take care of us. 
As we near the end of this century, we are often impelled to observe this country is cynical. It is, I suppose, in the American character to question our condition and bemoan the things that are not now as we remember them to be. But in truth, the sacrifice of these men and their families are akin to the selfless ideal that has made this country great. The bravery and the commitment to community that these men possessed will be carried on by their families. 
I have had the honor to meet with the families of slain officers from my home State. The strength and the perseverance that is exemplified by each of them is an inspiration to me. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to these families and others who have been devastated by this type of senseless violence. There is no answer to the meaningless violence that occurs, but we must celebrate and memorialize the lives of the officers who serve and protect us. 
To the Capitol Hill Police, I would like to simply say, I am sorry for your loss and for our loss because we are family here, 
to say how proud all of us are of you and to thank you for your service that you give to us each and every day, and to say to the families of Officer Gibson, Officer Chestnut: Your husband, your father, demonstrated service beyond self in the most dramatic way--by sacrificing their lives for our safety, for our freedom. 
Our prayers are with John, with Officer Chestnut, with their families, and with the other officers who continue that tradition of being truly some of the finest anywhere in the Nation or the world. You are our friends, you are our guardians, so that we can do our duty here in the Nation's Capitol. God bless these two officers and God bless what they mean to all of us. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lieutenant General Frederick E. Vollrath upon his retirement from the United States Army. General Vollrath has served our great nation with honor and distinction for 35 years and his performance throughout his career has been characterized by the highest standards of professional ethics and commitment to soldiers. 
General Vollrath's outstanding career began when he was commissioned a second lieutenant upon completion of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and graduation from the University of Miami in 1963. During his military career, he completed the Adjutant General Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, the United States Army Command and General Staff College, the United States Army War College, the National Security Management. 
His initial assignments include Adjutant General and Deputy Chief of Staff, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Carson, Colorado; Director of Personnel Service Support, Director of Enlisted Personnel Management, and Chief, Enlisted Assignment Division, 1st Personnel Command, U.S. Army Europe. He has also held a variety of important command and staff positions to include Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army; Director of Military Personnel Management, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Department of the Army; Director of Enlisted Personnel U.S. Total Army Personnel Command, Alexandria, Virginia; Commander, Personnel Information Systems Command; Chief of Staff and later Deputy Commander, 1st Personnel Command, U.S. Army Europe; Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters, Department of the Army and culminating his career with his most recent duty as Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters, Department of the Army. 
General Vollrath's military awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal. 
General Vollrath has truly made a difference to our Army and our Nation. He has always fought for what was right for the Army, it's soldiers, civilians and family members. He has established a solid reputation among his peers and superiors as the single driving force in ensuring the personnel community has stayed on the leading edge of sustaining the personnel readiness for the Total Army. 
I would ask my colleagues to join me in wishing General Vollrath and his wife, Joy, all the best and thank them for 35 years of dedicated and unselfish service to our Nation. We wish them both a very fulfilling retirement.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from New Hampshire, the Subcommittee chairman of Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary and the Senator from South Carolina, the Ranking Member of that Subcommittee in a colloquy. 
As chairman of the Drinking Water Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am concerned that the National Marine Fisheries Service's guidelines on essential fish habitat have exceeded the scope of congressional intent. In 1996, Congress amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The National Marine Fisheries Service's interpretation of a provision in that Act concerns me, the States and a diverse range of affected businesses and citizens throughout the country.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As my distinguished colleague points out, the original provision was limited, focusing on increased efficiency and, wherever appropriate, information coordination. Congress did not intend to authorize a provision that created a sweeping new regulatory program. 
Concerns have been raised about the complexity of the NMFS `essential fish habitat' regulations not add a new level of regulation in addition to what is required under the endangered Species Act.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As envisioned by NMFS, essential fish habitat covers much of the coastal, marine, and estuarine waters of the United States, and it includes some inland habitat for anadromous species. The broad definition of `essential fish habitat' raised concerns that NMFS will apply the EFH virtually everywhere. 
In addition, serious concerns have been raised by nonfishing interests regarding their lack of participation in the development of these guidelines. Nonfishing interests were not heavily involved in the development of the guidelines. But when NMFS issued the proposal, a coalition of groups felt that their participation should have been solicited.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I agree. They object to the scope of the proposed EFH program and are concerned that it will subject activities, including land development, agriculture, water supply, forestry, and mining, to the jurisdiction of the Fishery Management Councils under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Ideally, these guidelines, along with the comments submitted by nonfishing interests, will be thoroughly reviewed and, if necessary, republished by the NMFS. Congress should carefully watch this situation.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Idaho's Very High Performance Backbone Network system (vBNS). 
The State of Idaho is in a strategic position to increase its economic base by strengthening collaboration on research and development projects between the state's universities, state government and business and industry. The U of I was approved, pursuant to a July 31, 1997, submission, for connection to the National Science Foundation's very high performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS). The proposed statewide network would connect the University of Idaho with Idaho State University, Boise State University, state government and industrial partners such as Micron and Hewlett-Packard. For appropriate research purposes, this Intranet could connect through the UI to the vBNS. The Intranet could also be used for distance learning, conferencing, collaborative and other related purposes. 
With an Idaho Intranet, Idaho educators will have access to the next generation of teaching/learning tools and materials available under Internet2 (I2), to be used for K-12 and higher education. It will support continuing professorial education, as well as industry workforce development, training and re-training. 
With the Idaho Intranet, Idaho businesses will be able to take advantage of the advanced networking capabilities that is the goal of the I2 program. The Intranet would provide a tremendous opportunity to strengthen Idaho's rural economic base. The state's businesses will have access to ground floor participation in the next level of internet commerce. Abilene and vBNS will provide access to early product development, testing and market entry. Access to virtual conferencing would give businesses like Jerome Cheese Company in Jerome, Idaho, the opportunity to be in `real-time' video contact with its customers in Tokyo, Japan. 
Also, the Idaho Intranet will help telemedicine become a reality, improving rural healthcare and helping to address the shortage of doctors in rural Idaho. Idaho ranks last in the nation in numbers of doctors serving rural population healthcare needs--the national average is 93 physicians per 100,000 people. Idaho stands at 63 per 100,000, a third less than the national average, according to a recent study. We must change that and the Intranet will help. 
With this funding, the state's schools, colleges and businesses will have access to the I2 to test new products and materials. The UI WWAMI program, for example, is developing an advanced web site with videos of animal anatomy that will allow students to learn about anatomy without using live animals. Current internet technology is not adequate to handle the amount of information placed on the site, but I2 access will make it a viable educational tool available around the state. 
The result of an Idaho Intranet will be not only research and learning opportunities, but job creation and business competitiveness for the state of Idaho, and improved quality of life for the people of Idaho. It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I ask for the Senate's support for this project.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished floor manager of the bill a question. Potentially, one of the most important programs funded under the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations bill is the Information Infrastructure Grants program. This grants program recognizes the need for assistance to ensure that the American public has full access to and benefits from the technological advances that are taking place in telecommunications and networking. Certainly, the new universal service provisions will make many contributions to the K-12 education community, the library community and the health care community. But, there are also a number of other telecommunications and networking activities which could be of particular benefit, especially in some of the more rural states, such as mine. 
In my home State of Idaho, for example, the University of Idaho recently was awarded a vBNS high speed connections grant by the National Science Foundation and accepted an invitation to participate in the Internet2 program. This will give our university researchers access to databases throughout the nation and world, allow for remote use of scientific instruments and set the stage for many new collaborations. The UI has proposed establishing an Idaho Intranet to ensure that the people of rural Idaho will be able to benefit from the resulting access to education, medical information, and business opportunities, which are anticipated as a result of the advanced networking capacity. 
I believe the distinguished floor manager and his subcommittee have reviewed the information infrastructure grants program in some detail and believe it has a particular role to play in our telecommunications and networking efforts.

It would provide key communications links between the state's education institutions, businesses and state governments. Would you agree that the University of Idaho's proposal, to establish an Idaho Intranet and provide access to the benefits of the information and technology to be available under programs such as the vBNS and Abilene, is consistent with the Committee's proposals under the Information Infrastructure Grants program?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Market Access Program. This program continues to be a vital and important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and expanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm income and protecting American jobs. 
The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success by any measure. Since the program was established, U.S. agricultural exports have doubled. In Fiscal Year 1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 billion and contributing billions of dollars more in increased economic activity and additional tax revenues. 
For example, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture received $125,000 of Market Access Program funds during the past year. These funds were used to promote Idaho and Western United States agricultural products in the international markets of China, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. One particular activity, the promotion of western U.S. onions in Central America, required $15,000 of MAP funds and generated inquiries for onions valued at $150,000. 
Demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing 4 times greater in international markets than domestic markets. MAP has been an enormously successful program by any measure in supporting this growth. Since the program began in 1985, U.S. agricultural exports have more than doubled--reaching a record of nearly $60 billion dollars in 1996; contributing to a record agricultural trade surplus of $30 million; and providing jobs to over 1 million Americans. 
MAP is a key element in the 1996 Farm Bill, which gradually reduces direct income support over 7 years. Accordingly, farm income is now more dependent than ever on exports and maintaining access to foreign markets. 
Two years ago, European Union (EU) export subsidies amounted to approximately $10 billion in U.S. dollars. The EU and other foreign competitors also spent nearly $500 million on market promotion. The EU spends more on wine promotion than the U.S. spends for all its commodities combined. 
Mr. President, the Market Access Program should be fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition and protect American jobs.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have come to this floor today to talk about the state of American agriculture. Simply put, we are in a state of emergency. 
Whether it be low commodity prices, lack of export markets or too many government restrictions, farmers are facing catastrophes from every angle. If we are truly going to take steps to fix this problem, and not just use short-term fixes, we must to examine and correct the alarming rate at which children are leaving the family farm in pursuit of other occupations. 
Wilder, Idaho, is a small town in Idaho known for its fertile soil and exceptional growing conditions. Wilder is also the hometown of Idaho's distinguished governor, Phil Batt. In fact, Phil still lists his occupation as a farmer and can still be seen driving his pickup around the farm periodically. Wilder is also the home of the Churches--Tom and his son Mike. When Mike Church turned 18, he left for one of the most prestigious agriculture universities in the nation, Texas A&M, with the intention of getting his degree in agriculture economics and eventually returning to the land that his family has farmed for generations. Something happened to Mike while at A&M, he decided that he could not follow in his father's footsteps as a farmer. While studying agriculture balance sheets, Mike realized it was becoming more and more difficult for farmers across the country to break even, much less make a profit on their family farm. 
It's not that Mike didn't want to farm, the fact is he had worked on the farm since he was a young boy. Mike felt that the future was bleak in farming and had witnessed the struggles that Idaho farmers faced every day on the family farm. It was based on these realizations that Mike decided there was more of a future in speculating the paper commodities as a stockbroker than growing the actual commodities as a farmer. Twenty or thirty years ago it was understood that a son, or sometimes a daughter, would take over the family farm. This is no longer the case. 
If we are going to save the American family farm, we must start with the children who live on it. We must inspire the young people in our rural communities, like Wilder, to continue in the field of agriculture. Agriculture is not just about judging the weather anymore; the science of agriculture has become the cutting edge as we continue to compete against farmers in countries around the globe. 
This amendment provides much needed funding to an area that can and will inspire those young people to continue in farming. The Agriculture Education Competitive Grants Program would fund a competitive grants program for school-based agricultural education at the high school and junior college levels of instruction. The program was authorized in the 1996 Farm Bill. Competitive grants targeted to school-based agricultural education would be used to enhance curricula, increase teacher competencies, promote the incorporation of agriscience and agribusiness education into other subject matter, like science and mathematics, and facilitate joint initiatives between secondary schools, 2-year postsecondary schools, and 4-year universities. 
Most importantly, the program would encourage young people to pursue higher education in the food and agricultural sciences--something in which this country is currently making a failing grade. 
Mr. President, we must find a way to keep talented young people like Mike Church in the classroom and on the farm. The agriculture competitive grants program is the first step in that direction. This a bipartisan effort. Senator Craig, Senator Baucus, Senator Johnson, Senator Dorgan, Senator Thomas, and Senator Faircloth have all lent their cosponsorship to this amendment. It is through this bipartisan spirit that we can begin to bring the next generation of farmers back to the farm I thank my colleagues for joining in supporting my amendment to fund the Agricultural Education Competitive Grants Program.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, times are tough for Idaho's farmers right now. No one who has read a commodity report in the last few months would disagree. Wheat and barley prices are at record lows as are prices for other important Idaho agricultural products. Growers all over the state are on the verge of bankruptcy. This is an emergency. 
In a time when the situation is so desperate, eliminating a market that represents almost half of Idaho's white wheat exports could permanently cripple the grain industry in my state. 
That is why sanctions against countries such as India and Pakistan, at least those based on agricultural commodities, don't make sense. In fact, the only loser--the only group that will suffer as a result of the sanctions--will be America's farmers. 
While I completely understand the reasons behind sanctioning countries that violate the Arms Export Control Act, I cannot support punishing Idaho wheat farmers for the actions of foreign governments. This body cannot stand by while much of the nation's wheat crop is sitting in grain elevators. Closing an existing market to America's grain producers could have dire consequences. American wheat producers are already shut out of 20 percent of international markets. I believe that we need to expand new markets, not close off existing ones. 
It is for that reason that I am an original cosponsor of S. 2282, the Farmer Export Relief Act. This bill would send a strong signal to the international trade community that the United States will aggressively compete for commodity markets. 
The fact is, food should not be used as an economic weapon. The people of these countries, two of the world's largest, have to eat. There are 967 million mouths to feed in India, 135 million in Pakistan. That's over 4 times more mouths than we have here at home. 
Pakistan will soon make a $37 million purchase of white wheat. Our producers should be able to bid on that 13.5 million bushel sale. If they don't get their food from us, that void will quickly be filled by other nations with similar surplus problems. Pakistan is the third largest wheat export market for the United States. We can't allow such a big portion of exports to be handed over to our competitors. 
Bill Flory, an Idahoan, is the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. As a grain producer from Northern Idaho, Bill knows first hand the problems facing growers. Bill recently told me that the prices he is getting for his wheat are almost exactly the same as he was getting in the 1970's--almost thirty years ago. 
Mr. President, this is, indeed, an emergency. Idaho's grain farmers should not be punished for the actions of other nations. It is time for this body to come to the aid of American grain producers and lift the sanctions that don't hurt the violators, but instead only hurt our own farmers.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an Idahoan who has distinguished himself in both the public and private sector. 
Kirk Sullivan is retiring after 27 years with the Boise Cascade Corporation. But to simply say that Kirk enjoyed a long and productive career with a company is not adequate and doesn't do this outstanding individual justice. 
While not a native Idahoan, Kirk has worked most of his adult life to make the state a better place to live. And over the years he's dedicated himself to helping others. 
Idaho's children are of particular interest to Kirk. He has used his education and business experience to act as a tremendous resource to our children, from elementary school to the university level. 
As an active member of the Business Week Foundation, Kirk served as a mentor to Idaho high school students eager to learn how business operates and how to be successful in the workplace. 
As the founder of the Bishop Kelly Foundation, Kirk raised money for Boise's private high school. 
Kirk has not just played a supporting role in those ventures, nor in others. When Kirk sets out to do something, he takes charge. He actively raised money for the Children's Home Society of Idaho, he is leading a $500,000 fund drive for the Boise Master Chorale, and he raises funds for the University of Idaho. 
Kirk's boundless energy is contagious. I have seen him take on so many different issues and set lofty goals. He doesn't know the word `no.' When he's asked to do something, it is always `yes.' I've seen him gather some of the very talented people in the state of Idaho and tackle some of these major projects and come up with major results. It is so invigorating to see how he weaves your magic. 
In fact, even though Kirk Sullivan is not an alumnus of the University of Idaho, he has received the school's Presidential Citation for giving to the University and its community. 
I must add, Mr. President, that the University of Idaho is not the only beneficiary of Kirk Sullivan's efforts and enthusiasm. He has served as President of the Bronco Athletic Association at Boise State University and is currently a member of the Commission on the Future of Clemson University, his alma mater. He also is on Clemson's College of Engineering and Science Leadership Committee, with a fundraising goal of $100 million. 
So you can see, Mr. President, that Kirk and his wife, Betty, are valuable assets and cherished members of our community. 
While Kirk is retiring, I'm confident in the knowledge that his good works and commitment to his state will never wane. Idaho is a much better place because of the dedication and tireless efforts of Kirk Sullivan. 
I take pride in congratulating him today, and I know all Idahoans salute him.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (NCESGR)--its 4,200 volunteers and DoD staff --marking 25 years of service to this Nation. 
The National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve was established in 1972, the year the United States ended the Selective Service System and established an all-volunteer military force. The Department of Defense realized that a loss of support from employers and communities could be a roadblock to maintaining Reserve component membership. NCESGR was created to obtain employer and community support for the National Guard and Reserve and to promote the role of Reserve forces in the national defense. 
NCESGR has lived up to that task and accomplished much more. Since 1972, with the help of the Advertising Council, Inc., NCESGR has benefited from more than $591 million in pro bono advertising reaching the six million employers with one or more employees in the United States. 
Employers have, in turn, signed NCESGR Statements of Support, publicly committing to support the National Guard and Reserve. The former Chairman of the Board and CEO of General Motors, Mr. James H. Roche signed the first Statement of Support in the Office of the Secretary of Defense on December 13, 1972. The next day, President Richard Nixon signed a Statement of Support covering all Federal civilian employees. Since the inception of this program, Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton have all signed Statements of Support, along with hundreds of thousands of employers. To date, over 300,000 employers have signed statements of support. 
NCESGR offers Ombudsman services designed to provide information to employers and Reservists regarding their rights and responsibilities under the law and to resolve conflicts through informal mediation. This program is operated in cooperation with the Department of Labor, which is responsible for conducting formal investigations. Hundreds of thousands of hours and dollars are saved through the use of community volunteers. 
Mr. President, the National Committee for Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve is smart government in action. The small National Committee staff in Washington, DC, under the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, provides guidance and support to a network of 4,200 volunteer business, civic, and community leaders. 
These volunteers educate employers on their rights and obligations under the law and recognize employers who actively support employee participation in the National Guard and Reserve. Volunteers also educate members of the National Guard and Reserve regarding their rights and responsibilities and the value of employer support. Committees can be found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. 
With the end of the Cold War, the Reserve components have been called upon with increasing frequency. During the Gulf War in 1990-91, more than 250,000 Reserve component members were called to active duty to support military operations in the Persian Gulf. Last year, National Guardsmen and Reservists contributed nearly 13 million mandays in support of Active duty operations and exercises. 
Mr. President, thousands of employers, local and State government officials, Active and Reserve component leaders, and military members from across the Nation and around the world request NCESGRs employer support expertise on a daily basis. When National Guardsmen and Reservists return home following mobilization, ESGR committee members are there to provide information and support services to those in need.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and also Senator Coats for the particular comments he has made. 
Mr. President, I have been the chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee for the past two years, and in that time I have learned the subcommittee itself cuts a wide swath on all the issues that we deal with. This subcommittee resolves issues that are at the forefront of our national debate. We cope with the issues of values taught to our young people who volunteer for the armed services. We deal with the issues involving gender-based training, sexual harassment in the workplace, drug and alcohol abuse, and now, as a result of this amendment before the Senate, the very sensitive issue of abortion. 
Senators should know that this amendment is not a new issue. Last year the Senate extensively debated this issue, and defeated it on a 48-51 vote. I trust that the Senate will again defeat this amendment. 
My record on the issue of abortion is clear. Abortion is the most emotional, complex and personal issue before us today. Personally, I believe abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. In addition, I have consistently stated my belief that federal funds should not be used for abortions. In this regard, I have voted to maintain the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding of abortion except in cases where it is made known to appropriate authorities that the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. 
I make it very clear at the outset what this issue in this particular amendment is not about. It is not about whether you are pro-life or pro-choice. This amendment is about where those abortions may be performed and whether they are paid for at Federal Government expense. This amendment would repeal the prohibition on using Department of Defense facilities for abortions and allow prepaid abortions to be perform in these taxpayer-funded facilities and by Federal medical personnel at these facilities. 
The sponsors of this amendment argue that without this amendment, women in the Armed Forces stationed overseas may find it difficult to have access to a safe abortion. As a result, this interferes with their constitutional right to an abortion, so they contend. 
I want to acknowledge that women who are in the Armed Forces and are stationed overseas in countries where abortion is not legal, are faced with complex emotional and difficult decisions. I note for the record, however, that a woman with a pregnancy who is in the armed services who is overseas and that pregnancy is medically life-threatening or the result of rape or incest, under current policy, can receive an abortion at a U.S. military hospital. 
But there is no getting around the fact that the Department of Defense military hospital are paid with 100 percent taxpayer dollars. The medical facility is paid for with taxpayer money. The doctors and the nurses are Federal employees, paid with taxpayer dollars. So is the equipment, the overhead, the operating rooms, et cetera. 
Even though the pending amendment contemplates that women will be allowed to use personal funds to pay for an abortion, there is no getting around the fact that taxpayer dollars would still directly or indirectly pay for an abortion. So this amendment, if adopted, could lead to situations where taxpayers are paying for abortions, which is contrary to our national policy as outlined in the Hyde amendment. That is inconsistent with our national policy. 
To summarize, I would like to make a few important points on why I oppose this amendment. 
First, I believe it is accurate to state that our national policy, as reflected in legislation adopted by this Congress and signed into law, as embodied in the Hyde amendment, in essence states that we will not use Federal taxpayer money for abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or the life of the mother. 
Second, In 1980 the Supreme Court ruled on Harris vs. McRae, in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde amendment. 
Third, Congress, the President and the Supreme Court have set and affirmed the national policy that we not use Federal money to fund abortions except in those cases that I cited. 
Fourth, The Defense Department in their own analysis has said it would be an accounting nightmare to go through and determine the true cost of having an abortion performed in a U.S. medical facility when the facility is 100 percent taxpayer funded. All of the personnel, equipment and facilities are paid for by the taxpayers. 
Fifth, Current policy allows for a female member of the military service, in the event she chooses to have an abortion, to have access to military transportation so that she can go to a facility of her choice and exercise her constitutional right. Any military personnel has access to military transport on a space-available basis. The DOD has never had an instance where a woman who was seeking access on a space-available basis on military transport has been denied that because the purpose of her transport was for an abortion. 
Sixth, If a female member of the military service was in a life-threatening situation, an abortion could be performed at a US military hospital overseas. 
So I believe the current abortion policy at US military hospitals is consistent with over all national policy. 
Mr. President, I conclude by just stating I have the utmost respect for Senator Murray and Senator Snowe, the two Senators who have offered this amendment. I work with Senator Snowe on the Military Personnel Subcommittee. She does an outstanding job. What a great addition she is as we deal with these issues dealing with our armed services. 
I also affirm this significant fact: We could not operate as the leader of the free world without women in the military. We must have these outstanding, dedicated individuals as part of our military installations. I believe that the policy that is on the book does affirm certainly their constitutional rights, but it also affirms the national policy which I have stated, and it provides opportunities for them to exercise that. And in the case where it is life threatening, they certainly have the means with which they can deal with it in an appropriate fashion consistent with, I think, the caring of all human beings. 
So with that, Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will address the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-kempthorne-id-3-19980625</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
I will address a number of the issues that have been raised by the Senator from Nevada. He talks about this proposal by the Air Force to expand and enhance training at Mountain Home Air Force Base. It is a composite wing with F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, C-135 tankers. This is unusual, to have a composite wing. They are bedded down so that they train as they will fight. 
I think we know we have a troubled world out there. There is no longer the other big giant, the Soviet Union. We see the troubling headlines every day. It is a composite wing that would get the order--if we have to go into harm's way, there is a high likelihood they would be dispatched from Mountain Home Air Force Base--the finest pilots in the world, sending them into harm's way. 
I hope and pray that not only do we provide them the best equipment but also the best training opportunities, so that when those men and women get into that aircraft, they have every chance and opportunity to come back home to their loved ones after accomplishing what the U.S. Government sends them to do on behalf of the U.S. citizens. 
The characterization that this is just some guarantee of future Mountain Home Air Force Base, is that why this is one of the items in a priority of the President of the United States? Is that why the Secretary of Interior is part of this process? The acting Secretary of the Air Force? The director of the BLM? The director of the Council of Environmental Quality? The Secretary of Defense? Are they all in this together? Yes, they are, because we want to provide that sort of training opportunity for the composite wing. 
It happens to be located at Mountain Home Air Force Base. I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am proud of that assignment. Why did we put this legislation, this language from the Department of Interior and the Air Force, in the defense authorization bill? Because that is where the President puts the funds for the expansion and improvements to the training range. 
That seems rather logical to me. Governor Phil Batt, a Republican, during his entire term of office, has been working to make this project a reality from the State perspective. His predecessor, Governor Cecil Andrus, a Democrat, worked diligently and dedicated much of his time to bring this about to be a reality. We are finally going to make it a reality. Is it a Republican issue? Well, if it is, why is a Democrat administration making this such a priority? 
I ask the opponents of this: Have you called your President? Have you called your Secretary of Interior? Have you called your Secretary of the Air Force? Your director of the BLM? Your director of the Council of Environmental Quality? If you have, as I have, I think you will get a very clear message that this is a priority and this must and should go forward. 
On this idea that, by golly, we have shut everybody out, there have been 2 1/2 years of effort, Mr. President. This is the environmental impact statement. Yes, everybody was `shut out'--16 public hearings in 3 different States, over 400 witnesses, and over 1,000 comments are included in this. Show me the evidence that they were shut out. 
We talk about the Native Americans. The Senator from Nevada said, `Shouldn't they be part of the deal? Why were they ignored?' Well, I would like to, then, reference from the environmental impact statement a few of the meetings that were held between the Air Force and representatives of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe. I happen to have the utmost respect for members of the Shoshone-Paiute tribe. I worked with them. A number of them I consider friends. They are wonderful people. 
A meeting was held on 20 May, 1995; on 20 September, 1995; on 6 December, 1995; on 21 February, 1996; on 21 May, 1996; on 22 May, 1996; on 23 May, 1996; on 28 May, 1996; on 20 June, 1996; on 11 July, 1996; on 7 August, 1996; on 22 August, 1996; on 19 September, 1996; on 20 September, 1996; on 24 September, 1996; on 8 November, 1996; on 9 December, 1996; on 9 January, 1997; on 22 January, 1997; on 14 March, 1997; on 9 June, 1997; on 29 July, 1997; on 5 December, 1997; on 10 December, 1997; on 9 January, 1998; on 13 January, 1998. 
Isn't it a shame that they were ignored. There were 26 meetings. 
In a letter that the tribe sent to the Honorable Rudy De Leon, Under Secretary of the U.S. Air Force--included in this letter, Mr. President, they referenced the training range. They say, `In regard to the training range, enclosed as an attachment is a map with a shaded area running north and west from a reservation. This represents the area in which our sacred sites are located and, therefore, the area in which we oppose the creation of any training range, whether drop or no drop.' 
Included in this letter is this map. Now, I would like to point out that here is the Duck Valley Indian Reservation. Here is the Idaho-Nevada border. This map is the same as right here. They drew the line; the Native Americans drew the line and said, `Stay out of this area, please, because we have sacred sites, because this is critical to our culture.' So where is Juniper Butte, the 12,000-acre training range? Is it in that area? No. It is right there, right there. But nobody was listening. Where is the evidence? Who selected that site--Juniper Butte? Did this rancher come forward and say: Federal Government, would you please choose this site? No. It was the Bureau of Land Management. That was their proposed alternative. They 
suggested that. After a 2 1/2 -year process, the Air Force agreed that that is the best site. That is where you can do it. BLM recommended it; Air Force concurred. The rancher--or the `cowboy,' as the Senator from Nevada refers to him--didn't come forward and say, `I would like to do this.' The Air Force, from day 1, said they would compensate anybody who was adversely impacted. 
There is the land, 12,000 acres. That is where that family, for years, has been deriving their living. They put in extensive water pipes and fencing in this area. But now, because the Air Force needs it, yes, they are willing to be good citizens and say, all right, we will no longer utilize it as we have. But isn't it fair that they ought to be compensated for the pipelines and the fence, so they can be allowed to remain whole? There it is. 
Now, these beautiful pictures of the Owyhee Canyon lands are absolutely spectacular. The Senator from Nevada says that citizens, in trying to escape the daily clutter, go to these Owyhee Canyon lands. That is good. They should come there. They are welcome there. It is beautiful. He said that they would be devastated by this decision--devastated by this decision--because we are going to turn it into a bombing range. Over this beautiful, pristine canyonland, do you know what the current regulations are? Jets can fly at 100 feet above ground level, 100 feet above the canyon rim. With this agreement, they won't be able to do that. Right now, they can do that 365 days out of the year. With this agreement, during April, May, and June, they can only do it Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So that the recreationalists can enjoy the beautiful canyonlands and the water, it is just Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, not 7 days a week. Incidentally, it is not at 100 feet above the canyon rim, but 5,000 feet above the canyon rim, if they run parallel to the canyons, a mile on each side, 5,000 feet, or perpendicular at 1,000 feet. That is what you pick up with this. 
But if you don't like that, then go along with the Senator from Nevada and strike the language, and the pilots can again be at 100 feet above the canyon rim 365 days a year. 
We talk about sheep that are there; the Air Force provides $435,000 for 4 years so we can monitor the impact of this, the flights on the sheep as well as sage grouse. We have mitigation in place for spotted pepper grouse. 
Mr. President, I think we have a good program here. I think we have a good project. We talk about the training. 
Again, as members of the Armed Services Committee, we are very concerned about training and the amount of time that we can budget for our pilots actually to be in the air training--not in transit, training. That is the key--training. We have determined that their total combat training time more than doubles with this enhanced training range--more than doubles. Isn't that what we want for our pilots--to be training, so, again, as much as you hope and pray, they are not going to have to go into conflict with something crazy that happens somewhere in the world? But I will tell you, if they do, I don't want to be on the side that denied them the opportunity for adequate training. 
This proposal that predates my tenure in the U.S. Senate--it has been around many, many years, but it is time to bring it to a conclusion. That is what the President of the United States believes. That is what the Secretary of the Air Force believes, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Idaho delegation--Senator Craig, Congresswoman Chenoweth, Congressman Crapo--Governor Batt. It is time to do this and do what is right. 
Mr. President, I think that concludes my remarks at this point. I hope I have helped set the record straight. 
I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. 
Again, I remind you that this is not a partisan issue. I call upon my friends of the Democratic Party, certainly those on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to support this Air Force proposal, to support this administration proposal, so that we can do what is right, do what is right for the pilots, but do it in a sensitive fashion that is right for the environment and which also enhances the opportunities for recreation. 
I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada has been reading from an inspector general's audit. I believe the date on that is 1995. That particular project was the Idaho Training Range. It was a previous proposal that was rejected. This was a proposal which then-Governor Cecil Andrus worked extremely hard to bring about and should be commended for that. But again the specifics on that audit deal with ITR, the Idaho Training Range, and that is not the proposal before us today. 
He references official letters that I think are a couple years old, so let me read to you, if I may, a letter from the current Secretary of Defense, William Cohen. I will ask unanimous consent that this be made part of the record. 
It says: 
Thank you for your letter of September 8, 1997. I want to assure you nothing has changed regarding my enthusiasm for the Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) initiative. 
The 366th Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base is an important component of our military capability. As one of the first units to deploy to a problem area, it has the responsibility to neutralize enemy forces. It must maintain peak readiness to respond rapidly and effectively to diverse situations and conflicts. 
ETI balances realistic local training with careful consideration of environmental, cultural, and economic concerns. The elements of the ETI proposal, though designed to minimize environmental impacts, will simulate real world scenarios and allow the aircrews to plan and practice complex missions. In addition to providing realistic training, ETI's close proximity to Mountain Home Air Force Base also will enable the Air Force to convert time currently spent in transit into actual training time. Thus, the ETI proposal allows Air Force crews to use limited flight training hours more efficiently. 
I continue to give the ETI process my full support. It will provide our commanders with realistic training opportunities locally, while ensuring potential impacts to natural, cultural, social, and economic resources are identified and, where possible, cooperatively resolved. Your strong support for the ETI initiative is very important to us, and you may rely upon my continued interest and commitment. I trust this information is useful. 
Sincerely, 
Bill Cohen, Secretary of Defense. 
I also have a letter dated June 19, 1998, from the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, Whitten Peters, as well as the Secretary of Interior, Bruce Babbitt. I quote from that: 
Dear Senator Kempthorne: We are pleased to provide you with the attached legislation for the withdrawal of lands for the Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) project. As you know, this legislation represents three years of extensive work by the Bureau of Land Management, the Air Force, you, and other representatives of the people of Idaho, and many others who care about the welfare of Idaho's environment and the effectiveness of the 366th Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
ETI will increase the realism, flexibility, and quality of the Air Force's training. It permits the 366th Wing to train more efficiently and effectively for its important missions, thereby improving the aircrews' safety and mission performance. Implementation of ETI will substantially strength the 366th Wing's ability to ensure readiness to perform its assigned missions. 
Importantly, however, the Air Force and BLM also worked very hard so that ETI would balance training needs with the concerns of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, the environment, and other public land uses. The Air Force and BLM actively solicit public and agency involvement through the development of the project. Participants in the process included the State of Idaho, environmental organizations, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, ranchers, recreational organizations, and other users of the public lands in Idaho. 
The Air Force incorporated numerous mitigations in the design of the project to address public concerns and relocated facility sites during preparation of the environmental impact statement to avoid various environmental concerns expressed by the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes and others. Following completion of the EIS and consideration of public comment, the Air Force adopted further mitigation measures, including altitude and seasonal overflight restrictions that further address concerns of recreational users to protect the habitat of bighorn sheep. The NEPA process was a valuable tool in helping to identify these mitigations and resolve concerns. 
We believe the attached legislation accommodates many issues that you and other representatives of the people of Idaho have raised throughout the process and is an important step forward for national security, for the environment, and for significant tribal interests. 
The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the standpoint of the administration's program there is no objection to the presentation of this report to Congress. 
Sincerely,

My question is with regard to `fiscal year 1997,' since that is the previous year, if, in fact, this should read `fiscal year 1999.' If there is a need to make a correction here, I have no objection, because I don't want to have any parliamentary excuse used. I would like to have a fair vote here.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I offer my comments in my capacity as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
Subcommittee on Personnel. I have the utmost and profound respect for Senator Byrd, a man of tremendous integrity and motivation. 
Last year, when we established the commission that would deal with these issues that are very critical issues dealing with the military, the legislation which established it was an amendment that was crafted by Senator Byrd and by myself. I cannot turn my back on that commission at this point. 
A few weeks ago, there was a situation among those very talented commission members where some of them walked away. It looked as though the commission was going to collapse. I met with them, Senator Cleland met with them, Congressman Buyer met with them, and we urged them, because of the magnitude of the issues that they would be dealing with, that they come back together, give us guidance. 
For me to now say once you have been put back together, we are going to go ahead now with legislation, hope you concur--I really think if we go forward with this, we ought to consider disbanding the commission. 
Last night, in the course of debate, Senator Enzi made a very interesting point, and that was with regard to how many meters a grenade could be thrown and the standards by which a female would be required to throw the grenade versus how many meters a male soldier would be required to throw the grenade, and that there were differences and should there be differences. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, do you want to get into that debate? Do you really think we ought to be getting down to the details of how many meters a grenade should be thrown by a male soldier versus a female soldier, or are we going just a little too far in micromanaging? That is my concern. That is why on this commission we have outstanding individuals. We have retired Marine Corps generals, a sergeant major from the Army--we have folks who have been there. The physical training--how many push-ups should a man do versus a woman? Do you want to debate that? Do you want to get into that detail? 
We have a commission that has been appointed to do this. If that is not what we intended, the wisdom of this body that last year affirmed that commission, then we should have said so. We should have had this debate last year. We should have been up front about it, because if we are going to do this, if I were a commission member, I would say, `Here's my resignation.' 
I don't think that is what we are about, Mr. President. One of the things which I mentioned to that commission in the charge is do not ever, ever consider delivering to us, to this U.S. Senate, to the House of Representatives, what is, in your estimation, politically correct. We do not want to know what is politically correct with regard to the military of the United States. You tell us what is militarily correct for those men and women who wear the uniform. Don't tell us what is politically correct. This is not a social laboratory. This is the military. The courts have upheld that it is the military and things can be different. 
So let's do what is right, and let's not now make this U.S. Senate the governing body of all the details of how far the grenade should be thrown by a female soldier versus a male soldier, how many sit-ups they should do. We can enact the overall policy, but we have put talented people in place in the commission to do so. 
Please do not undo what you did last year. If you do, then ask yourselves, were we wrong last year? Was this deliberative body wrong, and we are admitting a mistake? I don't think so. 
I must, again, in my capacity as the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, support the commission which I helped create, because I have a belief that they will come back with recommendations which may well totally affirm what Senator Byrd is advocating tonight, totally affirm what Senator Brownback was advocating last night, perhaps even farther. But unless you want to get into how far to toss a grenade, I ask you not to pull the pin here tonight. 
And with that, I respectfully and regretfully have to oppose Senator Byrd's amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this Congress and the citizens of Idaho must seize a unique opportunity to pass legislation this year that will provide the ability to increase Idaho public education funding at least $20 million and possibly $30 million annually. And it will do so without raising taxes, cutting services or asking the federal government for one thin dime. 
This is no smoke and mirrors. 
This is creativity and innovation at its best. 
This legislation will empower Idaho to be better stewards of the endowment created 108 years ago that helps pay for Idaho's public education. By using prudent, time-tested investment strategies, the endowment will be better equipped to pay for teaching Idaho's children in the 21st century. 
Legislation I am introducing today with Senator Larry Craig will reform federal law that now restricts the way Idaho's Endowment Fund is managed. This legislation, along with constitutional amendments Idaho voters must approve in November, will modernize the legal framework of the endowment. According to financial experts, this legislative package will substantially increase funds available for Idaho school children. Specifically, this legislation gives greater flexibility for investing and managing endowment funds, and for managing the sale and lease of endowment lands. 
The bottom line is that the bill provides more money for educating our kids, money that can be used to buy computers, increase teachers' salaries, or buy new textbooks. 
And all this without raising taxes, cutting services or asking the federal government for one thin dime. 
I will work to get this bill passed in the Senate, in the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Clinton this year. 
Here is the background. 
In writing the 1890 law that made Idaho the 43rd state, the citizens of Idaho worked with Congress to set aside 3.5 million acres of land as a permanent endowment to help finance the education of Idaho children in the 20th century. 
Today this endowment is worth a combined total of $3.4 billion that consists of 2.5 million acres of land valued at $2.7 billion and an endowment fund worth nearly $700 million. In 1997, land and timber sales and investment interest generated $110 million of income. Of that, $55 million was reinvested into the endowment; $35 million was devoted to public schools and $10 million paid for other state endowments. 
But we can do even better for Idaho. 
In FY97, this $3.4 billion endowment earned $110 million, or a rate of return of just 3%. By virtually any investment standard, this is a low rate of return. If this rate increased by just one additional percent, to 4%, an extra $32 million would be created. 
The reason the Idaho Endowment Fund earned 3% and not any higher is because its investment and management structure is terribly outdated. The endowment was created in the 1800s when there was no developed securities market and before inflation became a major factor in investment decisions. As a result, the fund has no investment in equities or other higher yielding instruments. Right now, the endowment is exclusively invested in low yielding debt instruments like government securities, mortgages, and corporate bonds. 
Right now, the law requires the endowment to be managed the way land and money were managed in 1890, not in the 1900s. That's like keeping laws on the books that restrict the delivery of health care to procedures and drugs that were available in 1800s. 
The problem is simple. Current laws keep Idaho from earning higher rates of return. This results in less money being available for school children who do not received as much as they might, and it requires their parents to pay more taxes to make up the difference. While this problem is simple, so is the solution. And that is to allow the fund to be invested in a broader array of investments and require that investments must follow what is known as the `prudent investor' test. This test requires managers to use reasonable care and caution in making investment decisions. 
In addition, both current federal law and the Idaho State Constitution contains provisions that restrict the ability of the land trust to maximize the sale and management of the endowment lands. 
If prudent, time-tested investment strategies were applied to the land trust and endowment fund, financial experts agree that rates of return would increase, investment risk would decrease, and fluctuations in annual cash flows would be eliminated. 
The bottom line is this: More money for Idaho school children. And less taxes for their parents. 
Congress and the citizens of Idaho must work together to prepare the Idaho Endowment to meet the needs of children in the 21st century. 
That's the goal of the legislation Senator Craig and I are introducing today. 
Section Five of the original Idaho Admissions Act of 1890 created the endowment fund, and rules governing sale and lease of endowment land. 
The measure we are introducing today will replace Section 5 with a new section that gives land and investment managers greater flexibility in managing both the endowment land and endowment funds. Here is how: 
Under current law, income from lands sales can only be placed in the endowment fund. Once placed in the endowment fund, funds cannot be used to buy land, even if doing so will ultimately produce more funds for education. 
To provide more flexibility for land sales, legislation we are introducing today would give the state the authority to establish a new land bank fund which can be used to purchase additional land. For example, this land bank would allow the state to sell land that is difficult to manage in order to purchase land of higher functionality and greater investment return. 
Under current law, no flexibility exists for managing endowment fund cash flow. 
The legislation we are introducing today establishes an Earnings Reserve Fund. This earning reserve can be managed in a way that insures a steady, and likely higher source of funds for public education than what is now provided. With this earnings reserve in place, the assets of the endowment are placed in investments that over time have higher yields than less fluctuating, lower yielding investments. This reserve fund gives investment managers greater flexibility that have higher returns and facilitate a steadier and higher stream of distributions. 
Under current law, there is a 10-year limit on leases of endowment lands. 
The Craig-Kempthorne legislation repeals the 10-year limit, and allows the state land board to establish agreements that will maximize the long-term financial return on any lease that is made. This provision makes the management of lands available for education purposes on equal footing with the management of land in other endowments. 
These changes may sound technical but in truth bring common-sense to managing the Idaho Endowment. The endowment, if it were created today, would be managed as a whole, and would have a diversified mix of equity assets, with smaller portions of fixed income and real estate. In addition, cash flow would be better regulated to meet a more consistent, and higher, level of distributions. This is the overwhelming practice of most endowments. 
Instead, the Idaho Endowment is two separate entities, the land trust and the endowment fund. There is currently little coordination between these two entities, and each part of the endowment is concentrated in a particular type of asset. The land trust is dominated by timber, and the financial assets are exclusively fixed income, lower-yielding assets. There is currently no management of the distributions of overall cash flow and the investment policy has no long-term investment strategy, or prudent management of cash flow or a policy to decrease the concentration of assets to reduce investment risk. This is an outdated investment strategy. And there is now no comprehensive plan for the entire trust. 
Governor Phil Batt appointed a committee of financial experts and public officials to review the endowment and land trust. This committee, chaired by Douglas Dorn, reviewed the endowment and the trust, and made a number of recommendations. Of particular importance, the committee recommended and concluded that the endowment should be managed as one fund by one governing body that would decide overall investment strategy using modern day so-called prudent investor investment strategies. 
The creation of the land bank and the earnings reserve are key elements of this strategy. That is what this legislation provides, and I urge the Senate to adopt this bill at the first opportunity. And I will be urging the citizens of Idaho to do their part this November and vote for the constitutional amendments that are needed to modernize the legal framework of the Endowment. 
I commend Governor Batt for his leadership and innovation in developing this legislative package which will clearly benefit Idaho children. I also want to commend Doug Dorn, and his committee of Rep. William L. Deal, State Controller J.D. Williams, Robert Montgomery, Dr. Thomas Stitzel, Robert Maynard, Michael Brassey, Clive Strong and Michael Ferguson for their effective and bipartisan work. 
Today we see the results of the wisdom and foresight of the decisions made 100 years ago by Congress and the citizens of Idaho. I trust this Congress and the citizens of Idaho will match the wisdom of their predecessors, and adopt this legislative package which will provide more money so we can teach our children well.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, in the defense bill we have language dealing with land withdrawal. This is a project that the Air Force has been working on for some years. The language that I have now proposed to the Senate is the perfecting language which has been provided to us. 
Madam President, this concerns the 366th Composite Wing which is bedded down at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This is a composite wing that consists of F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, and C-135 tankers. This allows them to train as they fight. This is one of our rapid deployment Air Force units that would be called to respond anywhere in the world where we may have a terrible situation. 
The current range that we have in place, there is only one direction--that is from the south--from which you can access that range. That worked when this was not a composite wing, but now that you have all of these different aircraft there, they need to have much greater ability for training purposes. This would allow us to maximize training for this situation. 
After many, many months of a process, I will tell you that this is something that has been a high priority for the White House, for the Air Force, for the Department of the Interior, for BLM, for the Governor of the State of Idaho, and for the Idaho delegation. 
With regard to the process, Madam President, this is a process that has taken 2 1/2 years to get us to this point-- 2 1/2 years. During those 2 1/2 years, 16 different public hearings were held in three different States. Over 400 witnesses testified as to their thoughts, either pro or con, mitigations they would suggest. Over 1,000 different comments were recorded. 
This is the Environmental Impact Statement that is the result of 2 1/2 years of effort, three volumes. Included in the first volume is the reference that `The final EIS has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act,' or NEPA. So, again, this is a process that has been in place, that has followed all of the guidelines. And really I think the Air Force and the Department of the Interior are to be commended for the process which they have utilized, and really the mitigations that have been put into place are some of the most significant the Air Force has ever had. Also, the Air Force had no less than 25 meetings with tribal representatives of the Shoshone-Paiute tribe. Their reservation is Duck Valley. 
The particular site that was chosen, Madam President, 12,000 acres, is currently under ownership by the Bureau of Land Management. When we talk about land withdrawal, who are we withdrawing it from and who becomes its new landlord? Well, currently, because it is BLM, it is Federal land. It will remain Federal land. It is being withdrawn from the BLM to be put under the stewardship of the U.S. Air Force. 
I would like to give you a sense of what this issue is about. In this particular area of the State, these are what are called the Owyhee Canyonlands. As you see, they are beautiful. You can see the streams going through there. 
Currently, in this area, we have the Mountain Home Air Force Base, and under existing regulation those aircraft can fly at 100 feet above the canyon rim or 100 feet above ground level 365 days out of the year. With this proposal that is before the Senate, in this legislation that changes. For 3 months out of the year--April, May and June--those aircraft, instead of flying at 100 feet above the canyon rim, if they fly parallel to the canyon, would be at 5,000 feet, and that is 1 mile from the canyon either side. If they fly perpendicular, across the canyon, they would be at 1,000 feet--significant improvements. Also, during those months they would only fly Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday--not 7 days a week. So for recreationalists, this is a real advantage that is gained by them. 
Now, when we talk about 12,000 acres, is it this same sort of beautiful landscape as we see here? Let me show you. 
This is a picture of the 12,000 acres. As you can see, it is sparse. It is flat. This is where for 100 years they have been grazing cattle. Folks out there work hard to make a living on this land. But this is the picture of the 12,000 acres that are out there now. 
Also, when I mentioned the Shoshone-Paiute tribes, one of the things that was asked of our Native Americans--and this is the Duck Valley Reservation, which is in this southwest corner of the State of Idaho, and also in Nevada--but we asked them what areas of concern they would have, what geographic areas of concern that they would have for some of their sacred areas. 
They drew this line and said, anything in here we would certainly prefer that you not have this training facility in. And, therefore, Juniper Butte, which is the land in question, is right here. As you can see, it is a great deal outside the area of concern of the Native Americans. 
The funds for the improvements and for land acquisition for this project have been provided by President Clinton in his defense bill that is before us. It is included in the Department of Defense authorization bill, so it is very logical and consistent for us to deal with this project in the same legislation that has the funding for this project. That is what is before us at this point. 
The result of this is that there will be: A new, no-live-ordnance, 12,000-acre training range using land that has been grazed for over 100 years; the most extensive mitigation program in the history of the Air Force; new seasonal overflight restrictions of the canyons for recreationalists and sheep; an Air Force commitment to provide $430,000 over 4 years to monitor impacts on bighorn sheep and sage grouse; avoidance of the entire sacred site area identified by the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes at the start of the process and protection of existing sacred sites; Air Force agreement with ranching operation impacted by land withdrawal. The Juniper Butte Range is supported by letters from Defense Secretary Bill Cohen, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and Air Force Secretary--Acting Secretary Whitten Peters, and Idaho Governor Batt. 
The Air Force, from the outset, said if, in the area that they ultimately chose as the approved site for this training range, there were people who might be adversely impacted, that the Air Force would compensate. This agreement would allow for compensation to be a result of the agreement negotiated between the Air Force and, in this case, a ranching family. We have a rancher who, for years, has been grazing his cattle on these 12,000 acres and has made a great many improvements with regard to the water lines and fencing. So as he moved those water lines and the fencing to a different location, again, he would be compensated for this and he would have those grazing areas realigned in a different location. So, again he would be leaving that area. 
The language that we have before the Senate is language that was given to us by the Department of the Interior, by BLM, and by the U.S. Air Force. 
I will tell you, Madam President, that there are a couple of items which have been added to the Kempthorne-Craig amendment which are a substitute for the language in the bill. Again, the language comes from the Department of the Interior and the Air Force, and there are four additional changes. 
No. 1, the impacted rancher may continue to graze the withdrawn land until his agreement with the Air Force is fully implemented; that is, until rights-of-way are granted and new fences and water pipes are built. 
We cleared this with Katie McGinty, who is the President's counsel on environmental quality. The White House is very comfortable with this language. 
No. 2, to the maximum extent possible, Interior should use maps already bought and paid for in development of the EIS, just trying to avoid further costs of the project. 
No. 3, we add Owyhee County to the development of the resource management plan for withdrawn lands and monitoring activities. 
No. 4, we change water right language from the Air Force `may' not seek water rights to the Air Force `shall' not seek water rights. 
The substitute amendment will result in development of the Juniper Butte Range. I think this is an important distinction. That is, that particular site was recommended by the Bureau of Land Management after a lengthy process, which I have outlined; the Air Force then concluded that was the best site. It was not a situation where the rancher came forward and said, is there any way that the Federal Government could somehow come and utilize this land? This was something that was driven by, No. 1, the Air Force wanting to have this enhanced training for the Composite Wing at the Air Force base, the Bureau of Land Management choosing the Juniper Butte site, the Air Force ultimately agreeing to it, and then a whole series of mitigations have been put in place. 
The amendment sets no precedent on grazing rights, as is acknowledged by the Bureau of Land Management. I think that is an important distinction. 
So this is perfecting language. It, again, is a process that has taken 2 1/2 years, three volumes that are contained in the environmental impact statement following NEPA. It has the strong support of the President of the United States, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the Governor of the State of Idaho, the Idaho delegation. 
Again, I appreciate all the cooperation we have had and the strong support from the administration on bringing this project, finally, to closure. 
With that, I know the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, has some comments he would like to make on this amendment as well.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I want to report that there are some members who believe the proposed substitute amendment #2892 sets a new standard for environmental remediation before the Air Force can relinquish the withdrawn lands back to the Bureau of Land Management. Like I did with the Department of Interior, the BLM and the Air Force regarding the new overflight restrictions of the canyons, I will convene a meeting with all of the interested parties and committees to try to reach a consensus on this issue before completion of the conference on this bill. 
Madam President, I would just like to say, after months and months of due process, I think we are doing what is right by the environment, what is good for recreation, and certainly what is right for the pilots. 
When we think of those pilots who have to climb into those aircraft, if we do have to send them into harm's way, let us make sure we provide them with not only the best aircraft in the world but the best training opportunities, so that when they go into harm's way, they can come back to their loved ones in good shape. 
So I want to thank Senator Craig for his partnership. He has been a tremendous partner, as has Congresswoman Chenoweth, Congressman Crapo, Governor Batt. And, again, there are folks who do not like this--didn't like it from the outset, don't like the conclusion, don't like the answer. But the process has been fulfilled, and the conclusion, I believe, is right. 
I just want to say to the family of the Bracketts, the ranchers who have been working with us on this, I appreciate their willingness to go through this process. Again, they did not come forward; they did not step up and say, `Boy, why don't you use this land.' I think out of their belief in Idaho and their belief in the country, they are willing to go along with this. But in this very public process, unfortunately, some people lodge charges that bring into question the integrity of some individuals. I think that is just very unfortunate. That happens in the political process. Perhaps we get used to it a little more, but I hate to see it when it is leveled at a good family like this. So I appreciate the Brackett family. 
Again, I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member's comments. And I believe, unless there is further debate, we are ready for a vote.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, would you please notify me when I have consumed 4 minutes? 
Mr. President, when you spoke so eloquently here, you said that Senator Brownback's amendment could be summarized in that the men and women should not be housed together. I totally agree, 100 percent; men and women should not be housed together. I think that the Senator from Maine agrees with me. There is no argument here. 
But when we talk about separate housing, I don't know that necessarily has to mean separate buildings, because when you look at the configuration of many of our structures out there--I agree with what Senator Brownback said, which was very effective. This idea that somehow you are going to use a plywood partition to separate, that is wrong. It ought to be permanent. You ought to have separate entrances. You ought to have separate common areas. You ought to have that. We should have that. 
But I believe that it is not necessary to go as far as Senator Brownback at this point. I think that can be created with existing structures. If not, then let's go ahead with the separate. But, you see, we are presupposing here. 
When we talk about the terrible incidents that have happened--and they are absolutely deplorable, deplorable. But I think in one of the cases that was referenced, a Navy drill instructor committed sexual misconduct with some of these individuals. But in none of those cases did the incidents take place in the sleeping bay of the barracks. It took place in the office of the drill instructor. It took place in the motel down the road. It is not in the bays. 
The idea that we cannot allow a drill instructor--I don't know how far that goes. Can the commanding officer enter the drill bay to have a meeting with the recruits, if he is escorted by someone of the same sex, who are in the barracks? I think that should be allowed. But I don't know that it is allowed here. 
I am just concerned that perhaps we have gone a little far. 
We have talked about the Kassebaum-Baker Commission. Do you know that they did not look at the advanced training? They 
looked strictly at basic. 
Why do I make that point? It is because it was at the advanced training at Aberdeen. That is where all of these incidents take place--advanced training. 
We have put together a very effective group of commission members. It was a Kempthorne-Byrd amendment that created the commission. So I can't turn my back on that commission. That would be wrong. I am not going to turn my back on the Senator from Maine or the Senator from Georgia. That would be wrong. We created a commission in the Armed Services Committee. 
You may have seen, Mr. President, a few weeks ago the commission was about ready to split. Four were going to walk. Congressman Buyer and I met with them and said, `Don't do this. Don't rule yourselves irrelevant. There is such a critical reason for this commission to exist. Stay together. Give us the answers.' Now I am supposed to say to that commission, `Oh, by the way, thanks for staying together, but we don't need your conclusions, because we are going to go ahead with all of this legislation, because I believe there is an amendment ready to come forward that is going to be removing integrated training.' 
Mr. President, I am going to repeat what you said. Men and women should not be housed together. No argument. No argument. But I believe we can accomplish that in the existing structure. 
I also think we have to support a commission that was put in place. 
Again, I want to compliment the Senator from Kansas. He has brought a meaningful issue before us. He has been articulate about it. Senator Brownback does a good job, but I think he has gone just a little far in this. Does separate housing mean you have to have separate housing and the cost that goes with that? 
I know the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, a member of the subcommittee, also would like to speak. I would like to turn my time over to him.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would to take a moment to speak about the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, in Frederick, Maryland, which I recently had the great honor of once again visiting. 
On September 17, 1862, the Union and Confederacy engaged in a massive engagement at Sharpsburg, Maryland, which was also known as the Battle of Antietam, so named after the small creek around which Union troops were consolidated. Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his 40,000 Southern troops were pitted against Federal General George B. McClellan and 87,000 Union soldiers. Quotations researched by the Antietam National Battlefield staff and volunteers help us visualize the battle and its toll. 
On the forenoon of the 15th, the blue uniforms of the Federals appeared among the trees that crowned the heights on the eastern bank of the Antietam. The number increased, and larger and larger grew the field of the blue until it seemed to stretch as the eye could see, and from the tops of the mountains down to the edges of the stream gathered the great army of McClellan: Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, CSA, Commander, Longstreet's Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. 
We were massed `in column by company' in a cornfield; the night was close, air heavy . . . some rainfall . . . The air was perfumed with a mixture of crushed green corn stalks, ragweed, and clover. We made our beds between rows of corn and would not remove our accouterments: Private Miles C. Huyette, Company B, 125th Pennsylvania Infantry. 
Suddenly a stir beginning far up on the right, and running like a wave along the line, brought the regiment to its feet. A silence fell on everyone at once, for each felt that the momentous `now' had come: Pvt. David L. Thompson, Company G, 9th New York Volunteers. 
In the time that I am writing every stalk of corn in the northern and greater part of the field was cut as closely as could have been done with a knife, and the slain lay in rows precisely as they had stood in their ranks a few moments before. It was never my fortune to witness a more bloody, dismal battlefield: Maj. General Joseph Hooker, USA, Commander, I Corps, Army of the Potomac. 
Antietam became the bloodiest day in American history. At 
the close of the day, more men were wounded or killed at Antietam than on any other single day of the Civil War: 12,410 Union troops, and 10,700 Confederates. 
Whether Union or Confederate, when a soldier fell on the battlefield, he was an American. Frederick, Maryland, was the recipient of the thousands of fallen soldiers. 
The National Museum of Civil War Medicine, in Frederick, seeks to highlight the sacrifice made by countless American soldiers in their quest to advance the values of this great nation that was, as Abraham Lincoln explained, `conceived in liberty.' In fact, those slain on the battlefield at Antietam were prepared for burial in the very building that now houses the National Museum of Civil War Medicine.  
The force of a mini ball or piece of shell striking any solid portion of a person is astonishing; it comes like a blow from a sledge hammer, and the recipient finds himself sprawling on the ground before he is conscious of being hit; then he feels about for the wound, the benumbing blow deadening sensation for a few moments. Unless struck in the head or about the heart, men mortally wounded live some time, often in great pain, and toss about upon the ground: History of the 35th Massachusetts Volunteers. 
Under the dark shade of a towering oak near the Dunker Church lay the lifeless form of a drummer boy, apparently not more than seventeen years of age, flaxen hair and eyes of blue and form of delicate mould. As I approached him I stooped down and as I did so I perceived a bloody mark upon his forehead . . . It showed where the leaden messenger of death had produced the wound that caused his death. His lips were compressed, his eyes half open, a bright smile played upon his countenance. By his side lay his tenor drum, never to be tapped again: Pvt. J.D. Hicks, Company K, 125th Pennsylvania Volunteers. 
`It is well war is so frightful,' General Lee wrote, `otherwise we should become too fond of it.' Indeed, this museum allows the visitor to get a feel for the ravages of war. Located in the museum are numerous exhibits detailing how Civil War-era doctors and nurses dealt with the wounded and near-dead who were brought off the battlefield to be cared for. 
Comrades with wounds of all conceivable shapes were brought in and placed side by side as thick as they could lay, and the bloody work of amputation commenced: George Allen, Company A, 6th New York Volunteers. 
The former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett 
Koop, has remarked that the Civil War represented a `watershed in American medical history.' The visitor to this museum becomes keenly aware of this, and learns of Civil War-era medical advances in the fields of anesthesia, surgery, sanitation, and the introduction of mobile medical corps to the armed forces. 
Mr. President, I find that I have a personal bond to the town of Frederick, this museum, and what it represents. My great-grandfather, Charles Kempthorne, was a member of Company Three of the Third Regiment of the Wisconsin Infantry Volunteers. He, like many other brave soldiers, was wounded on September 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam. It was in the town of Frederick that his wounds were treated and he began his convalescence. In time he was transferred to Washington, D.C., where he served until he was honorably discharged on June 29, 1864. 
Commemoration is indeed an important duty, not only to honor the dead, but also to keep alive the ideals that they died for. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that the National Museum for Civil War Medicine has undertaken the important task of remembering a crucial component of Civil War history. 
I would like to commend those people who have made the National Museum of Civil War Medicine a reality. Dr. Gordon E. Dammann, Dr. F. Terry Hambrecht, JaNeen Smith, Debbie Moone, and volunteers Dianne Marvinney, Rebecca Coffey, Bill Witt, among many others, are doing an excellent job with the museum. 
On behalf of my great-grandfather, Charles Kempthorne, I say thank you to the community of Frederick for its compassion so many years ago, and as a citizen I commend the National Museum of Civil War Medicine for helping those of us today realize that the cost of freedom did not come easy, but was often achieved with the loss of blood and life by brave Americans on both sides. 
Both before and after a battle, sad and solemn thoughts come to the soldier. Before the conflict they were of apprehension; after the strife there is a sense of relief; but the thinned ranks, the knowledge that the comrade who stood by your side in the morning never will stand there again, bring inexpressible sadness--Charles Carleton Coffin, Army Correspondent, Boston Journal.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a patriot and one of this nation's finest military leaders, General Eugene E. Habiger, who is retiring at the end of June, 1998. Since 1996, General Habiger has served as the Commander in Chief of United States Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. 
General Habiger's career in the military began in 1959 when he enlisted as an infantryman in the U.S. Army. After his tour in Fort Benning, Georgia, he attended the University of Georgia earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1963. After college, Gene joined the Air Force and upon completion of Officer Training School in September 1963, he was selected as a distinguished graduate. 
Soon after leaving Officer Training School, as a young Captain and B-52 Aircraft Commander, Gene flew 150 combat missions and participated in the B-52 Arc Light operations during the Vietnam War. In the early 1980s, he commanded the 325th Bombardment Squadron and later served as assistant deputy commander for operations, 92nd Bombardment Wing, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. 
In the late 1980s, Gene commanded the 379th Bombardment Wing at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan, and the 2nd Bombardment Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. In the 1990s, Gene's command experience served him well as vice commander, Headquarters Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas; and as Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. 
The apex of General Habiger's career came with his current assignment as Commander in Chief, United States Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The command has responsibility for all U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy strategic nuclear forces. These powerful forces act as this Nation's strategic deterrent. 
During his command at USSTRATCOM, General Habiger made major contributions to the national security of the United States by establishing the parameters for future strategic forces and possible arms control agreements. His leading role in managing a stable drawdown of nuclear forces helped foster mutual understanding and cooperation with Russia. In addition, his cooperative efforts with the Department of Energy shaped the process by which the United States will maintain the long term safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile. As the Department of Energy's customer, General Habiger insured the Stockpile Stewardship Program is programmed and funded to develop the new tools, technologies, and concepts to ensure our strategic forces remain safe, effective, ready, and responsive to changing needs. 
In addition, Gene was a premier player in shaping our strategic force structure. His team completed a very detailed analysis of United States' Strategic Force Structure options reaching far beyond START II. This unprecedented target-by-target scrub of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) helped shape the conceptual and practical character of post-Cold War US nuclear weapons policy that will be instrumental in decisions for years to come. 
Convinced that the Nation's security is best served by a stable strategic relationship with Russia, General Habiger was a forceful spokesman for the START II Treaty and Defense Department Cooperative Threat Reduction activities. Twice, he accompanied the Secretary of Defense to Moscow to meet with the Russian Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces stressing the political, economic, and military importance of ratifying START II for both the United States and Russia. Gene's work on a post-START II nuclear arms control agenda was reflected in national policy, and helped form the basis for portions of the START III framework announced at the Presidential Summit in Helsinki, in March 1997. 
Undoubtedly, General Habiger has been the unparalleled leader in expanding military-to-military contacts with Russian counterparts, particularly the Strategic Rocket Forces. These actions established a more stable relationship with Russian leadership. As evidence of the high regard and confidence in which General Habiger is viewed in Russia, he was the first non-Russian to enter a Russian nuclear weapons storage area. His ceaseless efforts in establishing good relations with Russia have significantly improved communication and understanding. For the first time in history, as Commander in Chief of the US nuclear arsenal, he can pick up the phone and talk directly to senior Russian military leadership. 
General Habiger and his wife, Barbara, have two sons, Karl and Kurt. I am sure Gene and Barbara have ambitious plans for their life after military service and I hope they make the most of this time. From a private in the U.S. Army to a four star general in the U.S. Air Force, General Habiger has served our military and the Nation with great honor and distinction. I have the pleasure of calling Gene Habiger a friend and I want to thank him for his contribution to our nation's security.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you. 
With this amendment we are debating today, which is a critical amendment, we will bring the last significant aspect of our Federal Tax Code that is of particular concern to Idahoans, and I think really all Americans, and that is the marriage tax penalty. 
I ask myself one fundamental question before I make up my mind on any issue we deal with on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is, Does this policy make sense for the American people? 
Let's apply this question to our current Federal Tax Code which, quite simply, penalizes a working couple for getting married. Should folks pay more tax because they are married? Absolutely not. 
The marriage tax penalty raises revenue for the government--no question about that. It raises revenue. But it is bad public policy. It most often raises taxes on lower and middle-income families who claim the standard deduction. Now, that is wrong. We must strengthen the bonds of family to strengthen the fabric of our society. If we believe in family, we believe in marriage. So why in the world do we have a public policy on the books that somehow creates a penalty for being married? That is totally counterproductive to our values of this society, of this Nation. 
Before 1969, marriages were treated by the Federal Tax Code like partnerships, allowing husbands and wives to split their income evenly. In 1969, however, this practice of income splitting was ended, and thus was created the marriage tax penalty. 
Since that time, with our Nation's progressive tax rates, tax laws have meant that working married couples are forced, forced to pay significantly more money in taxes than they would if they were both single. Currently, 42 percent of married couples suffer because of the marriage tax penalty. 
Let me provide an example. A single person earning $24,000 per year is taxed at a 15 percent rate. Now, if two people, each earning $24,000, get married, however, the IRS, by taxing them on their combined income, taxes them in the 28 percent bracket, not the 15 percent that they would be taxed as individuals, but 28 percent because they have joined in holy matrimony. 
It is also important to be aware that the marriage tax penalty hits the American people not only at the Federal level but also on their State taxes. Idaho generally conforms its State tax code to the Federal law. If the Federal Government alters its standard deduction levels, for instance, Idaho most likely will as well. While the focus of ending the marriage tax penalty has been primarily at the Federal level, we cannot discount the fact that this is, in essence, a double hit for working American couples who are trying to fulfill what this country believes in. 
I think that we can all agree that the Federal Government should not be penalizing marriages, a sacrosanct institution and the bedrock of our social structure. It is time for the Federal Government to end this injustice to the American family. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. I commend him for his efforts. 
Mr. President, just to reiterate, we think about this society and we think about all the problems and challenges that are facing America today. Senator Frist of Tennessee was chairman of a task force on education in America. He pointed out many of the statistics, many of the problems that we are having with regard to our children. He pointed out how many of these children, more and more, are coming from families where there is not both a father and a mother. That is a significant problem--a significant problem. 
How do we respond with public policy? Well, if you are married, there will be a penalty. I happen to be the chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. We are starting to have problems with recruitment of young people to the military services. We need 176,000 young people every year to join the military--the finest military in the world. At one of the hearings, I asked the generals and admirals testifying this: `Tell me, is there something about this issue of values that we are hearing about?' And they said: `Yes, there is; there is very much a problem with values among all people.' In fact, all branches of the military services have now added 1 week to the basic training to try to somehow instill in them core values--knowing right from wrong. A three-star general of the Marine Corps said, `We now have a new category of young person; we just call them `evil,' and there is nothing we can do with them.' 
As the occupant of the Chair knows, it used to be that if you had a troubled youth, in all likelihood if you could send them off to the military, they would be straightened out. That is not the case anymore. I mention these challenges because it comes back. Do any of us believe that 1 week of basic training with 17- and 18-year-olds is somehow going to instill in them the values they should have learned many, many years ago, that they should have been raised upon, knowing right from wrong? That comes from a family environment, a family environment where a mother and father are there, where mother and father will tuck the child into bed, where mother and father will listen to their prayers--a mother and father, a married couple. 
Yet, we have public policy on the books today that penalizes married couples. That is wrong; that is flawed public policy. It is time that this Nation correct that. That is why I am proud to stand in support of this amendment that will correct this. It is a clear signal, a loud signal, that we are going to reclaim this society and the fabric of this society by affirming that marriage is positive; we will not penalize those who choose to go into marriage. 
So, again, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment by the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, nearly fourteen years ago President Reagan signed P.L. 98-244, an act to establish the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation as a charitable, nonprofit corporation of the United States specifically to further the conservation and management of the Nation's fish, wildlife, and plant resources. Since that time, the Foundation has funded more than 2,200 conservation projects through their partnership and challenge grant program. 
In the State of Idaho alone, the Foundation has funded nearly 100 projects worth over $19,000,000. The good news is that they have done this work with only $5M of federal money. That is nearly a four to one contribution from the private sector. In addition, there have been many projects in adjacent States that benefit the Stat of Idaho. 
But the Foundation has had its share of controversy. A Foundation grant to the Pacific Rivers Council may have allowed the Pacific Rivers Council to use other resources to nearly shut down the economy of several counties in the State of Idaho. A federal judge shut down all permitted activities in our national forests when the Pacific Rivers Council brought suit against the United States Forest Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service for failure to consider cumulative impacts of permitted activities under the Endangered Species Act. The two agencies could not agree on the extent and nature of the consultations, so the Federal judge shut down all activities in our national forests until they were in compliance. Even the plaintiffs in the suit were surprised by the effect of their suit. They quickly joined the effort to reverse the injunction and to have the two Federal agencies agree on a solution. 
Since then the Foundation has implemented procedures into its grant contracts to prevent a recurrence of the devastating injunction triggered by the Pacific Rivers Council. The Foundation has repeatedly stated that `it does not engage in lobbying or litigation and does not allow its grants to be used for those activities.' 
And, I recognize that the Foundation has provided grant monies to support studies of grizzly bears and wolves in the Pacific Northwest. However, in my review of those grants I am pleased to say that the grants have been used to discover basic biological information about these predators. The Foundation has produced educational materials, backed research on the impacts of human activities, improved sanitation and safety will bear-proof dumpsters, supported GIS mapping of bear habitats, and brought in non-federal partners. 
During the years I have been acquainted with the Foundation, I have found that they work with the entire spectrum of interests to leverage through private partners a limited amount of federal funding into significant monies for conservation.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I stand today as the sponsor of Senate Resolution 201 designating May 15, 1998, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. 
This is the fifth year in a row that I have sponsored this resolution and I am proud to be joined this year by 62 of my Senate colleagues in honoring the brave men and women who serve this country as peace officers. 
Mr. President, tomorrow we will be adding the names of 159 officers to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Since the inception of this memorial, 14,662 peace officers names have been inscribed on the wall. I am also pleased to share with my Colleagues that tomorrow, at the State Police complex in Meridian, Idaho, the State will dedicate its own Law Enforcement Memorial to those Idahoans who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
These memorials, and others around the nation, serve as proof that the individuals who serve this nation as our guardians of peace do so at great personal risk. There are few communities in America that have not been touched by the senseless death of a peace officer by violent means. Last year, two communities in Idaho experienced the tragic deaths of two very talented and brave officers. I would like to share with you the sacrifices these men gave to protect the sanctity of their communities. It is my hope that while I relay their stories each of us would realize the important role that peace officers play in our everyday lives. 
While searching for the body of an 18 month old infant who had been lost in the Salmon River, William Inman, a Lemhi County deputy Sheriff, was killed when his hyper-light aircraft struck an unmarked power line and he tragically plunged into the river. 
Deputy Inman devoted his entire life to being an excellent police officer. He was a Sergeant in the police force in Peoria, Illinois, where he retired in order to become the Chief of Police in Farmington. After retiring from the Farmington force he moved to Salmon, Idaho, where he went to work as Sheriff's Deputy for Lemhi County. After his death deputy Inman was inducted posthumously into the American Police Hall of Fame. 
William Inman was a father of four children: Maria, Tracy, Jeff and Jennifer and was a loving husband to his wife Donna. Along with spending as much time with his family as he could, Bill was an avid outdoorsman. 
Bill Inman will be greatly missed by many, many people. 
The second tragedy struck Idaho's capital city of Boise in the early morning hours of September 20, 1997. Boise Police Officer Mark Stall pulled over a car bearing Pennsylvania plates that had committed a traffic violation. The driver and passenger of the vehicle refused to cooperate with Officer Stall's requests, when the driver suddenly removed a gun from under his coat and shot Officer Stall. Officer Stall, inflicted with a mortal gunshot wound, fell back to his patrol vehicle for cover and continued firing at the men in order to protect other Bosie officers in the ensuing gunfight. Both Officer Mark Stall and the two assailants were killed. Mark Stall's sacrifice protected not only the officers at the scene but the entire community, when a search of the suspect's residence revealed an arsenal of guns and explosive materials. You know it was not for peaceful purposes. 
Officer Stall was an exemplary police officer and set the standard for other officers both in Boise and around the nation. He was a loving father to his daughters Jonelle and Julia, and a devoted husband and best friend to his wife, Cheryl. Officer Stall was committed to his family, his community, his job and above all his God. I would like to share with you an excerpt from an Idaho Statesman article that outlines the lives of Idaho Peace Officers. In the article Officer Heath Compton characterized his hero, Mark Stall. `One night quite a while back, I was driving down State Street in my patrol car, when a Boise police officer shined his spotlight in my face. I stopped to talk with him. I had never met the officer before, but realized quickly that he was very likable. He introduced himself as Mark Stall. Over the next several months, I got to know Mark quite well. What I learned was that Mark loved God, his family, the people he worked for and with. He always had a smile on his face and a good word.' 
The bravery and commitment to community that these men possessed will be carried on by their families. I am pleased to say that I have had the opportunity to spend time with the families of both officers. 
I met with the Inman family this morning, and yesterday I met with the Stall family, with his wife and his daughters and also with his mother and father, with his mother-in-law and father-in-law, brothers and sisters and all of their children. What a beautiful family. The only thing that was missing was Mark. But you can see the blessing that Mark had given to that family because of the wonderful memories of a great man. He will be missed greatly by his community and by his family, but every life that Mark touched will be blessed because of his being here. 
The strength and perseverance that is exemplified by each of them is an inspiration to me. My thoughts and prayers go out to these families and others that have been devastated by this type of senseless loss. 
This resolution is not the answer to the meaningless violence that occurs in our communities but it is a small attempt to celebrate and memorialize the lives of the officers who serve and protect us. I would like to thank my colleagues for their cosponsorship and would like to again thank the officers and the families that have come from all fifty states to our Nation's capital on this special day to eulogize these officers that have given the greatest sacrifice of all--their lives--in the performance of their duties. 
Mr. President, I know I speak for all Senators and for Americans when I salute the peace officers of America in all the communities, large and small. When they perform their duties, they are not sure what the outcome will be. They are never sure if it is going to be a peaceful stop or one that ends in violence and the loss of life. 
I know many of the police officers throughout my State of Idaho. I am proud to know each and every one of them, and I pray for their safety and that the officers will return safely to their families. 
It is an honor to serve here, with all of the police officers on Capitol Hill who we come to know personally. Again, they are an outstanding group of peace officers, as they are throughout this Nation. 
Today, Mr. President, I thank the Senate for properly acknowledging the role of peace officers and saying to the Inman family and to the Stall family, thank you for your sacrifice. God bless you and may you have peace in the days that follow. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, no longer is there any doubt that Congress must audit the Internal Revenue Service. 
The hearings that have recently been held in the Senate Finance Committee have brought out under the glare of public scrutiny what many taxpayers already know from personal experience: the IRS needs reform. We have been made aware of incidents of flagrant, unbridled abuse of government authority which until now were known only to the victims of an agency that has expanded far beyond its intended size and scope and is clearly guilty of violating the public's trust. 
While these problems have been successfully highlighted by the Finance Committee, I would like to take just a moment to reiterate some of the more glaring examples of IRS abuse: 
Former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker was victimized by an IRS agent in Tennessee who, in an attempt to advance his own bureaucratic career, tried to frame Baker of money-laundering and bribery charges. After the agent was exposed, IRS authorities, rather than engaging in a reform effort to root out similar abuses in the future, tried to cover up for the rogue official. 
IRS agents, armed with automatic weapons and attack dogs, raided John Colaprete's business after a former bookkeeper, who had embezzled $40,000, leveled bizarre and unsubstantiated allegations. Again, the charges were completely unfounded and none were filed. 
Robert Gardner was subjected to a 33 month investigation that involved the IRS engaging in activities including the seizure of his office property, feeding lies to a grand jury, and attempts to compel Mr. Gardner's clients to wear hidden microphones. 
I know from personal experience the problems the IRS can pose for hardworking Americans. For an agency that the American people give a significant portion of their money over to, customer service is not a top priority. In February of 1996, for example, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Wiester of Orofino lost their home and outbuildings when Big Canyon Creek flooded. On their federal income tax return, they justly claimed a casualty loss, although their tax preparer put the loss on the wrong line of their 1040 form. The IRS then refigured their return and, instead of the $1,206 refund the Wiesters were due, the IRS claimed that they owed the government $15,885 in tax, interest, and penalties. Within five months, the IRS contacted Mr. and Mrs. Wiester saying that a levy was going to be placed on their property. After numerous fruitless calls to the IRS, the Wiesters contacted my office, and after I wrote the IRS six times, the Wiesters' problem was finally rectified, nearly ten months after the simple error on the 1040 form was made. 
This type of behavior is no longer acceptable. The Senate will shortly pass the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, which will fundamentally overhaul the agency and make comprehensive, meaningful steps toward reform. The bill: creates an IRS oversight board to oversee every aspect of IRS operations; holds IRS employees accountable for their actions by requiring the agency to terminate employees who violate rules; suspends interest and penalty payments when the IRS does not provide appropriate notice to taxpayers; shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in legal proceedings; makes it illegal for Executive Branch officials, such as the President, to audit people; creates new performance standards for IRS employees so that they are no longer ranked on collection goals; expands awards for attorney's fees and civil damages to taxpayers; expands attorney-client privilege to accountants; and requires a greater notification process for the IRS to place liens, levies, or seizures on taxpayers's property. 
I believe that this legislation is a meaningful step to reform the tax culture in Washington. Once the new majority took control of Congress in 1994, a three-step process has been implemented to fundamentally change the Washington tax culture: (1) Reduce the collection, (2) reform the collector, and (3) replace the complexity. I am proud to say that this Congress has passed the largest tax cut in American history as part of the first balanced budget in a generation. I have supported all of these measures, and will look forward to supporting legislation that will substantially `reform the collector' and provide the American people with a fair, just, and responsive IRS.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to declare my concern over the dumping of barley into the American market by a European producer. 
I share the Idaho barley producers' outrage about the current unprecedented movement of heavily subsidized European Union feed barley into the California feed markets. Last week, a 30,000 metric ton cargo of European feed barley was sold into the Stockton, California feed market. As expected, this sale has caused a tremendous ripple in American barley prices. In fact, this action has caused the price of barley to drop 34 cents a bushel after the subsidized European Union feed barley sale was announced. This sale undermines both the intent and spirit of trade agreements with Europe and contradicts the goals of trade fairness. 
Any time there is a drastic drop in the price of any commodity, America's agriculture community and leaders must take notice. Whether the dumping was intentional or not, we must not allow it to go unchallenged and the practice cannot be allowed to continue. American barley producers can compete with any in the world, but there must be a level playing field. The European Union must now take steps to level that field. 
I, along with my some of my colleagues, have met with European Union Ambassador Hugo Paeman about the problem. Ambassador Paeman has assured us that the European Union countries will not repeat the recent sale of subsidized barley into the United States. That would be a disaster for Idaho and American producers. The ambassador also assured us that this is in no way a precedent, and in fact is a unique and isolated event. However, if this sale is still allowed to go through, it could create a real concern that this deal will set a precedent. 
Barley is very important to the economy of my home state. Idaho produces 60 million bushels of barley a year, worth $155.3 million annually. We are the second largest barley producer in the U.S. and barley is the state's fifth largest crop. 
Mr. Chairman, I call for termination of this sale of European Union barley and also for assurances from the European Union that U.S. grain markets will not be disrupted by unfair trade practices. That is why I am submitting a resolution calling on the European Union to halt this shipment and for the administration to investigate this unfair practice.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to begin my discussion of this very important issue by commending the people of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for their brave and determined transition to democracy and free market economies. The citizens of these three nations have suffered grave injustices and brutal atrocities during World War II and the Cold War and now, to see these nations emerge from these dark days and turn toward democracy, deserves the praise of every man and woman who cherishes freedom. 
I also want to express my strong support for the security and independence of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. I also believe the United States and its military forces will support the independence of these nations whether or not they join NATO. 
While I want to encourage the move toward democracy, free markets and Western values in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, I also want to see these values take root in Russia. It is because of my concern that a vote now on NATO expansion will hinder our relations with Russia and risk the Duma's ratification of the START II Treaty that I will vote against NATO expansion at this time. 
I have spent a good deal of time and effort discussing the issue of NATO expansion with a number of U.S. foreign policy makers and military leaders. I have given this question a considerable amount of thought because I believe before the United States commits itself to defending additional nations, with U.S. nuclear weapons if necessary, we must carefully consider all of the ramifications of this action. 
As I look at the current security situation in Central Europe, I do not see a security threat that necessitates a vote to expand NATO today. What I do see however, is a weakened superpower in Russia with thousands of nuclear weapons that can reach the United States. 
I think if anyone looks at the lessons of the end of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles, it shows that the harsh terms of the peace imposed on Germany fed the antagonisms that allowed Adolf Hitler to come to power. That, I believe, is the real threat we face today. 
At present, we have an historic opportunity to bring Russia into the West and cement Russia's commitment to freedom, democracy and free enterprise. On the other hand, we can expand NATO, right up to Russia's border, and we can thereby inadvertently recreate a Russia that is a threat to U.S. security and peace in Central Europe. 
It is ironic that by adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO we may create the security danger these nation's fear. More importantly, by voting to expand NATO today I believe we run the risk of undercutting the supporters of democracy in Russia and fuel the fears of those who want to restore an aggressive, imperialist Russia that will then require billions of dollars in additional American taxpayer money to deter. 
This is not idle speculation, this scenario is real and it is here now. At present, the Russian Duma has refused to ratify the START II Treaty and this action has led the United States to maintain nuclear armed ICBMs, SLBMs and ballistic missile submarines that we would otherwise deactivate under the START II treaty. In fact, the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal would drop from about 6,000 warheads under START I to 3,000 under START II. Department of Defense figures indicate by fiscal year 2000 it will cost hundreds of million of dollars to keep the U.S. nuclear arsenal at a START I level. 
While we wait for the Russian Duma to ratify START II, the Secretary of Defense, our friend Bill Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, believe that we must keep our forces at a START I level to keep the pressure on the Russia Duma to ratify the treaty. 
Therefore, when the supporters of NATO expansion discuss the costs associated with adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the alliance, I would ask that they add the cost of keeping U.S. nuclear forces at a START I level to their calculations. Let the record show, no Administration official has stepped forward to argue that a Senate vote to expand NATO will encourage the Russian Duma to ratify START II. 
In fact, in a conversation I and several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee had with Alexie Arbatov, a member of the Russian Duma and a democratic reformist, Mr. Arbatov told us that NATO expansion undercuts democratic reformists ability to promote cooperation between NATO allies and Russia. He continued to tell us that expansion of NATO to include these three countries will delay Russian ratification of START II. 
The Washington Post recently included two articles describing the degraded state of Russia's nuclear arsenal. These articles also confirm the extensive testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee which documents Russia's growing reliance on nuclear weapons. 
As my colleagues, know, Russia's economic problems have resulted in a huge reduction in that nation's conventional capability. This reality has led Russian policy makers to enunciate a policy stressing a reliance on nuclear weapons to defend Russia's security interest. 
We therefore find ourselves in a situation, under the proposed NATO expansion, where we are extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella closer to Russia's border, and literally to Russia's border in the Kaliningrad province which borders Russia, at a time when Russia is increasing its reliance on weapons of mass destruction to defend its interests. 
Given Russia's growing reliance on nuclear weapons, I believe it is dangerous for the United States to push the border of NATO eastward to Russia's border at this time. 
Administration officials tell us NATO expansion is not directed toward Russia, indeed some offer the hope that Russia will eventually join NATO, but I ask these officials do the Poles, the Hungarians and the Czechs believe NATO is their defense against Russia? Of course they do! 
I also question the logic of those who say Russia is free to join NATO. If Russia is allowed to join NATO, what is the real mission of NATO? If Russia and everyone else who wants to is allowed to join NATO, is NATO still a self-defense alliance or is it then a new version of the United Nations? 
I believe NATO expansion at this time will decrease U.S. national security because I believe it will hinder joint U.S.-Russian efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. According to a February editorial in the New York Times by Howard Baker, Sam Nunn, Brent Scrowcroft and Alton Frye, `frictions over NATO distract Moscow and Washington from profound common dangers.' At the top of the list of the `profound common dangers' is the threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This enormous challenge begins with our effort to control the nuclear weapons, nuclear materials and nuclear scientists in Russia. All of these crucial non-proliferation programs require the active cooperation of Russia and a vote today to expand NATO does not contribute to this cooperation. 
As it stands today, even my good friends on the other side of this issue will agree Russia's conventional forces are weak and getting weaker. Russia's plans for new conventional weapons systems are slowed and reduced. Russia cannot afford to regularly pay the members of her armed forces. Instead, Russia has turned efforts inward to refocus and rebuild their country; and, with our help, Russia may reemerge with a strong market economy rooted in freedom and democracy. Without a doubt, Russia's continued evolution toward the West will have the greatest impact on long term U.S. security. 
Mr. President, I support efforts by the United States and the European Union to help Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to become strong democracies with robust market economies. But I also want Russia to continue on the road to freedom and democracy so I therefore will oppose the resolution to expand NATO at this time.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. This is a voluntary, incentive-based approach to help improve the academic excellence in our public schools. It allows each State, if they wish, to utilize Federal funds that they receive so they can reward excellence and encourage their schools. There is no new requirement of new Federal money. It uses existing Federal money. There is no new Federal bureaucracy put in place. It would be taken care of, again, voluntarily by the States. It is simply a concept that all of us believe in; that is, incentive and reward. We now give a new tool to our public schools to utilize these funds for that purpose, if the States so choose. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am here today to support the A+ Education Savings Accounts bill the Senate is currently considering. 
Many Americans, including single mothers and low and middle income families, face the dilemma of how to afford the best possible education for their children. The A+ bill is good legislation that gives all families education opportunities they may not have otherwise. 
During my years as a United States Senator, I have learned that the true measure of the legislation we propose and pass comes from my constituents in Idaho. A letter from a northern Idaho school teacher named Brad Patzer perfectly expresses why the Senate should pass this bill. The Patzer family has one child in 2nd grade and the other in kindergarten. I would like to share with you an excerpt of Mr. Patzer's sentiments regarding the educational future of his two children. Brad wrote, `. . . I believe that the power of choice needs to rest with parents and I agree that this IRA would provide more equal opportunities for those willing to make their children's education a priority.' 
The Patzers, like most parents, do not want their children's impending education costs to prevent them from receiving the highest quality education. They want flexibility to make good choices both about day to day K-12 educational expenses and the future enrollment of their children in college. This legislation accomplishes these goals. 
The A+ Education Savings plan will aid families and school districts all over the country. As we contemplate the rising costs of education many would believe those comments are solely directed to higher education. As we have learned in recent years, however, parents are having equal difficulty in paying for their kids elementary and secondary schooling. The A+ legislation begins by increasing the current contribution limit of $500 for educational IRA's to $2000. The scope of this IRA is also expanded to allow contributions to be used for day to day elementary and secondary education as well as future college costs. This provision allows parents to save for their future college expenses while at the same time covering expenses during their child's younger years. For example, if a family deposited an original $2,000 in an A+ account at the time of their child's birth, they would have a savings of $4,522 by the time the child reaches kindergarten. Another provision in this bill would establish a tax free status for state-sponsored prepaid tuition programs, allowing students to withdraw from an account, tax-free, that was established years before the student approached his or her college years. 
In addition, the A+ bill proposes a new, and creative method for constructing schools. The private sector would be allowed to use tax exempt financing to build schools, and would then be able to lease those facilities back to local school districts. After a designated number of years the facilities would then become the property of the leasing school district. In the bill's current form, Idaho is authorized to issue up to $10.2 million of these new type of bonds; $5 million for wherever the need is the greatest and another $5 million for high growth school districts. Under the bill, however, only a few school districts would be eligible to utilize this bond. I have raised, with the floor manager of the legislation, my concern that economically depressed school districts, not just high growth areas, should also receive special consideration. To be issued, however, these bonds must conform to conditions imposed by Idaho state and constitutional law. The floor manager of the bill, the senior Senator from Georgia, has said he is willing to work to see whether this issue can be addressed when this bill goes to conference with the House of Representatives. The measure retains current federal law that allows school districts, with voter approval, to issue an unlimited amount of tax-exempt bonds for school construction. 
As I mentioned earlier, the A+ bill allows for the establishment of a tax-free savings account for each American child. It also contains a special provision for the use of such accounts for children with special needs. Specifically, the bill waives the age limit for children benefiting from such accounts for those students with special needs. I feel this is an important acknowledgment of the financial concerns which can come with being the parent of such a child. We reauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act because we wanted to improve the way we educate special needs children. This provision will help parents expand on what we have already done. 
I would also like to thank my colleagues for their support of my Student Improvement Incentive Grant amendment. This amendment provides states with a new option for how to use their federal education dollars. Under my amendment, states will be able to use these funds to reward schools which demonstrate excellence. Such a system will help create competition between schools to encourage improvement in education. Most importantly, in creating this new option, we did not increase federal regulation, federal spending, or federal oversight of our schools. 
I support the pending legislation because it gives parents more financial tools to meet education needs. The bill creates educational savings accounts which allow parents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child in a designated savings account. These after-tax, non-government dollars would earn interest at a tax-free rate and could be used for education expenses (home computers, tutoring, tuition) associated with any K-12 school. With help of my amendment we have also established a precedence to raise the level of excellence within our schools. This legislation is not the sole answer to the future of America's education, however, it is a step in the right direction. I would urge my colleagues to recognize the significant role this educational savings plan could have in the future of many American students and their families. I would urge my colleagues to support and pass this legislation.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, the current discussion on education in the United States has been widespread. Both sides of the debate, I believe, truly have the best interests of our Nation's young people at heart. It has been a good discussion, and I commend the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for his leadership on this issue. 
We often differ on issues of school choice, Federal involvement in the classroom, and State flexibility. The amendment that I offer today addresses one of this Nation's educational needs while doing so in a manner which should not be controversial. This is the student improvement incentive grant program. 
The amendment I am offering today is quite simple in its nature. Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, States are given a level of flexibility with how to use some of those funds. My amendment provides yet another option for States. 
Under my amendment, States would be allowed to use some of their Federal education funds to provide awards to public high schools based on the schools' performances on statewide assessment tests, the content and substance of which would be entirely up to the State. 
There are several important elements to this proposal. First, this is not a new program but merely a new option from which States may choose. Second, the assessments would be based entirely on State priorities and desires. Third, no new funds are required. Thus, my proposal gives States a new way to create a healthy competition amongst public high schools without imposing new Federal requirements, additional Federal oversight, or increasing Federal spending. 
As my colleagues are well aware, approximately 2 months ago it was widely reported in the media that high school students in the United States scored well below their peers in an international exam in math and science. In fact, of the 21 nations involved, U.S. students ranked 19th. In comparison, however, U.S. fourth graders performed strongly against their international peers on similar exams. Somewhere along the way we are failing our students by not encouraging them to maintain the high standards that they have demonstrated early in their academic careers. 
My amendment will help change this trend by creating financial incentives to encourage greater academic performance in our secondary schools. At the same time, it achieves this goal while leaving the control over education where it belongs, in the State and local communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support the student improvement incentive grant amendment. 
I yield the floor, Madam President.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a patriot and a technical expert, George Guedel, who is retiring on May 1, 1998. George was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and was raised in the Seattle, WA area. 
George attended the U.S. Naval Academy for two years until the responsibilities of marriage led him to leave the academy. George completed his bachelor's degree in physics at the University of Washington. In 1965, George began working for the Navy in the underwater acoustics field, and, except for a short stint as a government contractor, continued working in that field for the Navy in positions of increasing responsibility until his retirement. 
George's assignments include: Head of the Carr Inlet Acoustic Range; Head of the Acoustic Analysis Branch at the Naval Undersea Warfare Station in Keyport, WA; Head of the Santa Cruz Island Acoustic Range Facility; and Head of the Submarine Noise Measurement & Analysis Branch of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bremerton, WA. Throughout his career, Mr. Guedel has been highly regarded for his expertise in underwater acoustics and machinery vibration, as well as for his skill in managing complex acoustic testing. 
George's final and longest assignment was as Director of the Naval Surface Warfare Center's Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD) in Bayview, ID for over ten years. In this important position, George oversaw a major expansion in facilities and staff in support of critical testing for the Seawolf and New Attack Submarine programs. 
His work at the ARD also included frequent presentations to top government officials and extensive involvement with the Idaho community. He has been recognized with an Employee-of-the-Year Award, several Special Act Awards and Special Achievement Awards, and numerous letters of recognition from high-ranking Navy officers. George Guedel is the author or co-author of numerous technical reports on ship and submarine noise characteristics. 
George and his wife Ruth have 5 adult children, one two-year-old granddaughter, and a golden retriever. George has been an accomplished sailor since childhood, regularly competing in regattas. He is also an avid scuba diver and outdoorsman. After retirement, George plans to volunteer his skills to an organization devoted to preservation of the environment. George also hopes to spend more time on his hobbies and to win the sailing Nationals. 
George Guedel has been a stalwart contributor to our Navy's stealth service and he has given outstanding assistance to me in my effort to showcase the impressive work performed at the Navy's premier submarine acoustic testing center in Bayview, Idaho. I want to wish George and Ruth good luck, fair winds and following seas in their next endeavors.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I want to acknowledge the great work that the Senator from Nevada has done on the Endangered Species Act, along with the Senator from Montana and the chairman from Rhode Island. 
This is not a question of whether we should sell excess BLM lands; it is taking place; it is a question of where the revenues should be utilized. 
The Budget Committee--and I thank the chairman--came up with a revenue source that finally we could compensate landowners who voluntarily stepped forward so we could have an incentive to help species and to help property owners. 
Now the effect of the second-degree is to say that rather than foreclose the use of that excess land revenue, we will continue to look at all different sources of revenue so that we can come up with ways that we can make good on our pledge, and that is, property owners should be compensated when they come forward and help us save species. 
This is good for species, good for people, and it keeps all options open.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Market Access Program. This program continues to be a vital and important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and expanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm income and protecting American jobs. 
The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success by any measure. Since the program was established, U.S. agricultural exports have doubled. In Fiscal Year 1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 billion and contributing billions of dollars more in increased economic activity and additional tax revenues. 
For example, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture received $125,000 of Market Access Program funds during the past year. These funds were used to promote Idaho and Western United States agricultural products in the international markets of China, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. One particular activity, the promotion of western U.S. onions in Central America, required $15,000 of MAP funds and generated inquiries for onions valued at $150,000. 
Demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing 4 times greater in international markets than domestic markets. MAP has been an enormously successful program by any measure in supporting this growth. Since the program began in 1985, U.S. agricultural exports have more than doubled--reaching a record of nearly $60 billion in 1996; contributing to a record agricultural trade surplus of $30 million; and providing jobs to over 1 million Americans. 
MAP is a key element in the 1996 Farm Bill, which gradually reduces direct income support over 7 years. Accordingly, farm income is now more dependent than ever on exports and maintaining access to foreign markets. 
Two years ago, European Union (EU) export subsidies amounted to approximately $10 billion in US dollars. The EU and other foreign competitors also spent nearly $500 million on market promotion. The EU spends more on wine promotion than the US spends for all its commodities combined. 
Mr. President, the Market Access Program should be fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition and protect American jobs.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
As we debate the issue of increasing the American share in reserve funds of the International Monetary Fund, I think we should first consider the following two questions: Would it make sense for U.S. companies and employees to pay taxes to bail out foreign competitors of American business? Should Americans pay taxes to bail out foreign countries that have engaged in unfair business practices that previously made it difficult for American companies to sell their goods at home and abroad? 
The resounding answer to these questions is no. These would, however, be the precise ramifications were Congress to approve IMF funding legislation that does not require all countries who receive IMF loans to engage in just and fair business practices that do not threaten the American companies whose very tax dollars make these IMF contributions possible. 
I would like to touch on the recent IMF loan to South 
Korea, which I believe is a compelling example for why the IMF must be reformed. 
By many accounts, South Korea's economic crisis stems in large part from the government's practice of extending favorable loans to industrial conglomerations to rapidly expand in export-oriented sectors. When world markets could not absorb the resulting excess production capacity in these industries, the prices for South Korea's major export products declined, which in turn threatened South Korea's ability to repay these loans. 
Such government-directed subsidization for expansion can be seen in the 350 percent debt-to-equity ratio of the three major South Korean semiconductor manufacturers, nearly 10 times the U.S. average. This practice of the government subsidizing rapid industrial expansion in overcrowded industrial sectors has threatened American industry. It has allowed South Korea to sell its products below market costs, jeopardizing American competitors, who operate in a free-market economic structure. 
South Korean dumping has been well documented and has resulted in several antidumping rulings against the country's semiconductor conglomerations. 
The results of these practices have been devastating for domestic semiconductor producers, including those in Idaho. Take, for example, Micron Technology, America's largest producer of dynamic random access memory computer chips headquartered in Idaho, which employs more than 10,000 people. From their perspective, a United States-backed IMF loan to South Korea that does not put an end to some of South Korea's unsound and unfair economic practices would mean they would pay taxes to bail out foreign competitors who have engaged in business practices designed to undermine the U.S. semiconductor industry generally, and Micron specifically. American Microsystems, Incorporated, also in Idaho, would suffer from IMF loans that could be used to support their foreign competitors. 
So as we consider this funding increase for the IMF, we have a unique opportunity to place some reforms on the IMF which would prevent loans such as the one granted to South Korea from threatening American businesses in the future. 
The supplemental appropriations bill that was passed by the Appropriations Committee requires the Secretary of the Treasury to certify that IMF borrowers have to end government lending and subsidies to businesses, as well as comply with all international trade obligations they have made. 
In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to certify that no IMF resources have resulted in supporting the borrower country's semiconductor, steel, automobile, or textile and apparel industries, and that both the IMF and the Treasury Department will strictly monitor these conditions. 
These are good steps toward ensuring that IMF money, which is backed largely by the American taxpayer, will not in the future be used to undermine the American businesses and workers who generate this revenue. 
Mr. President, that concludes my statement. I want to thank the Senators from Alaska and Kentucky and Nebraska for their leadership on this issue.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on March 27, 1998, Master Chief John Hagan passes on the duties of Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy after more than five years in this prestigious position. When Master Chief Hagan steps aside and hands responsibilities to Master Chief James L. Herdt, he ends the longest tenure of any Senior Enlisted Advisor to serve our great Navy. 
Through his tenure in office, Master Chief Hagan has traveled the globe listening to and answering the needs of Sailors. His extensive travels have included stops on every continent--from the northern reaches of Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland, to the ice capped McMurdo Station, Antarctica. He has shared Christmas day with Sailors deployed onboard ships in the Arabian Gulf and July 4th visiting Sailors at Naval Support Activity Naples, Italy. In every way, on every day, he has dedicated his life to serving Sailors, not only during his service as Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, but throughout more than 32 years of service since his initial enlistment in Asheville, North Carolina. 
Master Chief Hagan worked very hard to gain the support of Congress on a variety of issues on behalf of Sailors. Every Sailor serving today and every Sailor who serves in the future owes a debt of gratitude for the service of John Hagan. Master Chief Hagan garnered support for volunteer education issues making it possible for those serving at sea to complete college courses. His work ensured Sailors housing allowances better meets their actual needs to ensure safe, affordable housing. Master Chief Hagan worked closely with Congress to facilitate the revitalization of family housing and bachelor quarters throughout the Navy, and his work facilitated a greater understanding in Congress of the full spectrum of issues unique to Sailors. 
Master Chief Hagan participated in virtually every decision impacting the lives of enlisted Sailors over the last five and one-half years. He helped strengthen the core of Navy's Recruit Training at Naval Training Center Great Lakes, participated in the establishment of leadership training through the Navy's Leadership Continuum, building the quality of the Navy's Senior Enlisted Academy, improving the Navy Physical Fitness program, increasing the number of females serving onboard surface warships and so many more. 
Master Chief Hagan faced many challenges head on during his tenure. Not the least of which were concerns over the Navy's traditional Chief Petty Officer Initiation. Master Chief Hagan met this challenge head on by guiding this event away from any reasonable criticism into a season of events the Navy can point to with great pride. Today, CPO Initiation Season begins the day the list of those selected for promotion is announced and ends eight weeks later with the formal advancement ceremony. This season includes a series of team building exercises, social events, physical fitness training and efforts to link with Naval heritage. Master Chief Hagan will long be remembered within the Navy for producing the Naval Heritage/Core Values Reading Guide. This part of CPO Initiation Season requires the Navy's newly selected Chief Petty Officers to read a book of non-fiction, Naval heritage to facilitate a discussion of the Navy's Core Values of Honor, Courage and Commitment. This encourages Sailors to link with their heritage and better understand the qualities required of Sailors. 
Master Chief Hagan stepped forward in May 1996 to speak on behalf of all Sailors at the Memorial Service for Admiral Mike Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations. Hagan said of Admiral Boorda, `He was the leader we longed for and looked to; he came from among us and rose so high, always remembering the lonely, insecure, frightened recruit, which all of us are in the beginning, before we discover that the Navy is a family.' Those words were true of Mike Boorda and they are true of John Hagan. 
In March 1997 he spoke to the assembled brigade of midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy where he told the Navy's leaders of the next century `The very honor of our Navy and our nation has been repeatedly upheld by Sailors throughout our history.' Master Chief Hagan has not only upheld the very honor of our Navy and our nation, he has raised the stake to new heights. 
Today's Navy is the greatest Navy the world has ever known and this can be said in clear conscious because of the service of Master Chief John Hagan.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the government of Costa Rica which has failed to deal with the theft of property from American and Costa Rican landowners by squatters. At the same time, I call on the Government of Costa Rica to come to a quick and thorough conclusion in their investigation into the death of United States citizen Max Dalton of Idaho. 
Despite claims of the Costa Rican Government to the contrary, landowners, including United States and Costa Rican citizens, have reported harassment and invasions by squatters in all areas of the country. The squatters' tactics have included stealing and starving livestock, burning homes, leveling crops, death threats, machete attacks, and, in the case of one Idahoan, murder. 
The Washington Post reported in its March 2 edition that Max Dalton had been threatened by these squatters for nearly five years before his death in November. Before he was murdered, Max was harassed by squatters who attacked him with machetes, bombed his house, stole his horses, and set fire to his boat. Just days before his death, Max's children again notified authorities about the threats against their father. 
The United States embassy in Costa Rica had warned Costa Rican officials about threats on Max Dalton's life. Nonetheless, on November 13, 1997, this 78-year-old United States citizen and World War II veteran was surrounded and ultimately murdered by land squatters, some of whom were illegally occupying his property in the Pavones region of Costa Rica. This crime was the tragic conclusion to a 5-year assault perpetrated against Mr. Dalton by the squatters in an attempt to steal his property. 
Many facts remain unanswered surrounding Max Dalton's death. The investigation into the murder remains stalled and the killers remain at large. This cannot be tolerated. The murder of Max Dalton must be investigated and I urge the Costa Rican Government to make sure this happens. 
I call on the Costa Rican Government to take immediate and decisive action to clarify and protect lives and property rights. Law-abiding citizens and residents should not be threatened by acts of intimidation, violence and property theft by bands of squatters who have been terrorizing legitimate landowners through all regions of the country. Max Dalton's death must not be in vain. 
That is why, Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution, along with 13 of my colleagues, condemning the incompetence surrounding the investigation into the death of Max Dalton. It is important that this body, the United States Senate, acknowledge this situation and let the Government of Costa Rica know that reform is required. 
Mr. President, I submit this resolution on behalf of myself, Senator Helms, Senator Faircloth, Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Hutchison of Texas, Senator Craig, Senator DeWine, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, Senator Chafee, Senator Leahy, Senator Coverdell, and Senator Warner. 
It is time for use to send a very clear message to Costa Rica, that we ask them for a thorough investigation, that we call upon them for the reform so that the landowners--the citizens in Costa Rica and the U.S. citizens that are there--can know that there are laws that will be adhered to and that justice will be done.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President. I rise today to address the issue of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program in the Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). This DBE program is a narrowly tailored program that establishes the goal for states to have prime contractors use DBE's to do some portion of their federally assisted construction projects. While the federal goal is 10% of all projects, states are free to develop their own goal for their level of participation. 
There is much confusion about what the ISTEA DBE program is and what it is not. It is not a program of federally mandated quotas that requires states to participate with the threat of financial sanctions for noncompliance. It is however, a program that allows states to set their own goals and targeted levels participation and permits annual renegotiation of these goals. Additionally, states are permitted to waive their self established goals in a particular contract or for an entire year if compliance is not possible. In fact in both 1996 and 1997 two states did not meet their goals and no sanctions were imposed. 
Mr. President, the national goal for participation is 10% and while each state can vary from this my state of Idaho has adopted 10% as their target. The Idaho Department of Transportation informs me that this program is very popular, it is easy to administer and participation is high. In fact, the state of Idaho has exceeded their 10% goal every year including the last three where participation was 11%, 12.4% and 10.7%. In Idaho the majority of the recipients of these construction contracts have been women owned businesses. Interestingly enough since the inclusion of women owned business as an eligible class under the ISTEA DBE program in 1987 women owned business in my state have increased 104%. While this growth figure includes all types of businesses, I am confident that the positive impact of this program on the construction trades cannot be over emphasized. 
Mr. President, put quite simply the ISTEA Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program works. Without federal threats and financial sanctions this program has encouraged states to set goals that provide increased opportunities for women and minority owned businesses to participate in the ISTEA program. This is an excellent example of an incentive-based program that benefits our nation as a whole. I am committed to retaining this important program during the reauthorization of ISTEA.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the airbag issue. Before I describe this amendment, I want to commend and thank Senator McCain, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for all of his tremendous help and leadership and assistance on this issue of airbag safety, as well as Senator Bryan of Nevada who has had a keen interest in this for a number of years also. I appreciate the comments Senator McCain made a few moments ago about my involvement in this issue of airbag safety. 
This amendment does a variety of things, but one of the things that is very important is that it affirms that airbags are to be supplemental restraint systems, which is stamped on all the cars, `SRS,' supplemental restraint systems. They are not the primary restraint system, which is your seatbelt. I think whatever source you may look to, you will find that the seatbelt is the safest device that you can use in your car. 
With the airbags that have been placed in cars, we now see on the new cars it points out that this airbag may kill children. The tragedy is that, in fact, it has killed children. The numbers that just came out have indicated that 54 kids now have been killed by airbags, 36 drivers have been killed by airbags and four adult passengers, for a total of 94 individuals who have been killed by these airbags. 
I am one who believes that airbags certainly can be a good safety device when they are designed to standards that place them in their intended role as supplemental safety devices. This allows us now, and I will not go into the details because Senator McCain has laid that out very well, but this now allows us to go through with the Secretary of Transportation the rulemaking and the testing. It allows us to have a testing of these airbags for all sizes of adults. It is going to allow us to now have safer bags that will save lives so that we will not see these costly tragic numbers that I have just recited, and it will protect occupants of all sizes. 
I do believe that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, has had the authority to go forward with this. Their repeated conclusion is that they did not. 
Mr. President, recognizing that Senator McCain is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over issues related to traffic safety, is he aware that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says current law does not allow airbags to be regulated as supplemental restraint systems, and specifically that NHTSA does not have the legal authority to repeal the so called unbelted test standard? 
As the Senator knows, the American Law Division of the Library of Congress has reviewed this issue and has concluded that NHTSA has ample legal authority to repeal the unbelted test. The view of the Library of Congress is supported by a number of other legal experts as well.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it the Senator's view that this amendment is consistent with the statutory interpretation that airbags are supplemental restraint systems, not primary restraint systems, and should be regulated in such a fashion and do you agree that airbags do not substitute for lap and shoulder belts and that all occupants should always wear safety belts regardless of whether there is an inflatable restraint in the vehicle?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Does the Senator agree that the pending amendment affirms the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation to improve the occupant safety of all occupants provided by Federal Motor Vehicle Standard No. 208 while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants from injuries and death caused by airbags and, in order to accomplish the rule making required by this amendment, the Secretary shall include tests with dummies of different sizes representing the full range of occupants from infants to adults? The amendment only allows the Secretary of Transportation to reimpose the current safety standard after giving full advance notice to Congress, after giving the public time and opportunity to comment and then only if he or she concludes that doing so would protect infants and children, as well as other occupants, from death and injury. This amendment does not change the policy that airbags are still a supplemental, not a primary restraint system.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, without going back and reciting all of the past history, this is an amendment that, through a collaborative process, will now bring us to the point of safer air bags. 
A little girl who was killed in Boise, ID, was the reason for my involvement in this whole issue. So I hope that the family will find some consolation, some peace, in knowing that the loss of that precious little child will now lead us to a new era of safer air bags so that other families will not have to experience the tragedy that they have.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I rise with regard to the issue of the military construction veto override. I rise in support of overriding the President's veto of the military construction budget. 
Mr. President, I am one of those who supported the concept of the line-item veto. I still do. But when I voted for that, I certainly did not abdicate my rights and authority, if I disagreed with a Presidential line-item veto, to come back and speak against that veto and cast my vote. If, in fact, two-thirds of the Members of this body, along with two-thirds of the Members of the House, vote to override, it would be successful. 
Here is an example of two projects that were in the military construction budget which the President vetoed. Both projects were intended to support the combat requirements of the 366th Composite Wing based at Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
A recent letter to me from Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen described the critical role played by the 366th Composite Wing: `As one of the first units to deploy to a problem area, it has the responsibility to neutralize enemy forces. It must maintain peak readiness to respond rapidly and effectively to diverse situations and conflicts.' 
In an ironic twist of fate, the 366th was doing its mission on deployment in the Persian Gulf when the President took inaccurate information, provided by the Air Force, and vetoed two projects intended to support the combat effectiveness of this unit. 
President Clinton used his line-item veto pen to delete $9.2 million for an avionics facility for the B-1 bombers and $3.7 million for squadron operations facility for an F-15 squadron. 
In his veto statement, the President claimed the vetoed construction projects could not be started in fiscal year 1998 because there was no design work on the proposed projects. This assertion has now been proven false by a letter from the Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre, which now acknowledges that the Department of Defense provided inaccurate data about the status of design work. 
With respect to the two projects at Mountain Home Air Force Base, the outdated Air Force data provided to the White House listed both projects at zero percent design when in fact, as now verified by Air Force, both projects are in fact over 35 percent designed. Moreover, before any of these projects could be included in the FY 1998 Defense Authorization bill, the services were required to certify that each of the projects could be initiated in FY 1998 and that is what they did, without exception. 
As my colleagues know, the Department of Defense puts together a future years defense plan which projects the DOD budget six years into the future. Regarding the two projects at Mountain Home, I note that the Avionics Facility is contained in the Air Force's 1999 budget and the F-15 Squadron Operations Facility is contained in the service's 2000 budget. 
As the President ponders the use of the line item veto, I think there needs to be a dialogue with the legislative branch. If there had been dialogue, we might have been able to point out the faulty data being used by the White House. 
Early this year Congress and the President reached an historic agreement to balance the budget and increase defense spending above the President's request. Congress went through its normal deliberative process and we used the additional defense dollars to move forward funding for projects on the service's unfunded requirements lists. Indeed, the B-1 Avionics Facility was one of the top ten unfunded military construction projects identified by the Air Force. In addition, the funds were within the budget caps agreed to by the Congress and the President. 
President Clinton has made a mistake regarding his use of the line item veto authority on the military construction appropriations bill. The Office of Management and Budget and the Deputy Secretary of Defense acknowledged the President used outdated and inaccurate data to make his decisions. The Senate should give the President another opportunity to do the right thing and pass the pending disapproval legislation. 
Let me thank the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the Ranking Member, Senator Byrd for their quick and decisive action to bring this important legislation to the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, the point is that we have a line-item veto by the President of the United States based upon inaccurate information provided by the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force has come forward and they have provided the documentation and the letters, and it is to help the military of the United States, such as the 366th Composite Wing, which is one of the groups that will respond upon a moment's notice. I think that we have seen in the last 2 weeks the critical nature of this world and how we may call upon the men and women in uniform to go into harm's way on behalf of the United States of America. And here we are somehow considering that we will not override a Presidential veto that was based upon inaccurate information. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's line-item veto and to support the men and women in uniform. If there is any time in recent history that we see how critical it is to support our men and women in uniform, it is now, as we still have this buildup in the gulf and we still don't know what the resolution there will be to this international thug named Saddam Hussein, who still doesn't know and doesn't get the message. So, again, let's support our troops and override the Presidential line-item veto.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the National Character Counts week resolutions submitted by my esteemed colleague, Senator Domenici. I have cosponsored similar resolutions for the past 4 years and am honored to have the opportunity to do so again this year. 
I stand before you today, because children and adults alike are constantly being bombarded by violence, profanity, and immorality, both through the media and in every day life. This onslaught of negative images and expressions has expanded the issue of character from a casual concern to a matter of considerable social importance. During my tenure in the Senate it has been my goal, and the goal of many of my colleagues, to raise awareness of the importance of raising our younger generations in an atmosphere of strong principles. I can think of few things we could do to better achieve this goal than to bring the attributes of good character to a level that will be admired by our children. If, through our own actions, we demonstrate the value, and indeed the necessity, of good character, we may help turn future generations away from the all too often glamorized visions of unscrupulous activities. 
As a father, I am concerned that the role models our nation's children seek for leadership and guidance do not exemplify the integrity and character that most parents would condone. As an elected leader, I believe it is my job, and the obligation of my colleagues, to take an initial step to reinvigorate the attributes of character--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and fairness, caring, civic virtue, and citizenship--which National Character Counts Week highlights. We need to regain these qualities in our communities, in our families, and in the development of our own lives. 
Mr. President, as we watch our children blossom into the leaders of the future it is my hope that each and every one of them will be able to look up to individuals who epitomize the values and attributes that are represented by National Character Counts Week. I am proud to stand with my fellow colleagues today, to discuss the importance of having genuine character. The simple step of raising awareness of the value of good character can have a powerful and long lasting impact. In the words of President Ronald Reagan, `They say the world has become far too complex for simple answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally right.' 
Mr. President, I believe by standing before you today, the supporters of National Character Counts Week are taking the initial step in accomplishing what is morally right. We are, however, only a single piece in the puzzle. My colleagues and I, along with civic organizations around the Nation, are only emissaries of a message. The true fundamental values that will instill character in our children must begin at home. No amount of moral instruction from outside the home can replace the guidance of a loving and supportive family. 
Recognizing a national week to stress the importance of character is but a small step in addressing the crisis of ethics the Nation faces. At the same time, it is an important step which I believe all of us should support. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his continued leadership on National Character Counts Week, and urge my colleagues to cosponsor the resolution.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate an American athlete who has shown us all that adversity can be turned into inspiration and success. 
Picabo Street, a young woman from the tiny mining town of Triumph in my home state of Idaho, has thrilled us all with her gold medal-winning performance in the women's super giant slalom at the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
Four years ago I stood in this chamber to offer my congratulations to Picabo, who won a silver medal in the Lillehammer Olympics in the downhill. While a lot has happened in this country and the world over those four years, one thing has remained the same: Picabo Street's desire to win an Olympic gold medal. 
That dream looked like it might not be fulfilled after a horrible accident 14 months ago during a training run. Picabo blew out her knee, and missed almost the entire 1997 season. But thanks to her determination and tireless rehabilitation, the knee was strong enough to return to action late last year. And then, another setback marred her prospects for Nagano. Just 12 days ago, she was knocked unconscious in a spill during a race in Sweden. 
But this remarkable third-generation Idahoan, who learned to ski on the slopes of Sun Valley, was determined not to let this latest setback keep her from fulfilling the promise she made to her parents when she was a little girl--the promise of Olympic gold. 
Picabo says the long and difficult months of rehabilitation from her injury were the toughest times of her life. Yet her hard work and dedication pulled her through. Even while she could only sit and watch her teammates get ready for these games, she never lost hope. 
Picabo's mother, Dee, taught her the words to the Star Spangled Banner. Four years ago, Picabo stood on the silver medal platform, listening to another country's anthem being played. She vowed the next time she'd hear her anthem. Those singing lessons came in handy today. With the gold medal around her neck, Picabo sang the words to our national anthem. I'm sure every American sang with her. 
Idaho can be truly proud of a hometown hero, who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to regain the form that made her a world champion. I ask every Idahoan and every American to join me in offering congratulations to this amazing athlete. 
The little girl from the gold mining town of Triumph, Idaho has triumphed and won the gold medal.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S.J. Res. 40, a resolution to propose a Constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag of the United States. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution. 
The people of Idaho have told me, quite clearly, that they feel we must take steps to protect the Stars and Stripes. By way of a resolution passed by the Idaho State Legislature approximately three years ago, my constituents let it be known that Idahoans want the opportunity to ratify an amendment to the Constitution which would prohibit the desecration of the flag. The resolution stated, `. . .the American Flag to this day is a most honorable and worthy banner of a nation which is thankful for its strengths and committed to curing its faults, and a nation which remains the destination of millions of immigrants attracted by the universal power of the American ideal. . .'. 
Perhaps nowhere is the desire to protect the American ideal exhibited better than in the men and women who serve this nation in our armed forces. As a member of the Armed Services committee, I have had the opportunity to visit with many of these outstanding Americans who serve our nation both on our own soil and in foreign lands around the globe. These men and women stand ready, at a moments notice, to put their lives on the line so that U.S. citizens here and abroad may live in peace and safety. They are prepared to protect, at any cost, the rights and freedoms which we all hold so dear, and for which so many have sacrificed so much during the more than 220 years of our nation's history. As they serve, even on foreign ground, they serve under Old Glory, the symbol of all that we value and cherish about the United States of America. The flag serves as a constant reminder of the land they call home, of their family and friends, and of all the values that make the United States of America the beacon of liberty and justice throughout the world. 
In trying to define what the flag of the United States means, I was particularly moved by the words of Henry Ward Beecher. In his essay, `The Meaning of Our Flag,' he wrote, `Our Flag carries American ideas, American history and American feelings. Beginning with the Colonies, and coming down to our time, in its sacred heraldry, in its glorious insignia, it has gathered and stored chiefly this supreme idea: divine right of liberty in man. . . .That it meant, that it means, and, by the blessing of God, that it shall mean to the end of time!' 
Mr. President, by supporting S.J.Res. 40, we honor the meaning of the flag. By acknowledging that the flag of the United States is more than just a piece of cloth, more than just a physical entity devoid of value, we indicate our understanding of those things for which it stands. I hope my colleagues will join me, and the resolution's sponsors and cosponsors, in taking the first step toward protecting the flag and everything it represents.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to commend six industrial sites in my State that have received recognition by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Programs, known also as VPP. 
The VPP is a cooperative organization between government and industry that was established in 1982 to emphasize and encourage safety, health, and environmental programs among labor, management, and government. This is done by recognizing certain industrial sites that have either achieved, or are making significant strides toward, excellence in worker safety and health protection. Mr. President, I am proud to say that six sites in Idaho have been recognized by the VPP. 
The following sites, all in Soda Springs, IA, have been awarded highest recognition as star sites: the Agrium Conda Phosphate Operations; the J.R. Simplot Company's Conda Pump Station; the Kerr-McGee Corporation's Vanadium Facility; and Solutia, Inc. 
In addition to these star sites, I would like to commend two additional industrial sites in Idaho, both run by Potlatch Corp., that have achieved recognition as Merit Sites: Jaype Plywood, in Pierce, ID; and Potlatch Corp.'s Consumer Products Division, in Lewiston. Mr. President, both of these Potlatch sites have employees who are represented by unions. Jaype Plywood workers belong to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local WO358, and Potlatch's Consumer Products Division employees are represented by the United Paperworkers International Union, Locals 608 and 712, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 73. I would like to say, in regard to these Potlatch sites being recognized by the VPP, that the cooperation that has been exhibited between organized labor and management represents, in my mind, the best way to achieve a truly productive working environment by avoiding division and intrusive government regulation that frequently is counterproductive to the best interests of both the laborers and management. 
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate all of these industrial sites in Idaho for their efforts. VPP recognizes the cooperation of labor and management, working in conjunction with the government, to create a safe and healthy work environment for all who work at the sites. This spirit of cooperation has clearly achieved results, and as a U.S. Senator from Idaho, I would like to say again that I am very proud of the six sites in my State that have been recognized by the VPP.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
First, Mr. President, I commend the leadership that Senator Thurmond has provided as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. With his steady hand on the wheel, we have brought forward a bill that I think all of us can be proud of. 
I also want to commend the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Levin. I believe this is the first year that he has been the ranking member. 
But that bipartisan spirit, that really has been the tradition of the Armed Services Committee, again is exemplified by these two Senators. I commend both of them for their leadership. You have served this Nation well and national security because of that partnership. 
Mr. President, I have the great honor of serving as the chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee. I say `honor' because I feel that that is the committee that deals with the men and women who so proudly wear the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Services. 
I cannot think of a more appropriate and patriotic partner than Senator Cleland of Georgia as the ranking member of that subcommittee. Our men and women know that when Senator Cleland is involved in any of these issues, their interests are looked out for. I thank him for his partnership but also for his friendship as well. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization conference report. I want to congratulate again all of the members of the committee who worked so diligently on this. The conference report now before the Senate authorizes an increase, for example, in a variety of areas. 
So what I would like to do, Mr. President, is just have a colloquy with my ranking member of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Cleland, and address a few of these issues that are included in the defense authorization bill. I add that these are issues that if, for some reason, we would lose the defense authorization bill, if it did not have sufficient votes or if upon passage it were vetoed, we would lose these items. So I think it is extremely important for us to underscore this. 
I would like to start with an area that Senator Cleland and I have held a hearing on, and that deals with the Aviation Officer Retention Bonus Program. This is something that is critical. 
So I ask the ranking member to explain what important step we took with regard to the aviation officer retention bonus.

Again, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, there is a tremendous investment in having the finest pilots in the world, pilots that have been trained to defend this Nation. But many of them--too many of them--are now leaving the Armed Services and they are going into the private sector. We need to have this sort of a program so that we can retain the best pilots in the world in which we have made millions of dollars of investment. 
The pending bill also authorizes a 2.8-percent pay increase for our men and women in uniform. Again, I ask my friend from Georgia to explain the importance of this particular increase.

And referencing back to what the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, has talked about, the deployment of our troops currently around the world, the deployment in Bosnia, the dilemma that we are currently facing with Iraq, the news that continues to come out of North Korea that because of the famine, we do not know what is going to happen in North Korea. 
So we have our troops deployed around the world, ready to put their lives on the line. Here we have a situation that, again, if for some reason we lose this bill, we are not giving them the full pay increase that they are entitled to. The message that that sends to our men and women in uniform is not healthy. 
Mr. President, the bill also authorizes reductions in end strength, or manpower, reductions consistent with the Quadrennial Defense Review, to allow the services to save funds for badly needed modernization. 
I ask Senator Cleland, Is it true that if this bill is not enacted into law, the services will be forced to increase current personnel levels to meet the floors established in last year's defense authorization bill?

I want to commend the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for his leadership on this issue as well. 
During our hearings this year the subcommittee heard testimony from actual recruiters about some of the difficult quality of life issues that they face.

Senator Cleland and I had a hearing on this aspect of recruitment. We are facing problems with recruitment. Here we are talking about the actual recruiters. We need to deal with this aspect so those recruiters have a quality of life they can truly sell to those new individuals as to why they should join the services. 
The defense authorization bill also includes seven provisions addressing the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs activities with regard to assisting those suffering from Persian Gulf illness. I note, too, Mr. President, that Senator Cleland is a former head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing this spring in which General Schwarzkopf testified. At that particular hearing I asked General Schwarzkopf his thoughts as to what is the cause of Persian Gulf illness, and his point was he did not know what the cause of Persian Gulf illness was nor did he know the extent, but he made the very important point we have to deal with our veterans that have this. 
The committee remains dedicated to ensuring that the Department of Defense, in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs, continue an aggressive research effort to determine causes and treatment for this debilitating illness.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Georgia, and I agree totally with the comments about our dedication to this. 
Mr. President, the bill also includes a very important provision to correct a mistake made over 50 years ago. Specifically, the bill authorizes retroactive payment of the stipends for Congressional Medal of Honor winners who only this year received the award for heroism during World War II. Specifically, the bill authorizes payment to Vernon J. Baker and the surviving families of Edward A. Carter and Charles L. Thomas. 
Because of racism, seven Americans were denied the Medal of Honor they rightly earned over 50 years ago. Earlier this year in a very moving ceremony at the White House, President Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to Vernon Baker and the next of kin of the other recipients, except for one recipient who, because he died so young, had no surviving relative. The conference report helps right this wrong. It ought to be adopted by the Senate and signed by the President of the United States. 
Mr. President, I am proud that Vernon Baker, a quiet and dignified man, is a resident of the peaceful community of St. Maries in my State of Idaho. Vernon Baker has never asked for the retroactive payment of the stipend for the Congressional Medal of Honor, nor has he ever sought my assistance. But believe me, his act of bravery in April 1945 makes him more than worthy and he deserves to have this wrong corrected. We are not suddenly providing him or the families of the other recipients with a windfall. Instead, we are simply making sure that they receive what should have been provided some 50 years ago. 
There are other numerous important quality of life provisions in the pending conference report, including military construction projects which include family housing. You can recruit the soldier, but if you are going to retain him you have to take care of the family. That is what this addresses. It cannot be initiated without passage of this report. 
I would like to thank my friend, Senator Cleland, for helping to explain some of the important provisions in the pending conference report and also for the many hours of dedicated service he and the other members of this subcommittee put in to make sure that we are taking care of our men and women who wear the uniform of the greatest Nation in the world. 
My final point, Mr. President, is simply that, again, if for some reason this bill does not become law, all of these quality of life issues that we have addressed are lost. That is a terrible message to send to the men and women who are defending the freedom of this Nation around the world on behalf of the United States. 
I yield to my colleague, Senator Cleland, for any additional comments he would like to make.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the chairman also knows the pending conference report authorizes $220 million for technology development work in fiscal year 1998. Within these authorized and appropriated funds, Assistant Secretary Alm has agreed to provide $22.5 million to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory [INEEL] to enhance application and deployment of innovative technologies across the DOE complex through specific validation, verification, and system engineering activities. This work will focus on simulation modeling, treatability studies and development of disposition processes for major DOE waste streams. The work will also help focus DOE's Environmental Management Program on accelerating clean up, developing alternative, improved technologies, and developing and tracking performance metrics for these efforts. This work is certainly within the authorized scope of work of the DOE's Technology Development Program, is it not?

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I take the floor today with some sadness, but also with a great deal of gratitude. I rise today to mark the retirement and celebrate the career of one of our Nation's great leaders in science, my constituent and my friend, Dr. Charles Till. 
At the end of this year, Dr. Till will conclude more than three decades of outstanding accomplishment at Argonne National Laboratory. For the past 13 years, Chuck has served as associate laboratory director over engineering research. Dr. Till's leadership, his vision, and his good humor will be sorely missed. 
Chuck Till sprang from humble beginnings, with little early indication of the opportunities and demands that lie ahead. He grew up on a farm in rural Saskatchewan, and by his own admission, and his father's observation, showed no outstanding aptitude for technical and mechanical things. This would change. 
Chuck entered the University of Saskatchewan, where he earned a bachelors degree in engineering physics and a masters degree in physics. He then attended the University of London, where he earned his doctorate in nuclear engineering. Apparently, somewhere along the way, this small town farm boy developed an aptitude for technical matters. 
Dr. Till's first job out of college found him in the unlikely, but not surprising, position of being in charge. He was hired by the Canadian General Electric Co., as reactor physicist and given responsibility for the start of the first prototype heavy water reactor in Canada--no small task for a first professional job. And of course, Chuck excelled. 
In 1963, Dr. Till joined Argonne National Laboratory as a reactor physicist. His rise in this great organization is best traced by his accomplishments rather than the positions he has held. 
Early on in his career, Chuck got the attention of scientists worldwide with a breakthrough advancement in fast reactor measurement techniques. The Doppler Effect was known to be crucially important, but its measurement was uncertain. Dr. Till completely revamped the heated sample Doppler technique, and an order-of-magnitude improvement in the measurement resulted. The technique became the standard worldwide, and essentially has not changed to this day. 
Dr. Till soon became responsible for all fast reactor work at Argonne, and continued to emerge as a leader in his field. Chuck wrote several important works examining technical issues of nuclear physics and engineering. Dr. Till has also served on several advisory committees and evaluation boards, and testified numerous times before congressional committees. Notably, Chuck served as technical director and a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, and was largely responsible for the United States retaining its leadership role in fast-reactor technology. 
But his greatest contribution, to both his discipline and to the world, lies in the development of the Integral Fast Reactor, the IFR. This inspired source of electrical power has the capability to achieve incredible efficiency in fuel use, while significantly lessening problems associated with reactor safety and nuclear water. In 1986, the IFR showed that it can protect itself from overheating and meltdown. It does so through the natural physical properties of the materials used rather than by relying on operator intervention or an engineered safety system. The IFR was also designed to burn most of its own waste, as well as that of other reactors and the material from dismantled weapons. Unfortunately, this program was canceled just 2 short years before the proof of concept. I assure my colleagues someday our Nation will regret and reverse this shortsighted decision. But complete or not, the concept and the work done to prove it remain genius and a great contribution to the world. 
Through his work on the Integral Fast Reactor program, Dr. Till demonstrated that his technical solutions out paced the ability of the political process to appreciate them. Dr. Till also demonstrated that technical leaders can take scientific material and present them in a manner understandable by citizens and Members of Congress. This skill is what makes Chuck Till such a valuable asset to me in my duties as a Member of the U.S. Senate. 
I am pleased and gratified that my work in the Senate has allowed me to get to know Chuck Till and his lovely wife Kay. I cannot question that this is the best decision for them, but Chuck's talents will be missed at Argonne National Lab. 
Perhaps the greatest legacy that one can leave is knowing your ideas and work are important enough to be carried on when one departs. We will do that with Chuck Till. 
I want to wish Chuck and Kay the very best in retirement and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say thank you for your unmatched contributions and service.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I rise today in support of S. 1292, a bill to disapproved of President's Clinton decision to veto over 30 military construction projects. 
I will add, Mr. President, I am a proponent of the line-item veto. I believe the line-item veto can be an effective tool to eliminate wasteful spending but I believe the fact that the White House now admits it used faulty data when it decided to veto a number of military construction projects demonstrates that this important authority must be used wisely and carefully. 
I would like to speak for a moment about the two military construction projects the President vetoed in the State of Idaho. Both projects were intended to support the combat requirements of the 366th Composite Wing based at Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
A recent letter to me from Secretary of Defense Cohen described the critical role played by the 366th Composite Wing: `As one of the first units to deploy to a problem area, it has the responsibility to neutralize enemy forces. It must maintain peak readiness to respond rapidly and effectively to diverse situations and conflicts.' 
In an ironic twist of fate, the 366th was doing its mission on deployment in the Persian Gulf when the President took inaccurate information, provided by the Air Force, and vetoed two projects intended to support the combat effectiveness of this unit. 
President Clinton used his line-item veto pen to delete $9.2 million for an avionics facility for the B-1 bombers and $3.7 million for a squadron operations facility for an F-15 squadron. 
In his veto statement, the President claimed the vetoed construction projects could not be started in fiscal year 1998 because there was no design work on the proposed projects. This assertion has now been proven false by a letter from the Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Hamre, which now acknowledges that the DOD provided inaccurate data about the status of design work. 
With respect to the two projects at Mountain Home Air Force Base, the outdated Air Force data provided to the White House listed both projects at zero percent design when in fact, as now verified by Air Force, both projects are in fact over 35 percent designed. Moreover, before any of these projects could be included in the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill, the services were required to certify that each of the projects could be initiated in fiscal year 1998 and that is what they did, without exception. 
As my colleagues know, the Department of Defense puts together a future years defense plan which projects the DOD budget 6 years into the future. Regarding the two projects at Mountain Home, I note that the avionics facility is contained in the Air Force's 1999 budget and the F-15 squadron operations facility is contained in the service's 2000 budget. 
As the President ponders the use of the line-item veto, I think there needs to be dialog with the legislative branch. If there had been dialog, we might have been able to point out the faulty data being used by the White House that was provided by the U.S. Air Force. 
Early this year Congress and the President reached an historic agreement to balance the budget and increase defense spending above the President's request. Congress went through its normal deliberative process and we used the additional defense dollars to move forward funding for projects on the service's unfunded requirements lists. Indeed, the B-1 avionics facility was one of the top 10 unfunded military construction projects identified by the Air Force. In addition, the funds were within the budget caps agreed to by the Congress and the President. 
Let me read a document, prepared by the 366th Wing, which explains why we need the B-1 avionics facility. This was written by the civil engineer at the base avionics facility: 
Current facility is inefficient, aging, wooden building misconfigured for avionics functions. Numerous false alarms in the fire suppression systems cause excessive avionics support equipment down-time and often cause damage to test equipment. This facility supports over $1 billion of avionics equipment for the wing's fighter aircraft with $115 million in testing equipment. Current avionics facility is approximately one-half the size required for all the wing's aircraft and has severe operational problems supporting fighter aircraft of this wing. About 33,000 sq. ft. of the existing 54,000 sq. ft. facility is condemned for personnel usage. B-1 avionics is currently being maintained at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota due to inadequate facilities at this base. Engineering estimates by the Army Corps of Engineers found the current facility is uneconomical to renovate. Construction of a new facility collocating avionics for the B-1 and fighter aircraft is the most economical solution and finalizes the B-1 beddown program. 
The Office of Management and Budget and the Deputy Secretary of Defense acknowledge the President used outdated and inaccurate data to make his decisions. The Senate should give the President another opportunity to do the right thing and pass the pending disapproval legislation. 
Let me thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd for their quick and decisive action to bring this important legislation to the Senate floor. I urge my colleagues to support the pending legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is just for a question. 
Would the Senator from Montana agree with me that as we are provided the data, although the idea was that these projects were not necessary, were not needed, yet we find they are in the President's own budget for the very next year or the year following that? And, since we have all of this data and we have established, through written information from the Air Force, the inaccuracy of the data that they provided the White House, the President and the White House should not find themselves in a situation where they feel they have drawn a line in the sand and there is no way they can back away from this; that it is best for the Nation and our national defense for the White House to acknowledge that, based on inaccurate data, we all should review this and come to a different conclusion, and that is to allow these projects to go forward?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this morning in support of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. This legislation is another step in our continuing effort to give the Nation's senior citizens something they have lacked for far too long--real choice in health care. 
I believe we are fortunate that a provision added to this year's Balanced Budget Act has served to focus our attention on a very important and basic freedom. I'm talking about the freedom of individuals, regardless of age, to choose how they are going to spend their health care dollars. When the Senate first debated this issue, I wholeheartedly supported the idea of `private contracting' for two reasons. First, I heard from numerous Idahoans who feel they are losing their choice of doctors because of Medicare's overly bureaucratic method of operation. As more and more health care providers refuse to accept Medicare, senior citizens are finding they no longer have access to the providers they wish to see. Allowing private contracting will provide seniors the chance to maintain the patient-provider relationships which are so important to them. 
Second, I support S. 1194 for an even more fundamental reason. I do not believe a nation, for which so many have sacrificed so much in the name of freedom, should tell senior citizens that they do not have the freedom to provide for themselves, even if they are perfectly able to do so. Many of our senior citizens are people who worked, and fought, during some of this century's most difficult times, yet current Medicare rules tell them we don't think they are capable of determining, for themselves, how to best meet their own health care needs. Mr. President, this implies that government bureaucrats don't feel those who survived the Great Depression and World War II, and helped make this Nation what it is today, are capable of understanding and meeting their own needs. What a ridiculous concept. 
Would we tell food stamp recipients that they could not use their own money to buy food, even if they worked hard to gather the financial resources needed to feed themselves? Would we tell someone in subsidized housing that they may not use their own resources to move into a home which they could call their own? The answer to both these question is, of course, no. In fact, I would be willing to guess that anyone suggesting such an idea would be laughed right out of this Chamber. Yet, there are those who don't believe senior citizens should be allowed to provide, voluntarily, for their own health care needs. 
Mr. President, the bill we are discussing this morning simply says that if you have the ability to take care of your own health care needs, and you wish to do so, you should be legally allowed to do so. Supporting it should simply be a matter of common sense. 
I have heard from numerous Idahoans who tell me they want the freedom to decide whether or not to use Medicare to pay for health care services. I have heard from numerous health care providers in my State who sincerely want their patients to have that choice. I trust the senior citizens of Idaho. I believe they are more than capable of making a decision about how to pay for health care services, and should be given the option to make that choice for themselves. 
The American people are intelligent. If you give them choices, they are certainly able to decide which option is in their best interest. During my tenure in the Senate, I have consistently worked to give Americans more choice, while reducing government intrusion in their lives. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act accomplishes both of these goals, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, my children attend a high school in Fairfax County. It is a high school that has great diversity, great hope, great potential. It is a school that you might say is in some transition. The school has seen a great deal of improvement, has a great deal of camaraderie, a great spirit at this public high school. It is Mount Vernon High School. The teachers care, the parents care, the administrators care. My kids have made terrific friends at this school, friends that indeed will last a lifetime. 
One student, Ann Harris, became one of my daughter's absolute best friends. They had morning period together. They had one book that they would share, they would make notes and they would pass it each day with the thoughts that they had in their heart and they would share it back and forth. 
Ann Harris's father, Coleman, has been PTA president for 3 years. His wife, Jean, you could not ask for a better booster for that high school. They want to make sure that that high school is a safe place for kids, and they have done a terrific job. 
March 29 of this year my wife and I were driving when the 
cell phone rang. I answered, and it was my daughter. I could tell that something was very wrong because of the anguish in her voice. She said, `Dad, when will you and Mom be home?' And I said we will be home very soon. Then my daughter started crying and she said, `Ann Harris is dead.' And I said, `What?' And she said, `Ann is dead,' and she continued to cry. I tried to ask her what in the world had happened, and she said she has been shot. 
We later learned that she had been shot in a drive-by. So here is Coleman and Jean Harris, doing all they can as parents, all that teachers and administrators can do to make sure that you have a safe school, a safe environment, and a safe neighborhood. 
But here is the irony. That shooting did not take place in our neighborhood. It took place 3,000 miles away over spring break because of something going on in that community where some guy, for whatever reason, got offended and fired into the back of that automobile, ending the lovely life of a 17-year-old girl. 
Ann Harris was a model student and a model citizen. She was an A student. She was an outstanding athlete, a great tennis player. She had been accepted to Purdue University. She is gone because somebody--somebody--just undertook a senseless and pointless act that extinguished the life of so much potential. 
I can tell you that not just my daughter cried but a whole community has cried in mourning the loss of Ann Harris. I don't think there is a sweeter smile that I have seen on anybody than on the face of Ann Harris. 
We talk about this today on the floor of the U.S. Senate because how many times throughout the United States in any of our communities do we pick up newspapers and find out that a young life has been extinguished because of some senseless, violent act? We read about it all the time. 
In 1994, more than 2,600 juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 were murdered. That is a rate of seven per day. One in five of these victims was killed by another juvenile. The number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has increased 60 percent in the last 10 years. During that same time, murder arrests rose 125 percent. Our young people are the most frequent victims of violent crime. They are raped, robbed or assaulted at a rate five times higher than adults. The homicide rate for youths in the United States is 10 times higher than in Canada, 15 times higher than in Australia, 28 times higher than in France and Germany. This increase in juvenile crime has been linked to the increase in youth gang activity. Gangs are now present in all 50 States, in large cities, small cities, and in rural communities. 
I think it is appropriate for the U.S. Senate to salute the life of Ann Harris and all of these young Americans that we have lost who have been senselessly killed for no reason. 
At graduation this past June, they still called Ann's name, and her brother and sisters came across the stage to accept her diploma. Waiting on stage to meet each graduate were Coleman and Jean Harris. They hugged every student, just as they hoped that they would be hugging Ann on receiving her diploma. 
May this tragic event somehow cause all of us to look around our own communities. With us today are Coleman and Jean Harris; Ann's high school principal, Calanthia Tucker; Fairfax County school board member, Kris Amundson; members of the church, the pastor. 
All of us today salute and celebrate the life of Ann Harris and the life of the young people that aren't with us. Let us, as parents and as adults, redouble our efforts. What have we done lately for our children and for our community? Have we gotten involved in our children's schools to make sure they are safe, that they are drug free? Have we demonstrated with organizations like Parents and Youth Against Drug Abuse that that is the right thing to be doing? Have you worked with local law enforcement agencies to develop safer neighborhoods and a support system? 
Ann's parents have continued their efforts to promote safer schools in safer neighborhoods. They have started with what is called Ann's Campaign, `Ann's Campaign For A Safer America.' The focus of the campaign is to help youth and adults live the kind of life exemplified by Ann, a life that radiated kindness, warmth and compassion for others. That describes Ann Harris. 
In just a few months, Ann's Campaign has grown from a simple concept born of love to a national organization with a web site that offers encouragement, support, and information to interested persons. Ann's Campaign provides links to other support groups such as Mothers Against Violence in America and Students Against Violence Everywhere. Through this type of networking, the Harris's hope to promote a positive message to young people that together we really can build a better America and a safer America. 
I send my sincere thoughts and prayers to the Harris family on their loss, my admiration and support for their effort to make our world a little bit better place to live. As the model of Ann's Campaign advocates, we need to encourage each other to smile more, to care more, to love more, and to be more understanding. If we save just one life, we have paid the finest tribute in the world to Ann Harris, and we can do so. This senseless loss of life of our young people must come to an end. 
So while my heart is sad, it also celebrates. My family knew Ann Harris. All the kids at Mount Vernon High School knew Ann Harris, and for the rest of their lives they will know the joy that she brought to them, and through Ann's Campaign it can bring to others throughout the United States. 
Mr. President, I referenced Ann's Campaign and the fact that they have a Web site. Anybody who wishes to access that, if they simply access `annscampaign.org,' they would have access to that Web site. I acknowledge that Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia, whose alma mater is Mount Vernon High School, intends to be speaking on this issue today, too, as well as Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, who will be coming down and speaking on this issue. 
I mentioned about the parents and all of us getting involved. I am very proud of my wife, who is now the President of the PTA of Mount Vernon High School. Now, it is with pleasure that I turn to my colleague from Idaho, the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, who has comments with regard to Ann Harris.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. At 11 a.m., under the previous order, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote on the modified committee amendment to Senate bill 1173, the ISTEA reauthorization bill. Following that vote, the Senate will vote on passage of House Joint Resolution 97, the continuing resolution. Therefore, Members can anticipate two consecutive rollcall votes beginning at approximately 11 a.m. today. If cloture is not invoked at 11:00 a.m., a second cloture vote is expected to occur later in the afternoon. Hopefully, the Senate can make good progress on the highway legislation during today's session. 
As a reminder to all Members, a third cloture motion was filed last evening in the event that cloture is not invoked during today's session. If needed, that vote will occur on Friday at a time to be determined later. In addition, if any appropriations conference reports become available, the Senate is expected to consider those reports in short order. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, integrity. That one word encompasses the life of Joe Cenarrusa. Today, family, friends, and the people of Idaho bid farewell to a man filled with integrity whose life ended tragically on September 9, 1997. 
Joe Cenarrusa, the son of Idaho Secretary of State Pete Cenarrusa and his wife Freda, was first and foremost a family man. But he was also a successful businessman who was very active in his community. 
Joe Cenarrusa was born on the family ranch in Carey, ID. He was Pete and Freda Cenarrusa's only son. Joe had a love for flying--a love which he inherited from his father who was a Marine fighter pilot during World War II. At the age of 4, Joe would sit on his father's lap in the cockpit and Pete would let him take over the controls. It was clear from that early age that Joe would continue to soar to new heights. 
The day he turned 16, Joe took his first solo flight. He then took his FAA check rides for the instrument, commercial, and airline transport ratings on the days he became age-eligible for them. Joe graduated from the University of Idaho where he was a flight instructor and was also active in the skydiving club. 
In 1974, he returned home to take over the ranch. He brought with him new ideas and innovative techniques which turned the operation into one of the most successful livestock operations in Idaho. 
Joe Cenarrusa never shied away from a challenge. `You just can't take; you also have to give.' That's how Joe lived his life, always finding ways to give back to his community--especially for causes that helped children. 
Joe felt every child needed a bicycle. A young child riding a bike was only natural, but there were some children in the community whose families couldn't afford bikes. So Joe decided to do something about that. As the owner of Red Robin Restaurants, Joe would offer deluxe hamburgers for anyone who would donate a bicycle. Those bikes would be refurbished by a friend, Mike Cooley, and then donated to needy children at the start of each school year. `Burgers For Bicycles' was a program that made Joe happy. It made his friend Mike Cooley happy. And it made thousands of schoolchildren happy each fall. 
Joe also had a place in his heart for battered and neglected children who ended up at the Hays Shelter Home. He'd bring the children and staff from the home down to his restaurant once a week and let them order whatever they wanted off the menu--including dessert. What a wonderful opportunity and a very visible sign to these neglected children that someone in their community cared. 
Joe is remembered as a `good, decent man, a visionary, a man of integrity, a man who loved his family, and a man who, in the best tradition of America, gave generously to his community.' He never lost sight of his Basque values. He understood the value of hard work, and he learned at an early age the importance of honor and integrity. 
The measure of this man is reflected in the mission statement for his company which reads, `We are a company committed to creating opportunities for success.' Joe Cenarrusa's life was committed to helping all around him succeed. And for that, each of us who knew Joe have lived a richer life. My prayers are with his parents Pete and Freda, his wife Jean, and their two sons, Andy and Tyler.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Nothing is more important than ensuring all of our citizens have safe and affordable supply of drinking water. Over the last 6 years, both agencies have been very helpful. The Indian Health Service has provided technical assistance and funding to characterize the groundwater contamination and to investigate alternatives. Its efforts have included the drilling and testing of wells, conducting Tribal meetings, providing educational material, and assisting in Federal coordination. In addition, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe, Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, and others have devoted an enormous effort over several years to assess the situation and develop alternative solutions.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, has it become politically incorrect to cut a tree, or even to walk in the woods? I don't think we want to go down that path. But then, if this amendment passes, we may not have a path to go down at all. My State of Idaho is 63 percent Federal land, and the majority of that is Forest Service. Not surprisingly, timber is a major industry in the State, and outdoor recreation is growing. Both depend on access to these Federal lands. 
Mr. President, 97 percent of the roads on Federal forest land are open for recreational use. That includes camping, hiking, hunting, fishing--activities which a recent study by the administration found make up three-fourths of all the use of Federal land. Take away the roads and you take away the public's ability to access their Federal lands, and the economic diversity that recreation provides to rural western communities. 
Besides recreation, those roads provide access for environmental management--to, among other things, monitor wildlife, and bring wildlife under control. Without the budget to construct or reconstruct these roads, managers will lose vital access. There is also the danger that these roads will become unstable, and pose an environmental threat to watersheds. 
Do we have too many roads on Federal land? That is a good question--how many is too many? Compared to other road systems, the Forest Service does not even come close, with a mile and a half of road per square mile, compared to 8 miles per square mile on private timber land. 
This is the crux of the point: there are many demands placed on Federal forest land, only one of which is to provide the solitude that true wilderness offers. No one will dispute the importance of wilderness, and that is why so many States have passed wilderness bills. 
We have designated wilderness for a reason--so that some areas meet the public's expectation of a solitude experience, and allow the rest of Federal timber land to serve the public's other needs: to provide timber to build our homes, and to allow for other types of recreation that include access on some type of vehicle. 
My State of Idaho is already home to the largest continuous wilderness area in the continental U.S: the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. 
The administration's own study of the Interior Columbia Basin found that the majority of Americans using Federal land in the Pacific Northwest like to be able to access it using a car or some other type of vehicle. My colleagues, we need a safe, accessible road system. 
This amendment would undermine that goal. And because it would also increase the cost of timber activities, and decrease revenue to rural counties, the amendment would pull the rug out from struggling, resource dependent communities. These rural communities are the base for the values that we hold dear--where the work ethic is taught as a part of daily life to kids who learn to respect the world around them. We can't afford to force these communities into oblivion, because we will lose what is best about ourselves. 
These cuts will hurt the very people we are working for back here. I am talking about the small business owner, the laborer and even the firefighter. Groups such as the International Association of Fire Fighters, the Pulp & Paper Workers Resource Council, the United Paper Workers International Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners of America, and many others have all come out against this amendment. 
The Forest Service designed the purchaser credit program to be an off-budget means to provide the access Americans expect. It does so at a significant savings to the taxpayer when compared to how much it would cost to use appropriated funds. In return for providing a public service, the bidder on timber contracts receives a credit applied to that or another sale. 
Seventy-five percent of these bidders are small businesses. I fail to see a subsidy for big business--what I see is the Forest Service finding a way to do its job and save taxpayer dollars, an advantage for small companies, and jobs in small communities. Is this what we want to eliminate? 
I urge colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is not about wise management of our Federal lands--it is about making those lands available for only one use, and that is unacceptable.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative [AHRI] was first announced by President Clinton in his State of the Union address to provide federal support to communities undertaking river restoration projects through improved access to federal resources and by encouraging private sector support for local efforts. 
An interagency team led by the Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ] was established. The CEQ formally announced the program in the May 19, 1997, Federal Register. The Federal Register announcement stated that the goal of the AHRI was to address a `need for concerted, long-term efforts in water quality improvement, river restoration, and economic revitalization within and along the river.' Under the proposed rule, any person or community may nominate a river or entire watershed for designation by the Administration. 
I, like many of my Colleagues, have concerns about this initiative. For one thing, those who could be affected by such a proposal have not had sufficient time or opportunity to comment. Second, Members of Congress have not received a detailed briefing from the administration on how this plan is to be carried out. It appears that the administration has completely circumvented the affected public and Congress in an effort to implement the AHRI. 
I have concerns about where the funding and staff necessary to run this program will come from. In a time where budgets are constrained and the Federal Government is required to do more with less, it is difficult to support increased funding for a proposal initiated by the administration and where Congress has been left out of the implementation strategy. 
A while back I co-signed a letter to the administration outlining our concerns with this proposal, and to request an extension of the public comment period for an additional 120 days which was granted, and expired on August 20. I signed a second letter from the Idaho delegation to Ms. Katy McGinty, CEQ Chair.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, Idahoans are quite opposed to the AHRI. They see it as a further encroachment of the Federal Government not only into their lives but onto their lands. Even though the administration insists the initiative would be locally driven and administered, the average Idahoan strongly disagrees with this notion and simply wants the Federal Government's role to decrease in every possible aspect. 
Mr. President, I support the amendment to H.R. 2107 submitted by the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, in Lewiston, ID, as chairman of the Drinking Water Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee, I held a hearing to review the current Endangered Species Act and to identify ways to improve the act. It was clear from the testimony we heard that the current law simply is not working. It isn't working for species and it isn't working for people. That message was loud and clear. Senator Chafee was there with us at that meeting. 
We must do a better job of protecting species without jeopardizing our communities. The legislation that I am introducing today with Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Reid will do just that. It will bring real and fundamental reform to the Endangered Species Act, and it will minimize the social and economic impact of the ESA on the lives of ordinary citizens, and it will benefit species. That is the critical point. 
I want to thank Senators Chafee, Baucus, and Reid, who have worked diligently with me as we have crafted this legislation, which brings about balance and a bipartisan approach to a very sensitive issue. 
There are over 1,000 species on the endangered species list today but fewer than half of them have ever had a recovery plan written for them. The best evidence that the current law isn't working may be the fact that not a single species has recovered as a result of a recovery plan. It is as if you have a recovery room filled with patients and one by one these patients are brought in, given an examination by the doctor, and at the conclusion of the examination the doctor says, `Yes, you are critical. Next.' `What do you mean, next, doctor? What is the prescription? What is the recovery for this critical condition?" 
The emphasis has not been on recovery. It has been on continuing to list, list, list, without the emphasis on recovery. 
But the law must also have balance. It must recognize the rights of people, too. 
During our hearings, we heard many compelling stories from people who have had to live with the real life impact of the Endangered Species Act. We heard from families in Owyhee County, ID, who cannot get bank loans for their homes because the listing of a tiny snail--the Bruneau Hot Springs snail--has caused their property value to plummet. 
We heard from a woman in Laramie, WY, who told us that the mosquito control program in their community had been suspended because of the ESA, causing severe health risks for the citizens of Laramie, including her son who contracted encephalitis from a mosquito. 
We heard from a rancher in Joseph, OR, who described how Federal regulators, under the threat of lawsuit from environmentalists, tried to stop all grazing on forest lands up in the mountains because salmon were spawning in streams that ran through the private land below, but in his words, `The cows were up in the high country as far from the spawning habitat as you could get.' 
And we heard from mill workers who lost their jobs when the ESA all but shut down logging in certain national forests. I think that Ray Brady from Grangeville, ID, may have captured best the underlying feeling of frustration and anxieties:  
We had a choice of moving, of going someplace else. Why should we? I chose to live in a small community like Grangeville. I chose to work there. I worked there for 28 years and somebody else in a different part of the country makes a decision that has cost me my job and occupation and 28 years worth of experience. Now I am having to start all over again. I don't have any income. I don't have any insurance for my family or myself; and I attribute it directly to this Endangered Species Act. Somebody has to do something about it. I mean, not in the future, I mean now. 
Ray Brady is right. We need to improve the way that the ESA works, and we need to do it right now. We need an ESA that will make advocates out of adversaries. As it's administered today, it separates people from their environment. It invites Federal regulators to become land use managers over some of the best stewards of our environment--our farmers and our ranchers and our landowners. And we need their help if we are truly going to save species. Just remember, well over half of our endangered species depend on private property. 
The ESA must provide more incentives to encourage property owners to become partners in the conservation of a rare and unique species. 
The bill we are introducing today will achieve those goals. It will make the law work better. It will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy; 
it will enhance the recovery of species; and it will treat property owners fairly. 
Let me highlight just a few of the significant improvements that we have included in this legislation. 
The bill will put new emphasis on the need to use good science in everything from the listing process through recovery. The Secretary will be required to use the best available science in all of his decisions and to give greater preference to information that is empirical and peer reviewed. In addition, all listing and delisting decisions will be subject to independent peer review. That means that we can all have greater confidence in the decisions made under the ESA. 
The bill will add teeth to the recovery planning process so that we're no longer just running an endangered species emergency room without also providing the prescription for recovery. For the first time, we will set deadlines for the development of recovery plans for every listed species. Each recovery plan will be developed by a recovery team that includes scientists, economists, and representatives of the communities that are affected by the listing of the species. And we establish new substantive requirements for each recovery plan, including recovery measures, benchmarks to measure progress, and a biological recovery goal that will trigger delisting when it is met. We'll know that the law is working well when species are no longer just being listed, but when they're also being delisted as a result of a successful recovery plan. 
The bill recognizes that we can reduce bureaucracy and unnecessary Federal interference with land management decisions without harming species. In the consultation process, for example, the fact is that people spend too much time trying to comply with too many regulations from too many Federal agencies. That cannot only significantly increase the cost of a project, in some cases, it can be deadly. 
In 1996, in Yuba County, CA, for example, the Corps of Engineers was prevented from repairing levees south of the city of Marysville because of the impact that the repairs might have on the hibernating garter snake. The work wasn't done and on January 2, a levee failed in Olivehurst, CA, killing three people and flooding 500 homes. 
Under our bill, the Federal action agency, in that case the Corps of Engineers, will have the authority to make the initial determination that its repairs would not be likely to adversely affect the species. The levee repair could then proceed, unless the Fish and Wildlife Service objected to the initial determination within 60 days. This simple procedural fix will allow projects to be completed on time without jeopardizing endangered species. 
Perhaps most important, the bill includes a number of incentives for property owners so that they can become partners in saving species. 
The key is maximum flexibility and our bill provides that. For example, if you're an individual who wants to clear a few acres of land to build your vacation home in red cockaded woodpecker territory, our new low effect conservation plan may be just what you need. On the other hand, a county planning its development needs for the next 50 years might choose to enter into a multiple species conservation plan to preserve habitat for all of its rare and unique species. State and local governments can even enter into conservation plans to protect unlisted species. 
All of the conservation plans are backed by a no-surprises provision that gives landowners certainty that their obligations will be defined by the plan. They won't be required to pay additional money for conservation measures or to further restrict their activities on the land covered by the plan. 
In addition to conservation plans, the bill offers landowners the option of entering into separate agreements to manage land for the benefit of species. A small timber company whose lands are suitable habitat for spotted owls might enter into a safe harbor agreement to let the trees grow to attract the owls with the understanding that at the end of some agreed-upon period of time, it can harvest the trees. And a farmer might agree to set aside buffer strips for a species in return for compensation under a habitat reserve agreement. 
Finally, the bill limits the ability of the Federal Government and environmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on private lands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental groups have used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and development on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for drinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the activity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change that, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental group, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually harm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not just assumptions or speculation. 
When we started this process just over 2 years ago, we asked ourselves the question: Should we make a concerted effort to save species? The answer was yes. 
But could we do it without putting people and communities at risk? 
Today, I think that we've demonstrated that we can. We can save species with less bureaucracy, using good science, incentives, and where necessary, public financial resources. 
Charles Mann and Christopher Plummer wrote in their book `Noah's Choice,' `If we truly want to improve the lot of endangered species, we should stop shooting for the stars, because the arrows will fall back to our feet. By aiming a little closer, we might shoot farther in the desired direction.' 
And I will add, and hit the target more often. This bill hits the target. 
I would like to use my prerogative to just thank my staff for their efforts on this--Buzz Fawcett, Ann Klee, Jim Tate, and other members of my staff. I know the other Senators feel as I do about my staff, that they do a tremendous job. As we stand here with results of 18 months of hard effort, we know of the many hours they have contributed as well in making this a success. 
Mr. President, we now have a bill that is bipartisan. We have a bill that is scheduled for a hearing 1 week from today and for markup in committee where amendments will be considered 2 weeks from today. It is our full expectation that we will be able to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate for debate and for a vote sometime near the middle of October. It has been many months, if not years, in the making, to create this legislation which improves the Endangered Species Act, so that we can, again, save species and do it without putting people and communities at risk.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today which is intended to provide private property owners additional tools in their dealings with the Endangered Species Act. For both those who wish to participate in the conservation of land for the preservation of endangered, threatened, and other species and those whose participation is involuntary, this legislation will add to the already substantial means provided to property owners in the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1997. 
For too long the Federal Government has used its enforcement procedures and it regulatory authority to dictate conservation in aid of endangered and threatened species. This method has failed to produce the kind of results we want. The Endangered Species Act as currently written is almost all stick and no carrot. I would like to begin to change that today. 
For 18 months I have negotiated a bill to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act with the Democrats and the administration. Those negotiations have been successfully completed. We have introduced a bill that will provide a variety of incentives to property owners to preserve habitat through conservation agreements and plans, prelisting agreements and other preservation tools. I also have a number of ideas on how to provide tax incentives to private property owners to preserve habitat. 
Let me emphasize that inclusion of these new tax incentives will truly benefit both species and people. I have met with many property owners who have said, `we would be happy to step forward and preserve habitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there was an incentive.' Well with adoption of the ideas included in this bill there will be. 
I have had critics that have said that we should not provide these kinds of incentives to private property owners because we will have too many people coming forward and saying, `I have an endangered species on my land.' What is wrong with that? To my mind, that would be a welcome reversal from the current prevailing attitude that some have about the presence of an endangered species on their property. Right now you have a situation that some land owners believe that if they do have an endangered species, or if it's suggested that they might, they're just as likely to try to remove the habitat to avoid a problem down the road. We need to change that attitude if we're going to recover endangered species. 
We are currently at the crossroads of two systems. One where you have Government overregulation that tells people what they can and cannot do on their land, and the other a system that encourages property owners to step forward and do something good for species because it's good for them too. 
We can depend on our property owners to do what's right and what is good for species. I know that our farmers and ranchers know how to be innovative and creative. They know how to help species. And they know how to manage land. 
The right system is one where we encourage active involvement of landowners through incentives. Certainly, I know that if I were an endangered species, I would much rather have a friendly and willing landlord--one that viewed me as an asset--than a reluctant one who viewed me as a threat and a liability because of some bureaucrats and regulations handed down from Washington, DC. 
That is what this legislation will do. It is going to make the people active partners. 
The legislation I am introducing also includes a provision designed to safeguard the property rights of individuals. The Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1997 will do much to improve and enhance the rights of property owners. The bill limits the ability of the Federal Government and environmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on private lands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental groups have used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and development on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for drinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the activity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change that, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental group, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually harm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not just assumptions or speculation. 
ESRA '97 will protect the rights of property owners by making them a part of the process--a process that has excluded them for years. Now citizens, business people and State and local government representatives will be at the table for the development of recovery plans. Furthermore, the recovery plans developed will analyze the cost on the public and private sectors and the impact on jobs and property values for any recovery plan selected. 
Under ERSA '97 we will substantially reduce the number of consultations under section 7 of the act. But if a consultation is necessary under the act, property owners will have both a seat at the table and the information they need to meaningfully participate in the consultation. 
Throughout ERSA '97 we have kept our bond with the property owners of Idaho and America. But there is always more that should be done. 
The Endangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains strong property rights language. That language was developed in conjunction with some of the best minds in the property rights movement. Private property rights is a cornerstone of our democracy. As such it is incumbent on this Congress to address the issue in this Congress. The Endangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains my contribution to the effort.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recommend to the Senate passage of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act with a Kempthorne-Graham amendment. The passage of this bill represents a victory for many who are concerned with the hundreds of wildlife refuges across the United States and the multiple uses that they support. 
The bill, which was negotiated between Chairman Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, is another example of how positive change for the benefit of our environment can be achieved when we make a sincere effort to work together to reach consensus. 
The original House bill, H.R. 1420, came to the Senate after an overwhelming vote in the House. The bill was referred, in the normal course, to my subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works Committee. Now, there are some who wanted me to just let the House bill go without further review in the Senate. But if I have learned anything from Senator Byrd over the years, I have learned that I would be ignoring the responsibility and indeed constitutional duty of the Senate if I simply signed off on such important legislation without considering it carefully. 
The time that we spent to review the House bill was well worth it. We discovered an internal ambiguity in the bill which could have been taken advantage of by those who might want to eliminate many legitimate uses of wildlife refuges. My concern was that the bill's exclusive focus on so-called wildlife-dependent activities might be interpreted down the road as a signal that Congress intended only for these kinds of activities to qualify as potentially compatible activities on Federal wildlife refuges and that the many other uses of refuges that can now be authorized if they are compatible with the purposes of a refuge would be left out. 
That would indeed be a significant problem. Under the law now, our national wildlife refuges support many uses, including wildlife-dependent uses such as hunting and fishing, but also important nonwildlife-dependent uses, like grazing, oil and gas production, electricity transmission, and even family picnics and weddings. 
Under the House bill, any one of these activities arguably could have been eliminated on Federal refuges simply because they are not wildlife-dependent activities. 
In my home State of Idaho, for example, ranchers who were once promised that they would retain the right to graze their cattle on the Gray's Lake Refuge might have lost that right because an individual refuge manager, already hostile to grazing, interpreted the House language to preclude grazing as a compatible use. This is an important issue for my State because grazing occurs in four of the six Idaho refuges. 
On the Mississippi Sandhill Crane Refuge, grazing could have been curtailed even though the refuge manager there recognizes the value of grazing to improve the habitat for the crane. 
This amendment will ensure that livestock grazing can continue to be considered to be a compatible use on a wildlife refuge. 
But this amendment was not intended to address only grazing. Other legitimate and compatible uses on wildlife refuges could have been affected. Important activities associated with oil and gas development and the transmission of electricity to our homes and businesses could have been curtailed and even eliminated. From the 300 oil and gas wells at the Upper Ouachita Wildlife Refuge to the three wells in the Kirtland Warbler Management Area, all could have been shut down if this ambiguity had been exploited. With my amendment, all of these activities will be allowed to continue, provided that they are compatible with the purposes of the refuge.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I do not believe it was the intention of the parties who negotiated this agreement to eliminate nonrecreational uses on wildlife refuges. But I do believe that we have eliminated a potential legal argument for any who might try to use the ambiguity to curtail nonwildlife-dependent uses on refuges. 
As amended, I will support this bill. For the first time, it will establish hunting and fishing as priority uses of wildlife refuges and will ensure that other legitimate and compatible uses can continue in the future. Of particular interest and importance to me, to Idaho, and to other Western States, is the provision in the bill that provides, `Nothing in this act shall create a reserved water right, express or implied, in the United States for any purpose.' I strongly support this provision now, as I have in the past. 
I urge the adoption of the bill and the Kempthorne-Graham amendment.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding naval officer, Comdr. Sean Fogarty, who has served with distinction for the past 24 years in naval service. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy, and our great Nation. 
A native of Idaho Falls, ID, and a 1977 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Commander Fogarty comes from a patriotic family who has contributed immeasurably to our Nation's defense. His father was a career submariner and also a U.S. Naval Academy graduate. 
Commander Fogarty's service at sea includes a division officer tour aboard U.S.S. Harold E. Holt FF-1074, department head tours as Operations Officer aboard U.S.S. John Young DD-973 and U.S.S. Callaghan DD-994, and an executive officer tour aboard U.S.S. Downes FF-070. 
Commander Fogarty's duties ashore included scheduler for the commander in chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, exercises and plans officer for the commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet, and the Office of Legislative Affairs. 
As Assistant Director of the Navy's Senate Liaison Office for the last 5 years, Commander Fogarty has provided timely support and accurate information on Navy plans and programs. Working closely with the U.S. Senate, he has helped maintain the best trained, best equipped, and best prepared Navy in the world. His consummate leadership, integrity, and tireless energy serve as an example for us all. 
Mr. President, Sean Fogarty, his wife, Anita, and daughters, Larissa, Colleen, and Megan have made many sacrifices during his 24-year naval career. They have made significant contributions to the outstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. During his illustrious career, Commander Fogarty has been the recipient of many awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit. He is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves. As he now retires from the naval service, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and following seas.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I strongly support, and will be proud to vote for, the Balance Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. With these two bills, Congress has finally kept the promises made to Americans to balance the budget and to cut their taxes. 
When I talk to folks back home in Idaho, they always ask the same question: When is Congress going to get its act together and balance the budget and reduce our taxes? 
These folks aren't asking for much. They just want the Federal Government to stop spending so much of their hard earned money and leave more at home so they can pay their bills and raise their families. 
Now, when these two bills become law, I can go home I can look them in the eye and say. `We heard you and we took action.' 
I am proud to be a member of the Congress that had the discipline and the courage to balance the budget and cut taxes. This is a historic time in Congress. We have stopped the out of control spending frenzy in Washington, DC and have reestablished fiscal responsibility to the Federal Government. 
We balance the budget by 2002, the first time in nearly 30 years. I was in high school when the budget was last balanced. My daughter just graduated from high school. An entire generation of budget deficit. We must stop accumulating debt for our children and their children to pay. With a national debt of more than $5 trillion its time we balanced the budget. 
We also provide the first tax cut in 16 years--$96 billion over the next 5 years. We didn't balance the budget by raising their taxes. We let folks keep more of what they earn. 
Three-quarters of the tax cuts from this bill go to those making less than $75,000 a year. Taxes for a family with two kids making $30,000 a year will see their taxes cut 50 percent. In a State like Idaho, where the median household income is about $20,000, this is significant relief to those who deserve and need it most. 
This tax cut empowers American families with choices which allow them to better plan their future and the future of their children. This tax cut bill provides a permanent $500 per child tax credit for families with children under the age of 17. Families can spend and invest this money in ways they think best, and families will do that better than government ever will. 
We also encourage the education of future generations. This bill creates HOPE scholarship tax credits for families already paying for higher education. We create tax free education investment accounts so families can save for future education expenses. Families can also make penalty-free withdrawals from existing IRA's for educational purposes. We've brought the dream of affording college to more American families. 
We also reward the financial success of current generations, not penalize it, by reducing capital gains taxes from 28 percent to 20 percent. We increase the death tax exemption from the current $600,000 to $1,000,000 over the next 10 years. We allow families not to pay tax on money they receive from the sale of their homes. We raise the death tax exemption on small businesses and farms up to $1.3 million effective January 1, 1998. No longer will we tax out of existence businesses that have been in families for generations by forcing the heirs to sell the business just to pay the estate taxes. 
Last week an Idaho couple, Chuck and Sarah Johnson, came in to see me about the death tax and the threat it poses to their families' future. The Johnsons, who own and operate a dairy farm in Meridian, ID, told me that unless Congress changes the current confiscatory estate tax laws on small businesses they will not be able to pass on their lives' work to their sons. 
The Johnsons' assets, like most family businesses, are in the land and equipment used to run the operation. They don't have nonproductive cash laying around to pay taxes. Small business is the economic life blood of Idaho and the nation, and this legislation recognizes and rewards families like the Johnsons for their hard work. 
I am proud to vote in favor of the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. In 1992, when I submitted my name for election to the U.S. Senate, I promised to expand tax credits for parents with children, to cut capital gains taxes, to reduce death taxes, to expand individual retirement accounts to pay for education expenses. With passage of these bills the Congress has accomplished these important goals. 
Promises made, promises kept; taxes cut and the budget balanced.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, may I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his efforts on this issue. I applaud him on that. It is long overdue. Therefore, I must rise in opposition to the Senator from California, for whom I have the utmost respect. She and I happen to have served as mayors in this country at the same time. I prefer it when we are on the same side of an issue. I look forward to that day again. 
The time to alleviate the problems being faced by the ninth circuit has long been passed. It is time for us to deal with this. The proposal to realign the ninth circuit was first considered by the Senate nearly 25 years ago. For 25 years we have known that we should be at this point, that we should have made the decision long ago. Yet, the option presented by this amendment would only serve to further delay this long overdue realignment. And further delay serves only to deny access to justice to the people who fall under the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit. 
The immense size of the ninth circuit is one of the problems. The next closest circuit in size is the sixth. The sixth circuit has a population of just under 30 million people. The ninth circuit has nearly 50 million people--70 percent more people than does the sixth. And the problem will only get worse because, over the next 12 years, the States which make up the current ninth circuit are expected to grow by 43 percent. 
So here we have a problem that is 25 years in the making and getting worse, and now we can see the projections that it is just simply going to be driven to the point that access to justice is absolutely impossible. As a result of the tremendous caseloads, adjudication by the ninth circuit is unnecessarily and unfortunately slow. Recent figures indicate the time to complete an appeal in the ninth circuit is 40 percent longer than the national median. 
The people of the ninth circuit are simply not served by the unneeded delay experienced within the circuit. The question before us, therefore, is not a question of politics. It is a question of fairness. The judges in the ninth circuit simply cannot keep up with the number of cases which are being decided. It is nearly impossible logistically for judges within the circuit to know the law as it is being decided within the circuit, and therefore you see inconsistencies, you see problems with not staying up with decisions that have been made elsewhere within the jurisdiction, and therefore we see the cases being overturned. 
So, should the people of the ninth circuit have to continue to face the unnecessary delays and judicial uncertainty which is becoming commonplace within the circuit? Should the judges of the ninth circuit continue to be burdened with a system which prevents the kind of collegiality which is necessary for effective decisionmaking? Any objective analysis of these questions reveals that the answer must be no. And, if the answer is no, then we must act now to split the ninth circuit and provide the people within this jurisdiction the access to justice which all Americans expect and are entitled to. Speaking for the people I represent, I say that it is fundamentally unfair to deny the people of Idaho justice. Yet, the amendment of the Senator from California would continue the kind of injustice that was exposed nearly a quarter of a century ago. 
In reviewing a proposal of this magnitude, I believe it is important to speak with those who are most familiar with the situation. With this in mind, I asked Idaho's attorney general, Al Lance, to share his views with me. I believe his words are worth repeating at this time. He said:  
My concerns regarding the ninth circuit include its unwieldy size, inconsistency in decisions issued by its various panels, excessive delay in the issuance of those decisions, as well as the circuit's very high reversal rate when its decisions are reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Furthermore, it is my firm belief that in view of the unwieldy nature of the circuit as it is presently configured, that the true significance of regional and local issues is neither fully appreciated by the court nor reflected in the court's decisions. Establishing a new Twelfth Circuit Court of Appeals will resolve these concerns and, at the same time, reduce the average case processing time by over 400 days to a time period consistent with most other circuits. 
In closing, I would like to quote another friend of mine who is the Governor of the State of Idaho, Phil Batt. With regard to the ninth circuit, he stated: 
The court has been overloaded for a long time, and it is in the interest of everyone, especially justice, to split it. 
That is what this debate is truly about: justice. I urge my colleagues to vote for justice and to vote against the amendment which is before us. Americans are entitled to justice and they are entitled to access to the justice system, and it is being denied currently in the ninth circuit. The remedy, as proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire, is before us. It is a quarter of a century overdue. It is time for us to take the right action and provide that access to justice for all Americans. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator Hutchinson. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution now before the Senate, even if it passed, will not end China's most-favored-trading status with the United States. The House of Representatives has voted to retain MFN status for China. Our current trading status with China will continue and based on all of the evidence I have seen, I believe this is the correct policy. 
We must not mistake the decision to maintain normal trading status with China with acceptance or approval of China's abysmal policies regarding respect for human rights, religious freedom, nuclear proliferation, or respect for intellectual property rights. 
I believe that by staying engaged in China, which the extension of MFN provides, is the best way to promote respect for human right, free enterprise, and democracy in the most populous country in the world. American businesses in China are advocates of human rights on a daily basis. By staying engaged in China, we can hear the cries for freedom of the Chinese people. If we as Americans cut ourselves off from China, who will hear these pleas for reform and progress and who else will be able to press China to respect human rights? 
It is important to note that leading advocates of reform in China, such as Martin Lee in Hong Kong, are strong advocates for the extension of MFN to China. We must continue to bombard the Chinese with capitalism. But if we isolate China, as has been suggested, and cut off ties to the free world, that's when you condemn the persecuted and their cries are not heard. Tiananmen Square was a prodemocracy movement by young Chinese because of their exposure to free enterprise and capitalism. Exposure to democracy, not isolation from it, will allow change to come from within. 
I have seen first hand the value of talking with Chinese leaders about human rights. Last year I traveled to China and I raised the issue of human rights violations with many of the officials I spoke with, including President Jiang Zemin. Pursuing trade with China is important so we can expose the Chinese people to the free enterprise system, capitalism, and other important concepts of our free and democratic society. Just like I did with my meetings with Chinese leaders, each sale, each meeting, each phone call is an opportunity to make our case for respecting human rights. Engaging the Chinese, not isolating them, is a faster way to achieve the reforms we all want. 
I understand that many well-meaning groups oppose the extension of MFN to China because of China policies which suppress religious freedoms. Many Idahoans have raised this issue with me but I would like to quote the words of Rev. Nelson E. Graham, the son of Dr. Billy Graham, regarding his work in China, `In the years we have been traveling to China, we have seen a definite improvement in the area of religious freedom for China's Protestant believers, and I believe it is a mistake to focus on the negatives and not reinforce the positive strides China has made in this area.' 
I also know many folks are concerned about the findings coming out of the hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee regarding China's efforts to influence elections in the United States. The timing of this vote coincides with hearings by the Senate Government Affairs Committee where both Democrats and Republicans conclude that China has participated in efforts to directly and indirectly influence elections in the United States. 
This is of enormous concern to me because of its threat to free and fair elections in our country without foreign influence. This should be thoroughly investigated by Congress and by Federal law enforcement agencies. Americans who may have assisted in espionage by China should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If the hearings and investigations prove the Government of China did in fact attempt to influence elections, this issue must be immediately and directly confronted by diplomatic and international sanctions so that perpetrators are brought to justice and that it never, ever happens again. 
But a vote on MFN for China is not a vote on the issue of Chinese espionage. A vote on MFN for China is a vote about what is best for the interests of the United States and its citizens. 
Regarding the benefits of extending MFN to China, Governor Batt of Idaho states, `There are valid concerns about China's human rights record; however, I think that to severely curtail trade with the U.S. would move us backward on this issue, not forward.' Likewise, a recent editorial in the Idaho Statesman endorsing the extension of MFN for China states, `The surest, long-term policy for ensuring a better life for people here and abroad is to promote free markets and friendly trading policies.' 
I believe we must do what is best for ourselves and what is most likely to promote progress toward freedom and democracy for the people of China and I therefore support the extension of most-favored-nation trading status for China.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yesterday the managers accepted my amendment No. 870. The amendment will continue funding for an ongoing shared-cost research program for hydropower turbine design--commonly referred to as the `fish-friendly hydropower program.' 
In the Snake and Columbia Rivers, dams and turbines generate energy that fuel the Northwest economy. But while these facilities are used by this Nation for a tremendous good they also are, in part, responsible for the death and injury of critically endangered salmon. Some young salmon on their way to the ocean pass through the slowly moving turbine blades. The turbulence caused by the blades can and does injure some of these fish. This Nation has spent well over a billion dollars to save salmon as a result of the Endangered Species Act. Stocks of salmon continue to decline causing some to suggest removing the dams altogether. In light of this it seems amazing that we are in the process of removing funding from a promising technology that will save salmon and improve the efficiency of this renewable energy resource. 
Phase I of the project--the conceptual/engineering designs--has been completed. Phase II needs to be funded for us to realize the benefits of the money already spent, and to provide the Nation with modern, environmentally sound technology. 
We simply can no longer afford to use 50-year-old hydropower technology in a 21st century energy environment. We must learn to balance our environmental concerns with safe and clean energy development. 
Preliminary work indicates that a well-focused R&D program can achieve major innovations in the design of environmentally sound hydropower turbines. For the last several years we have been pursuing a program funded by the hydropower industry with a modest contribution from energy and water development appropriations. This amendment will continue that program into the development of a biological design.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the energy and water appropriations bill and specifically for funding for the McCall, ID, wastewater treatment facility. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for including funding for this important project in the bill and Senator Craig for his support and leadership on this issue in the committee. 
Cascade Reservoir is a federally owned facility located downstream of the city of McCall on the north fork of the Payette River, and is the second most used recreation site in the State of Idaho. The community is currently operating with a wastewater treatment plant that ranges from inadequate to dangerous. Water flowing into the Cascade Reservoir in Valley County, ID, has reached a dangerous level of phosphorus and algae. This level is much higher than what is considered healthy for both human recreation and sustaining wildlife. The plant must be upgraded, but the community needs Federal money to do it. 
The most recent data indicates that high phosphorus contributions from the surrounding watershed have caused and will continue to cause significant deterioration of water quality in the reservoir. The situation is so bad in Cascade Reservoir that at one point, in 1994, fish were dying at a rate that was too fast for fish and game inspectors to count. The fish died because of the high water temperatures and low oxygen levels in the water caused by dramatic algae growth. In 1993, a severe outbreak of toxic blue-green algae caused the death of 23 cattle after they drank water from the reservoir. A public health advisory was issued advising the public to avoid contact with the reservoir. 
The city of McCall is using an innovative approach to solving the dual problem of poor wastewater management and lack of irrigation water in the area. Wastewater from the facility will be used to provide much needed irrigation water to local farmers. The treated wastewater will provide phosphorus and nitrogen which are ordinary elements of fertilizer. This will reduce the need for farms to use chemical fertilizers, while at the same time cleaning up the reservoir. 
This program is a prime example of how different levels of government can cooperate to benefit both the community and the environment. The cost of the project will be shared by the Idaho State Legislature, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the city of McCall, and the local irrigation district. 
Cascade Reservoir is a major recreation facility for the largest population base in the State of Idaho. Without this Federal assistance, quality of human life and survival of wildlife will be significantly impacted. In short, the $2.5 million for the McCall Wastewater Treatment Facility is crucial to Idaho. 
I am pleased that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee recognized the urgency of this project and included an appropriation that will allow McCall to once again enjoy a clean and safe wastewater system.

Through the investments already made at its national laboratory sites, such as the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, the Department of Energy has a research capability of both personnel and facilities, which can ensure that the nuclear energy program of this country does not fall behind that of other nations. But we will only be assured of keeping a viable nuclear option in this country if DOE proposes and implements nuclear energy research programs to safeguard our position as a nuclear leader worldwide.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. President, I am the new chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, and in the 12 months I have served in that capacity I have learned the subcommittee itself cuts a wide swath on all the issues that we deal with. This subcommittee resolves issues that are at the forefront of our national debate. We cope with the issues of values taught to our young people who volunteer for the armed services. We deal with the issues involving gender-based training, sexual harassment in the workplace, drug and alcohol abuse, and now, as a result of this amendment before the Senate, the very sensitive issue of abortion. 
I make it very clear at the outset what this issue in this particular amendment is not about. It is not about whether you are pro-life or pro-choice. This amendment is about where those abortions may be performed and whether they are paid for at Federal Government expense. This amendment would repeal the prohibition on using Department of Defense facilities for abortions and allow prepaid abortions to be performed in these taxpayer-funded facilities and by Federal medical personnel at these facilities. 
The sponsors of this amendment argue that without this amendment, women in the Armed Forces stationed overseas may find it difficult to have access to a safe abortion. As a result, this interferes with their constitutional right to an abortion, so they contend. 
I want to acknowledge that women who are in the Armed Forces and are stationed overseas in countries where abortion is not legal, are faced with complex emotional and difficult decisions. I note for the record, however, that a woman with a pregnancy who is in the armed services who is overseas and that pregnancy is medically life-threatening or the result of rape or incest, under current policy, can receive an abortion at a U.S. military hospital. 
So the issue before the Senate is, what is the right abortion policy that our military hospitals should follow in cases where the life of the mother is not at stake or rape and incest is not involved? 
After reading last year's debate and listening to the debate today, I offer these observations. While women in this country still have a constitutional right to have abortions, our national policy as a result of the Hyde amendment is that taxpayers should not be required to pay for abortions except in the circumstance where the life of the mother is at risk or in instances of rape and incest. In other words, except in rare instances, Federal funds should not pay for abortions. 
But there is no getting around the fact that the Department of Defense military hospitals are paid with 100 percent taxpayer dollars. The medical facility is paid for with taxpayer money. The doctors and the nurses are Federal employees, paid with taxpayer dollars. So is the equipment, the overhead, the operating rooms, et cetera. 
Even though the pending amendment contemplates that women 
will be allowed to use personal funds to pay for an abortion, there is no getting around the fact that taxpayer dollars could still directly or indirectly pay for an abortion. So this amendment, if adopted, could lead to situations where taxpayers are paying for abortions, which is contrary to our national policy as outlined in the Hyde amendment. That is inconsistent with our national policy and with my personal belief, and therefore I oppose the pending amendment for those reasons. 
Mr. President, like so many issues this subcommittee handles, this one is one of the sensitive ones. I want to commend the Senator from Indiana, who had been the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel for a number of years, who has dealt in a sensitive fashion with this issue in the past. I appreciate the approach that he has taken. I look forward to his comments as he gives us insight on this particular issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I listened to the very good remarks of the Senator from Texas and I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator from Texas when he says we ought to open up Prison Industries to further opportunities. I will join the Senator from Texas in seeking every opportunity to do that, because prisoners should be working. 
These prisoners that he referenced should not be sitting in the air-conditioned cells watching color TV all day with three square meals and everything else given to them while they are giving nothing back as far as contributing to society. So we should have these opportunities. 
But the key word that is left out is competition. They ought to do it competitively. There is no reason in the world why we should have these jobs being done in the prisons and the product produced that then has to be subsidized. I think we have the intelligence within our prison management that we can have them produce that product but it can still be competitive in the marketplace. I know that is something the Senator from Texas understands, is good competition. 
So I support the amendment offered by Senators Levin and Abraham, and will support them, but will also look for those opportunities with the Senator from Texas to find ways of expanding Prison Industries so we can have more jobs among prisoners. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would just like to draw attention to something I think is very significant that happened last night among this body. That is, by a voice vote this Senate of the United States has continued to correct something in history that should have been corrected long ago. 
As you know, in January of this year, seven Americans were recognized for their heroic efforts in World War II, but it had been 50 years before the Government acknowledged those heroic deeds and 50 years for those individuals to have to wait until they were given the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
Senator Craig and I attended the White House ceremony in January of this year, where the names of those seven were announced. I say the names because they were not all there. In fact, the only living individual that was there was Vernon Baker, of St. Maries, ID, who was a lieutenant at the time in World War II. 
The effort that we undertook yesterday, which was significant and which is cosponsored by Senators Craig, Torricelli, Thomas, and Enzi, provides Lt. Vernon Baker and the surviving spouse and/or children of S. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr. and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the financial benefits normally given to recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The other Medal of Honor recipients, S. Sgt. Ruben Rivers, 1st Lt. John R. Fox, Pfc. Willy F. James, Jr., and Pvt. George Watson were all killed in action performing acts of heroism and had no surviving family members. 
All seven of these Americans, these seven who for 50 years the Government did not acknowledge their heroic acts by bestowing upon them the Congressional Medal of Honor, were African-Americans. No African-American had received the Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II. That has now been rectified; rightfully so. 
At the ceremony, as they called the names of those individuals that had been killed in action, I remember what effect it had upon me that there was no living relative there to receive the award in their behalf. Then I realized, for those who were killed in action, many were so young, teenagers--each performing that act where he sacrificed his life--they didn't have time to be married and they certainly didn't have time, therefore, to have a family, raise a family. They sacrificed not only their own lives for their Nation, but they sacrificed the potential of a family for this Nation. 
Mr. Vernon Baker is just a tremendous individual. To meet him is an honor. He is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet. His actions on the mountains of Italy taking strategic positions, repeatedly risking his life to save the lives of others, is really the essence of what this is all about. So, the amendment that we passed last night again simply states that those individuals will receive the stipend that goes to Congressional Medal of Honor winners after they retire from the military service. The history of World War II was not complete, and it was not correct, until these heroes were rightfully honored and the next step taken of providing them what they have earned through their bravery and the blood that they gave to this Nation. 
That has now been corrected. History can now be complete and correct in this regard as to World War II. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would extend the Reserve affiliation bonus to the Coast Guard. 
The Coast Guard approached the committee after our markup was over requesting that they be included in the Reserve affiliation bonus. The Coast Guard has been experiencing difficulty in recruiting for the Coast Guard Reserve and believe that the Reserve affiliation bonus will assist by providing an additional incentive for members of the Coast Guard who are leaving active duty to enlist directly in the Coast Guard Reserve. 
I will point out that this authority is discretionary and was requested by the Coast Guard. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would increase the number of years of active commissioned service provided for mandatory retirement of generals and admirals serving in grades of lieutenant general or vice admiral and general or admiral. 
The committee has noted over the past several years that the military services are moving senior officers through critical command and staff positions very quickly. One reason that these senior officers move so frequently is that there are only a few years in which a three-or four-star general or admiral can serve before reaching the mandatory retirement point of 35 years of service. This amendment raises the mandatory retirement point for three stars from 35 years to 38 years of service and the mandatory retirement point for four-star officers from 35 years to 40 years of service. 
This amendment does not increase the number of general or flag officers. Nor does it require that three- and four-star officers serve to the mandatory retirement point. The services still have the officer management tools currently in effect which permit the service Chief and the service Secretary to manage their officer force in the best interests of their service. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it was my intention to introduce today an amendment to provide three new tax incentives for private property owners who want to conserve land for the preservation of endangered, threatened, and other species. But the amendments were subject to points of order because they did not have accompanying offsets. Rather than have the amendments lose on a parliamentary procedure, I have accepted Chairman Roth's offer to work on these issues in conference. For too long, the Federal Government has relied almost exclusively on regulatory mandates and enforcement to preserve habitat for endangered species. That approach has failed to produce the kind of results we want. If we're serious about preserving our rare and unique species, and their habitat, we must make it easier for people to purchase and set aside land for species. 
The amendment would have consisted of three provisions. The first provision would have provided an additional 25 percent exclusion from capital gains associated with the sale of property so long as the property is transferred to a qualified organization for conservation purposes.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The second incentive would have provided property owners an exclusion from estate taxes for property that is set aside in a conservation easement. 
Over the past few years, as I've been working on legislation to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act, I've met with a number of farmers and ranchers and other property owners, many of whom own large tracts of land that they are willing to set aside in conservation easements to benefit species. But they are worried about the tax burden that they will leave behind for their children if they do that.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. My amendment would have allowed property owners who grant conservation easements to exclude the value of property from estate tax. That would make it easier for families to keep their property intact and at the same time will benefit endangered and other species by preserving habitat for them. 
My third incentive would have allowed property owners to donate land for conservation purposes to take an enhanced deduction based on the full market value of their property. This will provide an important incentive for property owners who have land or water that provide habitat for endangered and other species to preserve that habitat. 
Over the past 3 years, I've met with many property owners who have said, `we would be happy to step forward and preserve habitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there was an incentive.' Well, this will provide that incentive.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in support of Medicare subvention. I want to thank Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee for including this important demonstration project in the bill now before the Senate. After 4 years, I believe that it is high time the Congress enact Medicare subvention. This project is part of the solution toward providing military retirees the quality health care they deserve. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support Medicare subvention. 
Mr. President, the Medicare portion of the reconciliation bill now before us on the floor includes two demonstration projects for Medicare subvention. The first will reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs with funding from the Medicare Program for health care services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The second demonstration project, Mr. President, will offer military retirees over the age of 65 the option to use familiar medical treatment facilities, with Medicare reimbursing the Department of Defense. 
Mr. President, in my opinion, these two solutions will address the frustrations many of our veterans endure after serving their country so honorably. Subvention gives America's veterans an option to choose the best possible medical care available. I urge my colleagues to support the Medicare subvention demonstration project with the hopes that this year we will pass this cost-saving, commonsense solution to some of the health care needs of our Nation's veterans.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation which is intended to provide tax incentives for private property owners who wish to participate in the conservation of land for the preservation of endangered, threatened and other species. 
For too long the Federal Government has used its enforcement procedures and its regulatory authority to dictate conservation in aid of endangered and threatened species. This method has failed to produce the kind of results we want. The Endangered Species Act as currently written is almost all stick and no carrot. I would like to begin to change that today. 
For 18 months I have worked on a bill to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act. Currently, I am in negotiations with the Democrats and the Administration on a bill that will provide a variety of incentives to property owners to preserve habitat through conservation agreements and plans, prelisting agreements and other preservation tools. 
I also have a number of ideas on how to provide tax incentives to private property owners to preserve habitat. Because of the opportunity presented by the budget reconciliation bill, I have suggested to the Finance Committee three of the many options I will later propose in a companion bill to the ESA reauthorization. Those three options are included in the legislation that we are introducing today. 
Let me emphasize that inclusion of these new tax incentives will truly benefit both species and people. I've met with many property owners who have said, `we would be happy to step forward and preserve habitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there was an incentive.' Well with adoption of the ideas included in this bill there will be. 
I have had critics that have said that we should not provide these kinds of incentives to private property owners because we'll have too many people coming forward and saying, `I have an endangered species on my land.' What is wrong with that? To my mind, that would be a welcome reversal from the current prevailing attitude that some have about the presence of an endangered species on their property. Right now you have a situation that some land owners believe that if they do have an endangered species, or if it is suggested that they might, they're just as likely to try to remove the habitat to avoid a problem down the road. We need to change that attitude if we're going to recover endangered species. 
We are currently at the crossroads of two systems. One where you have government overregulation that tells people what they can and cannot do on their land, and the other a system that encourages property owners to step forward and do something good for species because it's good for you too. 
We can depend on our property owners to do what's right and what's good for species. I know that our farmers and ranchers know how to be innovative and creative. They know how to help species. And they know how to manage land. 
The right system is one where we encourage active involvement of landowners through incentives. Certainly, I know that if I were an endangered species, I would much rather have a friendly and willing landlord--one that viewed me as an asset--than a reluctant one who viewed me as a threat and a liability because of some bureaucrats and regulations handed down from Washington, DC. 
That's what this legislation will do. It's going to make the people active partners. 
Later, when I introduce bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act I will also introduce a companion bill with additional new ideas to promote conservation through incentives. But as you know Mr. President, the key to legislating is idea and opportunity. We should take advantage of the opportunities presented by the budget reconciliation bill to help both private property owners and our endangered and threatened species. We can do both.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in congratulating the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of their capital. 
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism hold Jerusalem sacred, and the many holy sites of all faiths make a city a world spiritual and religious center. With the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, Israel ensured the freedom of worship for all faiths and access to holy places of all religions with the enactment of the Protection of Holy Places Law, 1967. 
Today, Jerusalem is a mosaic of many cultures, religions, and nationalities, of peoples and neighborhoods, of old and new. It is a union of contrasts with a unique character. Last year Israel celebrated the Trimillennium of Jerusalem, the City of David. And for the past 3,000 years there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the city. In fact, ever since King David made Jerusalem the capital of his kingdom, Jerusalem has become a center of Jewish existence. 
No other nation has ever made Jerusalem its capital in such an absolute and binding fashion. The Temple was built in Jerusalem, and to it the religious made their pilgrimages. Chapters of the Bible were written within its walls, and there the prophets preached their prophesies. The city's ancient stones, imbued with millennia of history, and its numerous historical, sites, shrines, and places of worship attest to its meeting for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Sanctified by religion and tradition, by history and theology, by holy places and houses of worship, Jerusalem is a city revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It reflects the fervor and piety of the three major monotheistic faiths, each of which is bound to Jerusalem by veneration and love. 
The Jewish bond to Jerusalem was never broken. For three millennia, Jerusalem has been the center of the Jewish faith, retaining its symbolic value throughout the generations. The many Jews who had been exiled after the Roman conquest and scattered throughout the world never forgot Jerusalem. Year after year they repeated `Next year in Jerusalem.' Jerusalem became the symbol of the desire of Jews everywhere to return to their homeland. It was invoked by the prophets, enshrined in daily prayer, and sung by Hebrew poets in far-flung lands. 
As a Christian, Jerusalem is a holy city for me. Jerusalem is the place where Jesus lived, preached, died, and was resurrected. I went to Jerusalem in 1994 and visited various holy sites including the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Garden of Gethsemane, and the Via Dolorosa. For me there is something very special about this ancient city and I am glad I was able to visit these sites unencumbered, as are all persons. 
For Islam, the prophet Mohammed was miraculously transported from Mecca to Jerusalem, and it was from there that he made his ascent to heaven. The Dome of the Rock built in the seventh century, is built over the site of Mohammed's ascent. 
Every year Jerusalem plays host to hundreds of thousands of Christian pilgrims who come to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and pray at the shrines and churches throughout the city. Thousands of worshipers pray at the Mosques on the Temple Mount, with their numbers swelling into the hundreds of thousands during Moslem holy month of Ramadan. 
Jerusalem is a special city for me, my fellow Christians, Moslems, and Jews. For the United States, Jerusalem is the recognized undivided capital of Israel, and the United States embassy will be established in the city by 1999. 
Mr. President, again, I want to congratulate the citizens of Jerusalem and Israel on this special occasion. As I wish them all my best for the next 3,000 years, I am reminded of Psalms 122:2-3. 
Our feet stood within thy gate,

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to give recognition to four very important individuals involved in the advancement of engineering and science relating to nuclear activities for our country, and specifically within the State of Idaho. I would like to commend Douglas C. Crawford, H. Peter Planchon, John I. Sackett and Bobby R. Seidel on their various efforts in this area which have warranted top awards from the American Nuclear Society. 
These four scientists, all employees of the Argonne National Laboratory-West, have made tremendous advances in terms of the science involving the safe generation of nuclear power. For example, Dr. Douglas Crawford was awarded the Young Member Engineering Achievement Award which recognizes a series of experiments on reactor fuels. Dr. Crawford has become a widely recognized expert in the handling, management, and treatment of plutonium. He is also the manager of the Engineering Division's Materials Technology Section at Argonne-West. 
Dr. H. Peter Planchon, who serves as an Associate Director of the Engineering Division, received the American Nuclear Society's Seaborg Medal which is awarded for outstanding long-term individual excellence in nuclear investigation and study. Dr. Planchon developed reactor modeling and experiments which have led to the use of passive response to accidents in sodium-cooled reactors. His work and efforts were demonstrated in a 1986 experiment in which Experimental Breeder Reactor--II, at the time operating at full power, was exposed to accident conditions. The reactor safely shut itself down without operator intervention. Thanks to Dr. Planchon's efforts, subsequent tests have shown that simplified nuclear plants could be safely designed for the future. 
Dr. John Sackett's contributions to fast reactor technology, resulting in new and better approaches to plant protection and safety, have earned him great recognition and the honor of receiving the Walker Cisler Medal. This medal is a special award which recognizes outstanding scientific or engineering research achievements in the design and development of the fast breeder reactor as applied to electric power generation. Dr. Sackett's efforts truly are outstanding scientific achievements which have led to better plant operation. He currently serves as the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for Argonne-West. 
And finally, the American Nuclear Society's Public Communications Award was given to Dr. Bobby Seidel for his exceptional service in communicating unbiased facts regarding nuclear power to the public, which, as you know, Mr. President, is not always an easy task. Dr. Seidel directs the student and faculty programs at Argonne-West and was the propelling strength behind the planning and construction of the nuclear energy display for the Idaho Falls-Bonneville County Museum. This is a particularly important exhibition of nuclear technology for the people of the Idaho Falls area because so many times a hands-on look at how this process works is a much more effective means of education, rather than merely reading about such technology in a pamphlet or newspaper. 
The American Nuclear Society is a nonprofit, international agency comprised of individuals who represent more the 1,600 corporations, educational organizations, and Government agencies. These people, most of whom are engineers, scientists, educators, and students, have created an astounding membership number of over 17,000. Each year, the society chooses the top contributors to the institutes of nuclear science and engineering, and recognizes them with distinctive awards, specific to their fields of work. I am proud to know that this year a few of these awards were given to four outstanding Idaho citizens. 
Again, Mr. President, I would like to commend these gentlemen on their accomplishments and contributions to the nuclear scientific and engineering community. These individuals are a valuable asset not only to Argonne-West, but to all of us who rely on nuclear power as an inexpensive, renewable, and reliable source of energy.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today it is a great honor for me to join in this tribute to a remarkable man who has established a remarkable career, Senator Strom Thurmond. 
Senator Thurmond has served America as a teacher, as an athletic coach, an attorney, a judge, an Army officer, a war hero, a State senator, a Governor, a Presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator, and, perhaps most importantly, a father and husband. 
What an honor it is to serve with Senator Thurmond in the U.S. Senate. 
I mentioned his role as father and husband. Mr. President, I am sure you have seen also, on those occasions when we are all together with our family members, the wonderful pride that you see in the eyes of Strom Thurmond when he introduces his children to us, when he talks about some of the great accomplishments of his children, and the twinkle in his eye when he talks about his family. 
While serving, Mr. President, in a variety of these capacities, it was as a circuit judge when war with Germany broke out. As a judge, Mr. President, he was exempt from military service. But Strom Thurmond, as soon as war was declared with Germany, traded in that robe for the uniform of the U.S. military. 
Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of World War II. We think about all that that meant. And, for many of us, we had not even been born at that point--World War II. One of the key, key events of World War II was D-day, the invasion. And it was on that day that this former circuit court judge joined in the invasion of the occupied territory, and, in a glider, went behind enemy lines and fought for his country. Because of that, Senator Thurmond received 5 battle stars and 18 decorations, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for valor. And we see that valor every day here in the U.S. Senate. 
Senator Thurmond set a record for longevity of service in the U.S. Senate. But it is his record of accomplishment, not just the length of service, that makes his career legendary. 
It is my distinct pleasure and honor to serve with Strom as my chairman on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond is a tireless advocate of a strong defense, a strong America, and the men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States, and with his distinguished, distinguished service in the military here is a man who every man and woman in uniform can look to with great pride knowing how much he cares for them and the duty that they are called upon to carry out. 
My colleagues know the strength of Senator Thurmond's convictions which can be measured directly by his grip on your arm as he discusses those issues with you. Senator Thurmond has never been afraid to stand up for his principles and what he believes in, no matter how the political winds may be blowing. 
In recognition of his career and his character, the people of South Carolina have elected Strom Thurmond seven times to represent them as their Senator, including the first time in 1954 as a write-in candidate. 
Mr. President, when we think about this remarkable life of Senator Strom Thurmond, who was born in the year 1902, think of all of the changes that have taken place in this country of ours, all of the advances in technology, all of the changes in the progress, the achievements of this Nation, of the world, here is a man who has seen it all. Here is a man, though, who has absolutely remained current. I hope that as I continue my life I can continue to be contemporary. When Strom Thurmond goes back to the wonderful State of South Carolina, it is the young people who identify with him as well. Here is someone they admire and look to. Here is a man who because of his inquisitive mind, because of his wonderful sense of humor, his energy for life, and his unending love for his country, people of all ages admire. 
We need the Strom Thurmonds of this country because it is the Strom Thurmonds of this country who are the role models for the rest of us. At some point when I conclude my career in the Senate, one of the things I will be able to look back on is that I had the great honor of serving with Senator Strom Thurmond. 
Senator Thurmond, as a citizen, I thank you for all that you mean to the United States of America and God bless you. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the Concurrent Budget Resolution for fiscal year 1998. This resolution charts the course to achieve the goal that the people of America and Idaho want and deserve--a balanced budget. With the spending targets set forth in this resolution Congress will balance the federal budget for the first time in nearly 30 years. 
This accomplishment has a very personal perspective for me because the last we had a balanced budget, in 1969, I was a junior in high school. Now, almost 30 years later, as we are on the verge of balancing the budget again, I have two children in high school who have never seen a balanced budget. An entire generation of Americans has lived their entire lives under the burden of a national debt that is now almost $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. Our children deserve a better future than having to pay the interest on a $5 trillion debt. This budget resolution offers them hope for a better tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I am proud to support this monumental budget resolution not only because it achieves a balanced budget and eliminates the national debt, but because it accomplishes these goals while providing significant tax relief to working American families. This resolution confirms that the money in the Federal budget belongs to the taxpayers of this country, not the government, and it s about time we start leaving more of it where it belongs, in the taxpayers pocket. 
This resolution provides families with a $500 per child tax credit, cuts the estate tax, provides a capital gains tax reduction and allows tax relief for education costs. And the resolution provides for these tax cuts while reducing Federal spending more than one trillion dollars over the next decade. 
This resolution doesn't forget our commitment to the elderly. We accomplish these tax cuts and spending reductions without making any legislative changes to Social Security, and we shouldn't, Social Security is not the problem. This budget also insures the solvency of Medicare by simply slowing the rate of growth while still allowing spending to increase 28 percent, more than twice the rate of inflation. This is an increase from $209 billion this year up to $280 billion in 2002. Without this reform the Medicare Trustee s report estimated that the Medicare Part A trust fund would be bankrupt by 2001. 
Mr. President, the budget resolution before us is a strong plan for reversing the decades old Washington habit of spend, spend, and spend some more. It won't be easy to stop this out of control deficit train and turn it around, but Republicans are determined to get the job done, and we will. 
I am proud to vote for this resolution and with it a brighter tomorrow for our children. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Senate Concurrent Resolution 27. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial resolution, sponsored by my colleagues, Senator Hagel and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. I would like to commend and congratulate them for bringing this issue before the Senate today, so that this body may take a moment to remember those who sacrificed their lives in Vietnam for our country. 
Mr. President, it is not enough for us to use mere words to express our deep gratitude to the men and women who fought in Vietnam, selflessly giving their lives to protect the interests of the United States. It is not enough for us to provide for the education and well-being of the sons and daughters who have lost a parent in a country they may never see, for a people they may never know, and in a war they may never understand. 
Nothing can ever be enough, because nothing can ever bring them back. 
But here in the Nation's Capital, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial--a 250-foot wall of polished black granite--will help us to never forget the sacrifice of over 58,000 Americans; 58,209 Americans to be exact. 
Seventeen more names have recently been added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Within the past 6 months, the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii has positively identified the remains of ten more American servicemen found in Vietnam by Department of Defense on-site search teams. And seven other American servicemen who have since died from the complications of injuries suffered during the Vietnam war. It is my hope, Mr. President--no, it is my prayer--that this will be the last time such additions are made to this memorial. 
How do you thank each of these brave Americans? How do you let them know that as a nation, we are indebted to them for their bravery, their valor, and their courage in fighting a war that was never officially recognized by the country which asked them to put their lives on the line? How do you tell them that they are truly American heroes? 
You do this by keeping their memories alive and by never forgetting them. 
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall helps to keep those memorials alive, and it helps the human emotional process which includes mourning, healing, and remembrance. This visual reminder keeps their memory alive in our hearts where they will never be forgotten. And I would like to add that I know this from first-hand experience. 
Mr. President, last year I took part in a trade mission to Vietnam with several of my colleagues here in the Senate. Before leaving, one of the most important things I did to prepare myself for travel to Vietnam, was to walk alone along the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, to clear my mind of all thoughts, except for those involving the overwhelming number of American names etched upon the wall. In that moment, I knew that one of the most important reasons for my visit to Vietnam was to be a voice for those brave men and women whom I will never be able to thank. 
On November 11, 1996, Veteran's Day, I was in Hanoi urging top Vietnamese officials to keep the resolution of the POW/MIA issue a top priority, and to cooperate in every way with the United States. As I met with Vietnam Party General Secretary Do Muoi, I told him about my walk along the wall, and presented him with a copy of `The Wall,' a pictorial of veterans and their families who come to pay tribute at the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial. Inside the cover of that book, I inscribed: `We have shared a tragic past together. Now let us work to share a bright future together.' Our discussion then centered on building our relationships as nations on the basis of mutual compassion. General Secretary Do Muoi was very animated in his response and said, `We deserve compassion, it is consistent with our history so full of blood and tears. Compassion is the key to our relationship.' 
Mr. President, compassion is truly the key to honoring those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I would hope that we, as a nation, never lose that compassion for our veterans, and never, ever allow their memories to be taken from our hearts. 
The wall is indeed a beautiful and somber monument which will ever remind us of those painful sacrifices made by these brave men and women.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to salute an outstanding young man who has made his mark as a professional athlete--jockey Gary Stevens, a native Idahoan. 
Gary Stevens won the Kentucky Derby on Silver Charm earlier this month, becoming the only active jockey to win the Derby three times. Gary won it on Winning Colors in 1988 and Thunder Gulch in 1995. Gary joins a select group of jockeys as three-time Derby winners. 
Gary Stevens' accomplishments are worthy of Hall of Fame consideration. And indeed, Gary was recently elected to the National Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame. At 34, he is one of the youngest to win election to the Hall. 
A native of Caldwell, Idaho, Gary Stevens attended Capital High School in Boise. He won his first race at the age of 16 riding at Les Bois Park in Boise. Even at such an early age, it was clear to racing fans that he had a gift and his talents would lead to something special. Horse racing experts say Gary is a master of pace--once he gets a horse in the lead, he has the ability to get the horse to relax and pace itself so it has enough to win the race. 
If needed, he can come from behind, as he did in the Derby. Gary says once he got Silver Charm in the lead, the horse's ears popped up, and Gary said he knew his colt was relaxed and in good position. 
Over his career, Gary Stevens has won over four thousand races and more than one hundred million dollars in purses. For all his success, he remembers his roots. Sportswriters heard him say after the Derby, `The kid from Idaho can still do it.' And his family and friends in Idaho are rooting for him. Thousands of fans at Les Bois Park cheered him on as they watched the Derby simulcast. They will always remember him as `their' jockey. His peers also recognize Gary's special talents and personality. He was elected this year as President of the Jockey's Guild, an honor because his fellow riders have chosen him to represent their profession. 
I know that every Idahoan joins me in congratulating Gary Stevens for winning his third Kentucky Derby and for his election to the Hall of Fame. I also want to acknowledge his parents, Ron and Barb, for their contributions to horse racing in Idaho and for raising such a fine son. Ron still trains horses at Les Bois Park, so the Stevens family remains a part of Idaho's racing scene. 
So, Mr. President, I am pleased to wish Gary good luck this weekend at the Preakness Stakes, where he will once again ride Silver Charm. Gary Stevens is a winner--a winner I am proud to say who is also an Idahoan.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act reauthorization [IDEA]. 
Over the last 2 1/2 years or so, this body has worked diligently to reauthorize IDEA. I commend Senators Jeffords, Harkin, Lott, Coats, Frist, and Kennedy, and all of the others who have contributed to the development of this legislation and to the debate here on the Senate floor this week. The education of our children, including those with disabilities, is an important issue, and not one which may be taken lightly. The efforts of the Senators I just mentioned demonstrate the high level of concern which exists on this matter. 
I would like to begin by addressing a matter which I have heard discussed several times over the last couple of days. That matter is unfunded mandates. As the author of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, I am well aware of this issue. In fact, I have worked on the question of whether or not IDEA, or similar legislation, should fall under the definition of an unfunded mandate since well before my legislation became law. 
Early in my work on unfunded mandates legislation, I included specific limitations on the application of such a law. Among those limitations were exceptions for a Federal statute or regulation which establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, handicapped, or disability status. Let me again say, an exception is included to protect the statutory rights of numerous groups, including the handicapped and disabled. Clearly, IDEA is designed to protect the rights of disabled students. Given these two very specific facts, I believe it is inescapably obvious that IDEA is not an unfunded mandate as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Public Law 104-4. 
One aspect of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act which did impact IDEA was the provision which called for the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR] to explore any law which placed an enforceable duty on State or local governments. Among the laws which the ACIR reviewed was IDEA. At the time, many groups contacted me in firm opposition to any consideration of IDEA in ACIR's report. I maintained that we should have no sacred cows, that reviewing IDEA in the report could play an important role in reauthorizing this legislation. While many people expressed numerous concerns about the final ACIR report, I think one aspect of that report was particularly notable. That part mentioned that the Federal Government needed to finally start picking up its fair share of the costs of IDEA, that we should contribute the 40-percent of the costs that were originally promised. I am sure my colleagues would not be surprised to find out that no one expressed any opposition to 
that specific recommendation. 
And I am pleased to note that the ACIR recommendation on funding has not been ignored. From the very beginning of the 105th Congress additional attention has been focused on the need for increased federal funding for IDEA. S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act of 1997, contained increased authorizations for IDEA to finally reach the 40-percent federal share for which we have aimed. In addition, earlier this year, Senator Gregg took the lead in circulating a letter to President Clinton, later signed by myself and 20 of our colleagues, requesting his cooperation in fully funding special education. Now that the issue of IDEA funding has been raised, I believe the increased consciousness about this issue will result in Congress soon achieving full funding for this important program. 
Mr. President, while we may have many different approaches on this issue, I believe we share exactly the same goal--providing our children, regardless of their level of disability, with the best possible education. Does S. 717 reach this goal? Quite honestly, the answer is no. This legislation is not perfect. No bill ever is. But S. 717 gets us closer to our goal. Through untold hours of hard work on the part of Members of Congress and various groups affected by IDEA, a compromise was reached. Because of this effort, we now have before us legislation which will make IDEA better. 
I believe S. 717 improves the implementation of IDEA for all affected parties--students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. The bill takes significant steps to reduce the paperwork associated with the current law and to increase the flexibility available to teachers and school administrators, allowing schools to focus on what should be their first priority--edu-cating young people. It improves the ability of schools to discipline disabled students in appropriate circumstances, most notably in any situation involving the possession of a weapon or controlled substance. It requires mediation as an option to taking disputes between parents and schools to the courts. It also enhances the ability of parents to participate in educational decisions which affect their child. All of these things together will help us provide better educational opportunities to students, both the disabled and non-disabled, and will ease some of the burden on schools which exist in the current law. 
Mr. President, as I stated before, the bill before us today is the result of a great deal of lengthy and painstaking negotiations. While it is likely that no one would say this is the bill they would choose if the decision was entirely up to them, it is the bill on which often opposing sides were finally able to come to an agreement. After all the work which went in to creating this delicate balance, I believe altering the bill would be detrimental to the fragile agreement which was finally built. With this in mind, I will oppose the amendments which have been offered on this legislation. While I understand the concerns expressed by these amendments, and commend the amendments' sponsors for their concern about the needs of school districts, I cannot support any amendment which could unravel the current consensus which has been forged. 
Mr. President, the legislation we have before us today will increase flexibility for schools, improve educational opportunities for students, and encourage parents, teachers and school administrators to work more closely together to address concerns about the education of the disabled. I am pleased to support this bill and urge its passage.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important issue of political prisoners in China. I want to thank Senators Helms, Moynihan, Kennedy, and Wellstone for focusing the Senate's attention on this topic. 
As we consider United States-China relations, respect for human rights must be at the top of our Nation's agenda. In that regard, today I call on the Government of China to release Mr. Wei Jingsheng from prison so that he may receive the immediate medical care he desperately needs. 
Further, I call upon President Clinton to make the release of Mr. Wei Jingsheng, and all Chinese political prisoners, such as the Tibetan prisoners of conscience, a top priority as our Nation discusses our relationship with China. 
The first amendment of our Constitution guarantees citizens of the United States freedom of speech, the right of people to peaceably assemble and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Mr. Jingsheng does not have these rights, and so I join my colleagues asking for his freedom. 
In the United States of America `We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.' 
That all men are created equal. This is one of our Nation's unswerving principles and we have never and should never be willing to, as President John F. Kennedy stated in his inaugural address, `permit the slow undoing of human rights to which this nation has always been committed.' And, as my colleagues know, there is a tragic lack of respect for human rights in China, which is why we are making these statements today. 
Mr. Wei Jingsheng's courage and conviction should be a beacon to all of us. He has received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award and I would like to quote Senator Robert F. Kennedy: 
Some men see things as they are and say `why?' 
I dream things that never were and say `why not?' 
Mr. Jingsheng has that courage to ask `why not.' So today, Mr. President, I rise and ask the Government of China: Why not--why not release Mr. Wei Jingsheng.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we have all read the stories lately about the floods in North Dakota, along the Mississippi River, in California, and last year in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. What we didn't read much about though was the unnecessary loss of life and property that was the result of preventive measures that weren't taken and repairs that weren't made. In some cases, those repairs weren't made because the local communities were told that the repairs might adversely affect an endangered species and that therefore consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service would be required under the Endangered Species Act. Public safety, human lives, and property were put at risk because of a procedural, bureaucratic requirement. And that's just wrong. 
Let me tell you about a community in Benewah County, ID, which has just been through this consultation process. Last year, that community, St. Maries was devastated by floods. We were lucky that no lives were lost, but people lost their homes, their businesses, and their property. The floods also caused significant damage to levees on the St. Joe River. The County began work with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Economic Development Agency to repair the levees last year, but the work stopped in February of this year when they were informed by the Fish and Wildlife Service that consultation under the ESA would be required on the repair work because there might be American Bald Eagles in the area. No work has been done to repair the levees since February, while the Federal agencies have engaged in consultation. 
The problem is that St. Maries and Benewah County are facing more flooding again this year. Snow pack in north Idaho is at 150 percent above normal levels. When that snow melts, communities like St. Maries that were devastated by last year's floods may again be destroyed and people killed if the levees aren't repaired. And in the case of St. Maries, it isn't even really a question of protecting an endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service has acknowledged that the levy repair work would not adversely affect the American Bald Eagle. 
We are dealing with a true emergency situation. And it's not just an emergency in St. Maries, ID. There are emergency situations in North Dakota, California, and other States too. That's why I am offering this amendment, along with Senator Chafee and my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig. 
Our amendment would accomplish three things. 
First, the amendment will allow critical flood repair work and preventive maintenance to go forward, protecting human lives and property in an emergency situation. It gives Federal action agencies--those responsible for authorizing, funding, and carrying out flood control activities--the authority to defer the consultation process until after the threat to human lives or property is gone. For St. Maries, that would have meant that the repair work could have continued, and the risk to that community may have been avoided. 
Second, the amendment will ensure that endangered species and their habitat are protected. it recognizes that in certain situations, some additional measures might be appropriate after the fact to mitigate the impacts of flood repair activities. Mitigation measures, however, should not ever delay flood repairs or preventive measures where human lives are at stake. And they must be resonably related in nature and scope to the actual impact on the endangered species. St. Maries, which is surrounded by millions of acres of State and National Forests, was told that, among other things, it would have to take out of farm production 35 acres and dedicate it to habitat for the Bald Eagle if it wanted to proceed with its levy repair, even though there is no evidence that Eagles would ever use the habitat. The total additional cost of the complete package for the mitigation that the Fish and Wildlife Service wanted was almost $1 million. That has to change. 
And finally, our amendment will require the Federal Government to share in the costs of mitigation to the extent that it is involved in funding or carrying out a flood repair activity. It is only reasonable that the Government, which both conducts activities that impact endangered species and also requires mitigation for that impact, to pay its fair share of the costs of species protection. Communities like St. Maries should not have to bear the burden of mitigation costs when one Federal agency directed the activity that another thought would impact the species and a third Federal agency funded the activity. 
I strongly support this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do so as well, because an emergency can happen at any time and in any community. And when it does, your communities also will want to have the protection that is offered by this amendment. 
But I want to emphasize at the same time that this is a narrow, targeted amendment to address a true emergency situation. There are many other problems in the current Endangered Species Act that also need to be addressed, but this is not the appropriate vehicle to address those broader, more fundamental problems. What we need is an ESA bill that provides meaningful reform, while improving protection of our rare and unique fish and wildlife species, and we need that legislation now. Indeed, the very fact that we face amendments to the ESA on appropriations bills every year--last year, the ESA moratorium and others this year--clearly demonstrate that there is a need for ESA reform and a need to act now. 
Many of you know that I have been working with Senator Chafee on a comprehensive bill to reform and improve the ESA. We have drafted a bill that will significantly improve the way the ESA works, benefiting both people and species. It will work to actually save species from extinction. It will treat property owners fairly. It will minimize the social and economic impacts on the lives of citizens. And it will provide incentives to conserve rare and unique species. These are important goals and ones which we should all be able to support. 
I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Chafee, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and the administration to pass legislation that will finally bring much needed reform to the ESA. And the time for that legislation is now.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that is the final step toward correcting a wrong--a wrong which lingered for more than 50 years. 
In January of this year, I attended a moving ceremony at the White House where the Congressional Medal of Honor was presented to seven African-Americans who had been denied the award during World War II. I can tell you, it was a solemn and dignified ceremony in the East Room of the White House last January, when the medals were awarded. Unfortunately, only one of the soldiers--Lt. Vernon Baker--was able to receive the medal in person. The other six died, unaware their heroism would one day be acknowledged. 
Like the medal itself, the financial rewards that normally accompany the honor are also past due. My bill offers the stipend that would have been earned by the three heroes who survived the heroic act which earned them the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
This bill, co-sponsored by Senators Craig, Torricelli, Thomas, and Enzi, provides Lt. Vernon Baker and the surviving spouse or children of S. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr., and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the financial benefits normally given to recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The other Medal of Honor recipients, S. Sgt. Ruben Rivers, 1st Lt. John R. Fox, Pfc. Willy F. James, Jr., and Pvt. George Watson were all killed in action performing acts of heroism, and have no surviving family members. 
Mr. Vernon Baker, the only living survivor, now makes his home in the quiet north Idaho community of St. Maries. He is a soft spoken, humble man, almost embarrassed by all the national and international attention given him as a result of heroism. In April 1945, on a hill in Italy, Lt. Vernon Baker performed acts of bravery above and beyond the normal call of duty, risking his life to save the lives of others and taking a strategically important position, which saved countless other American lives. 
Following the battle, Lieutenant Baker's commander recommended this hero for our Nation's top military honors. But during World War II, no African-American soldier received the Medal of Honor, and so Lieutenant Baker never received the commendation due him--until 50 years after the fact. 
An Army review board studied thousands of service records and reports, and determined that seven African-Americans should have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I am proud the last Congress finally stepped up to the challenge and overturned this stain on the Nation's history, when it authorized the President to award the Congressional Medal of Honor to Vernon Baker. 
My bill will provide Mr. Baker and the surviving spouse or children of S. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr., and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the Congressional Medal of Honor pension that they would have received had they been rightly given the award in 1945. My bill does not adjust the pension for inflation nor does it offer interest. Instead, the bill I am introducing today offers three American heroes only what they rightly earned in combat defending our Nation and the free world. 
The people of Idaho have embraced Vernon Baker as a true American hero. The State's Governor has awarded Mr. Baker Idaho's top civilian honor. The Nation has bestowed upon him its highest military honor. 
This is a fair bill that will help provide three American heroes with the reward they rightly earned. I urge my colleagues to take a look at this important bill and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. President, in closing, I will just say that as an Idahoan and as an American, I am so proud to have been able to get to know Vernon Baker, a truly great American, and his wife Heidi. I wish them all the best success and joy as they continue a wonderful life in the State of Idaho. 
Again, as an American, I salute him and the other six African Americans who are true American heroes. 
Mr. President, I send to the desk the bill. I know that Senator Craig wishes to now address this issue as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it was President Ronald Reagan who said, `Trust but verify.' Sound advice I believe we should heed today. 
Reluctantly, I rise in opposition to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Do I want to see the elimination of chemical weapons and deadly poisons? Absolutely. Will the proposed treaty actually prevent the use of chemical weapons? Not in my opinion. As I've listened carefully to all of the arguments, I have concluded the proposed treaty will not do what it is intended to do, and, in fact, may actually do more harm than good. 
Again, trust but verify. 
Like many Americans, I took notice when four recent Secretaries of Defense came out in opposition to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The opposition of Secretaries Schlesinger, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Weinberger is based, in part, on the fact that the treaty is not verifiable. In other words, we have no way of knowing if our `partners' in this agreement are living up to their end of the deal. Like the four former Secretaries of Defense, I am troubled by statements by CIA and Department of Defense officials that admit they do not have `high confidence' the treaty can be verified, key provisions `can be thwarted' and detection of small amounts of chemical weapons `will admittedly be extremely difficult.' In my mind, the admission of Clinton Administration officials that the treaty is not verifiable raises serious questions about the value of the agreement. 
The Chemical Weapons Treaty also contains provisions, Articles X and XI, which mandate the sharing of all chemical equipment and technology, including chemical weapons defensive technology, with other countries. These provisions might allow countries like Iran and Iraq to acquire advanced defensive technologies so they can improve their chemical weapons combat capability. This exchange of technical information, mandated by the treaty, may also be used to develop ways to defeat our chemical weapons defensive technology. Because of these flaws in the treaty, Secretary Cheney wrote `In my judgement, the treaty's Articles X and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the globe.' This mandated sharing of technology represents one example of how the treaty may actually do more harm than good. 
I want to point out that one of the conditions removed from the Resolution of Ratification directed the U.S. to renegotiate Articles X and XI to ensure the treaty does not inadvertently increase the threat of chemical weapons. The Clinton Administration viewed the requirement to renegotiate the treaty as a `killer amendment' and encouraged the Senate to strike this condition. Under pressure from the President, the Senate voted 
to remove this condition so renegotiation of these important articles will not happen. 
In addition, the President's letter to Majority Leader Lott on the day of the vote acknowledges that there are legitimate security concerns regarding the flaws in Articles X and XI. I'm troubled because the letter is non-binding and it will be three years before we will discover if Articles X and XI lead to the proliferation of chemical weapons technology. The President says the U.S. could then withdraw from the Convention, but by then the damage will have been done. 
If I believed this treaty by itself would stop chemical weapons, I would support it. During my own deliberations regarding the CWC, I had a thoughtful discussion with James Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Secretary Schlesinger made the point that although scores of nations ratified the Geneva Protocol which claimed to `prohibit' the use of poison gas, Iraq used mustard gas against Iran and its own citizens with impunity. In my mind, this episode demonstrates one of the weaknesses of international treaties which sound good on the surface but lack enforcement procedures in practice. 
I am also concerned about the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention which will allow international inspectors access to chemical businesses and other important national security facilities. The idea that North Korea or Iraq can come into the United States and examine our facilities and then take that information home to help their own chemical and defense industries is wrong. The treaty makes no arrangement to compensate businesses for the loss of this sensitive data. This is another reason I believe the Chemical Weapons Convention will, in fact, do more harm than good. 
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I understand the military threat posed by chemical weapons. I continue to support efforts to destroy the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner. I oppose any use of these horrible weapons and I believe the United States should threaten massive retaliation against any nation that might consider using these weapons against our citizens or soldiers. I am also very proud of the leadership role of the United States in the fight to stop the spread of chemical weapons. Without a doubt, this leadership role will continue whether or not we ratify the CWC. 
But we must also be honest with ourselves. The Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be verified. The treaty will not prevent countries or terrorists from acquiring or using chemical weapons. The treaty may in fact increase proliferation of advanced defensive technologies and the treaty may jeopardize proprietary information of U.S. companies. 
As I weigh these facts, I conclude the Chemical Weapons Convention will do more harm than good and I will cast my vote against the ratification of this treaty.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to, if I may, utilize this opportunity for a few moments to discuss this whole issue of S. 104, the ramifications and some of the particulars of S. 104, and in doing so, I would like to direct a few questions, if I may, to the chairman of the Energy Committee. 
I also want to acknowledge that I think the Senator from Alaska, who is the chairman of the Energy Committee, and my colleague from Idaho, the senior Senator, Senator Craig, have done a tremendous job on this legislation. 
Does this problem exists today? Absolutely. Are we trying to find a solution? Well, we certainly should, and I commend the Senator from Alaska and the senior Senator from Idaho bringing forward what is a solution. 
With that, let me ask the chairman, is it true that in July 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the Department of Energy's contractual obligation to take title to the commercial spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998?

To demonstrate, Mr. President, the fact this is a serious problem for many States, I ask the chairman of the Energy Committee, is it true that many States, such as Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, South Carolina, Illinois, New Hampshire and Virginia, generate between 80 percent to approximately 50 percent of the energy needed by their States through nuclear power?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. And if utilities in these States are forced to shut down nuclear powerplants because there is no place to put the additional spent nuclear fuel, is it true that these States will have to look to alternative sources of energy which has been part of your discussion, such as perhaps burning coal, oil and gas to meet the energy needs of these States?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask the Senator from Alaska, and point out the Senator from Alaska and my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, have warned the Senate, in light of the Department of Energy's admission that it will not be able to meet its legal obligation to take title to commercial fuel, the court may rule that the Federal Government is liable for the cost of storing this waste. Is it true that some estimates indicate that it may cost between $40 billion to $80 billion to store this waste?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Also, as I read S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, I see it will not interrupt the scientific assessment regarding the suitability of Yucca Mountain to serve as a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel. Indeed, is it true, I ask the Senator from Alaska, that under your bill, the Nevada test site is not designated as an interim storage site until after Yucca Mountain is determined to be suitable to serve as a permanent repository?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Regarding the Nevada test site, I referenced this as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am very familiar with the important work previously done at this site. 
For example, I believe the United States has conducted 100 aboveground nuclear tests and 804 underground nuclear tests at the Nevada test site. 
So I ask the chairman of the Energy Committee, is this the location proposed to serve as the interim storage facility under the Murkowski-Craig bill? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-kempthorne-id-19-19970410</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Regarding the Nevada test site, in the current fiscal year, Congress provided $230 million to maintain the site for possible underground nuclear tests. The President's budget requested $226 million for the test-readiness program at the Nevada test site in fiscal year 1998. 
In June of this year, the Department of Energy will conduct the first of two planned tests called the subcritical tests in the underground tunnels at the Nevada test site. Now these subcritical tests, which cost over $15 million a test, combine high explosives and plutonium to help scientists verify the safety and reliability of our aging nuclear weapons. 
I will point out that we currently have the oldest weapons arsenal in our history. These subcritical plutonium tests are compatible with the comprehensive test ban and they are supported I believe by the Senators from Nevada. 
I would acknowledge too that the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, had been a member of the Armed Services Committee. And I had the great pleasure of working with him in the committee, and was sorry to see he had transferred to a different committee. 
But when we look at this, I would believe then, asking the Senator from Alaska, we would see the transportation, in order to carry out these tests, of plutonium shipments to Nevada to carry out these tests; would that not be correct?

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I wish to thank the Senator from Alaska. 
I would like to say, Mr. President, that there is a problem that exists today. Clearly, this is not a debate of whether you are pronuclear or antinuclear. You have hundreds of metric tons of nuclear waste in over 40 States throughout the United States. We are looking for a solution. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 offers the Nation a safe and scientific verified solution to the problem of nuclear waste. 
The Murkowski-Craig bill says, build a safe, central facility to store this waste at a place where our Nation has tested hundreds of nuclear weapons at the same location. 
The other side says, leave the waste where it is, in facilities that were not constructed for long-term permanent storage. 
One side says, deal with this national problem. The other side says, let us hope the problem goes away. 
The Senate and the Nation face a clear choice, and that is to deal with this problem. I appreciate the approach that the Senators from Nevada have taken. I understand where they are coming from with regard to this issue. But I look at all of the nuclear technology, scientific research that has taken place in the State of Nevada over so many, many years. Again the 100 above-ground nuclear tests, the 804 below-ground nuclear tests, and that this is the same area that is being discussed in Senate bill 104 for the temporary storage of this nuclear waste. 
I commend the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, and the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, for bringing this issue forward so that we can finally deal with it so that we can finally have a solution to what do we do with spent nuclear fuel, because currently there exists no solution. And to do nothing continues that problem of no solution. 
I thank the Senator from Alaska and I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that point by the Senator from Nevada. 
Again, based upon this very series of questions and discussion I have had with the Senator from Nevada, it 
demonstrates there has been a tremendous history and knowledge over dealing with the nuclear issue in the State of Nevada. The millions and billions of dollars that have been directed to the State of Nevada by the Federal Government to deal with this Federal issue is well documented. And certainly Nevada has demonstrated that it has the expertise that is there to deal with this issue and is well suited, I believe, to help solve the nuclear issue for the Nation. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, may I commend my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, for giving an excellent view as to the bill that we are submitting to Congress today, the Surface Transportation Authorization and Streamlining Act, or STARS 2000. 
I appreciate the fact that Senator Thomas and Senator Baucus of Montana and I will be able to form this partnership, with many more partners in the Senate joining our effort, including the Senator from Kansas, who will be joining us. I also want to recognize that I appreciate Senator John Warner, who is the chairman of this particular subcommittee dealing with this issue of the national highway bill, for holding a hearing in the State of Idaho, for coming to Idaho so that the western perspective could be made part of the public record. Also, Senator Baucus, who came to that hearing in Idaho--I appreciate my neighbor from Montana coming over and making that effort; it was an excellent hearing--and, too, acknowledging Senator Chafee, the chairman of the full committee, making that hearing in the West a reality. So, again, it demonstrates that all of us, while we may be coming at this from slightly different views, are working together. That is important and significant. 
With STARS 2000, I believe, as Senator Thomas has pointed out, we are going to restore the integrity of what a trust fund is: a trust fund. So the money that is gathered for that dedicated purpose ought to be used for that dedicated purpose. Doesn't that sound amazing that we would have to even say that? But it is not happening. Currently we only authorize about $18 billion that are to be used on the national highway program. The full amount that could be used, the maximum, is $27 billion. So this legislation by Senator Baucus and Senator Thomas and myself would authorize the full $27 billion to be used for the highways of this country, because that is why we have been collecting this highway tax. 
It provides a fair distribution throughout the United States, and it is going to address the very key issues, such as extent and usage of the highways; the lane miles that are there; the poor air quality in some regions of the country, some of the cities that are having difficulty with poor air quality; the tax-exempt Federal lands, as have been referenced. In the State of Idaho we are 67 percent federally owned. In the State of Texas--I do not believe there is any federally owned land in the State of Texas. So you can see we come at this from different perspectives. Low population density--Idaho is the 13th State, as far as ranking in landmass, yet we rank 41st in population. So you can see there are not a lot of folks. Take the District of Columbia, for example, this city right here around Capitol Hill. It has a little over one-half-million people. The State of Idaho has 1 million people in the entire State, versus one-half-million in just this city. 
It also authorizes full funding for the National Recreational Trails Act, $30 million annually, something that had been talked about and was to have occurred years ago. It has not done so. We are going to do right by that. 
We also know there is this issue of the donor/donee States. Some States put in their share, and they get more than they put in. Other States put in their share, and they get less back than they put in. We address that head on by increasing the minimum allocation program from 90 percent up to 95 percent. Under STARS 2000 formulas and proposed increased funding levels, 
it would result in 47 States receiving greater funding than they do under the current ISTEA program. Mr. President, 47 States will actually receive more funds. 
Again, as has been pointed out, we really do provide for the streamlining, for greater flexibility, so those programs, such as the Surface Transportation Act--in essence, we double the funds in that account. We double that, and then we say to the States and the local communities: Now, with that additional funding, you make the decisions of where you think your priorities are in your State, rather than people back in Washington, DC, who may never have been to your State determining how it should be spent. 
This is the national highway bill that we are talking about. I want to underscore national, because it is to apply to all 50 States. That is how we are going to have good interstate commerce. The administration says they understand the needs of rural America. If they understand the needs of rural America, I question why the administration's proposed reauthorization of the highway bill cuts funding to eight of the most rural States in the country. 
What is this question of rural and urban? Let me give an example, if I may, Mr. President. Here is the State of Idaho. I would use as an example highway 95 that runs, in essence, from the Canadian border virtually down to the Nevada border, a little over 500 miles. Again, the State of Idaho, population of 1 million people. Let us take relatively the same distance, and let us go from right here, Washington, DC, and if we drive to Boston, it is 463 miles--about the same distance. So I am making it a good comparison. The difference is, here you have one million people to support systems such as this. In this area, where you actually go through seven States, not one State and the District of Columbia, you have virtually 43 million people as a tax base to support that infrastructure. It just shows you that in the less densely populated areas we do need to have assistance. 
Do you know there are trucking firms that enter the State of Idaho at Eastport to go through customs? Then they immediately exit the State of Idaho and they travel the Canadian highways heading toward Seattle, for example, and then reenter the United States. Why do they do that? As one trucking company, Swift Transportation, testified at our hearing out in Idaho, they have 5,000 trucks that run throughout the United States, but they said there are so many significantly unsafe portions of, for example, highway 95, they do not allow their truck drivers to go on highway 95 because of safety considerations. They said that is the only stretch of highway that they really have that sort of restriction on anywhere in the United States. 
Yet this is a national highway bill. It is not the national and Canadian highway bill. So we need to address this, and that is what this does. But it is not parochial. Certainly I am trying to look out for rural America, but I reiterate, this legislation does better for 47 States than under the current program that is in existence today. 
So I believe we have something here that is good for the country. It is going to put the faith back into what a trust fund is supposed to be. It is going to give greater flexibility for those of us who believe in States rights, the 10th amendment; that folks in those 50 States can make just as good if not better decisions than we do at the Federal level. So it has so much to offer to so many. 
Again, I am proud to be part of this, and I thank Senator Thomas and Senator Baucus for their efforts in this partnership.

 Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise with great pride today to pay tribute to an outstanding group of young women who have reached the pinnacle of their sport. Northwest Nazarene College's women's basketball team last night won its first-ever national title. The Lady Crusaders beat Black Hills State 64-46 to claim the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Division 2 tournament championship. It was the school's first national championship in any sport. 
NNC, located in Nampa, ID, is one of America's finest colleges. It consistently ranks among the top schools in academic national rankings. Now it proudly sits at the top in athletic rankings as well. 
Coach Roger Schmidt's Lady Crusaders entered the 1996-97 season ranked 11th in the country. The team finished the season with the most wins in school history at 27-7, and also won the Cascade Collegiate Conference title. 
In the national championship game, NNC broke open a tight contest and pulled away to claim the trophy. It was just 25-24 at halftime, but a pressing and aggressive Crusader defense did the trick and helped clinch the game. 
Staci Wilson paced the NNC attack, with 22 points. She also was the leading rebounder with 13. Erica Walton scored 12 points, and was named the tournament's most valuable player. Kari Smith added 11 points for the Lady Crusaders. 
Mr. President, I'm pleased to say that seven of the 12 players on the Northwest Nazarene College roster are Idahoans. Here is the roster of this outstanding team: Christy Farrar of Hillsboro, OR; Jessica Knowlton of Craigmont, ID; Jennifer Myers of Parma, ID; Kimberly Riggs of Boise, ID; Brooke Warren of Pomeroy, Washington; Kari Smith of Meridian, ID; Ellen Duncan of McCall, ID; Chelsey Hall of Grangeville, ID; Staci Wilson of Molalla, OR; Staci Kirk of Boise, ID; Sunshine Cecrle of Hillsboro, OR; and Erica Walton of Ontario, OR. 
I also congratulate the head coach, Roger Schmidt, and his assistant coaches, Becky Nichols and Duane Slemmer. And my congratulations also go to NNC President Dr. Richard Hagood and Athletic Director Eric Forseth. 
I am sure all Idahoans join me in proudly recognizing the accomplishments of these young women and the support of the students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community at Northwest Nazarene College.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the National Character Counts Week resolution submitted by my esteemed colleague, Senator Domenici. I have cosponsored similar resolutions for the past 3 years, and am honored to have the opportunity to do so again this year. 
At a time when we are exposed to a constant stream of violence, profanity, and immorality--both through the media and in every day life--the issue of character is of vital importance. Those of us in this Chamber spend a great deal of time trying to develop ways to improve the Nation. I can think of few things we could do to better achieve this goal than to emphasize the importance of character to younger generations. 
Those of us in positions of leadership, especially in the Government, have a special duty when it comes to character. Whether we realize it or not, we are role models and we have a duty to demonstrate those same attributes of character--trustworthiness, respect, re-sponsibility, justice and fairness, caring, and civic virtue and citizenship--which National Character Counts Week highlights. Unfortunately, far too many Americans have come to believe, wrongly in most cases, that these qualities no longer exist in the Government. I urge all of my colleagues to begin today to make that extra effort to show the people we serve that the faith they demonstrated when they voted for us has not been misplaced. In the words of President George Washington, `Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair.' 
Mr. President, I recently chaired an Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee hearing in which the issue of character was prominent. During the hearing I was deeply disturbed to hear that the lack of character, values, and discipline is making it harder and harder for the Armed Forces to recruit the high quality people we need to serve in our military. Testimony supplied at the hearing indicated that an ever-increasing number of potential recruits are unacceptable, in terms of ethics, education, and values, for the armed services. I am not talking about difficult kids who simply lack discipline, the military has always done a fine job handling those recruits. I am talking about young people who have no respect for authority, no respect for their peers, no respect for our society, and often, no respect for themselves. As a result, they lack basic values such as compassion, honesty, and integrity. Our military commanders cannot be expected to instill those kind of values in individuals who have lacked them throughout their entire lives. That process must begin at birth and in the home. 
Mr. President, with this resolution, we are taking a step forward in trying to teach younger generations about the importance of character. I am pleased to note that schools, churches, and civic organizations around the Nation are also seizing the initiative on this important issue. But our efforts, whether on the national or local level, must not end here. Actually, to be more precise, our efforts must not begin here. While there are certainly things we can do as a government, or as a community, to teach character to young people, these lessons must begin at home. We cannot hope to improve the overall character of the Nation unless the fundamental values described in National Character Counts Week are instilled in the home. No amount of moral instruction from outside the home can replace the guidance of a loving and supportive family. 
Recognizing a national week to stress the importance of character is but a small step in addressing the crisis of ethics the Nation faces. At the same time, it is an important step which I believe all of us should support. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his continued leadership on National Character Counts Week, and urge my colleagues to cosponsor the resolution.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today to express my complete and unreserved support for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
I think it is notable that the balanced budget constitutional amendment has been designated Senate Joint Resolution 1 for the second consecutive Congress. Bringing the budget into balance should be one of the Nation's highest priorities, and this designation demonstrates the Senate leadership's recognition of that fact. It also demonstrates the knowledge that, no matter what we do to balance the budget now, we simply cannot guarantee a balanced budget to future generations unless the Constitution requires one. A requirement to balance the budget, not just in statute but in the very document which defines our Nation, will truly make the Federal Government accountable--accountable to the American taxpayer of today and to the generations who will inherit this Nation tomorrow. 
Mr. President, future generations are what this debate is all about. An entire generation of Americans has grown up without ever having seen a balanced budget. My children are nearly the age I was the last time the U.S. budget did not run a deficit. In the interim, we have seen deficit spending become the norm, and, as a result, the debt has ballooned to $5.3 trillion or roughly $20,000 for every man, woman, and child in this Nation. If we take the time to look beyond the immediate future, to a time when our children--and for some of my colleagues, their grandchildren--stand where we stand today, as parents and taxpayers, we will see a vision which should frighten us. Unless something is done, and done soon, interest on the debt will consume a larger portion of the budget than all the domestic discretionary programs combined. 
Some opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment have said all we need to do is stop deficit spending. This is true, and in a perfect world it would also be an easy goal to achieve. But we all realize we do not live in a perfect world. We live in a nation populated by more than 260 million people, many with dramatically different expectations of what, if anything, their Federal Government should do for them. And they elect us to represent those interests. Unfortunately, for the last 28 fiscal years too many have tried to please all of those interests at the same time, all too rarely asking, `What will be the result down the road?' 
Mr. President, as I have mentioned, we are now living that result. The debt has spiraled out of control and a balanced budget has become a highly desired goal rather than a regular, expected occurrence. While we are slowly getting closer to achieving that goal, we must not stop there. Even if we balance the budget by 2002, a timeframe to which even President Clinton has now agreed, what happens next? What happens when the names of the 105th Congress become mere memories in our Nation's 
history? Who will ensure that balanced budgets will continue 5, 10, 20, even 50 years down the road? 
While I would like to believe that balancing the budget in 2002 will result in all future budgets being balanced, I simply cannot. Balancing a budget is hard, as many of us who must balance our own personal budgets well know. Future leaders will be sorely tempted to deficit spend in order to meet the desires of the people. And much like a generation ago, they will find it easy to appease everyone. They will find it easy to say, `We'll balance it next year.' The result may well be another 28 years of unbalanced budgets and increasing debt. To quote the Spanish philosopher George Santayana, `Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' Without a balanced budget constitutional amendment, we leave future generations to the mercy of whether or not their leaders will remember the past. 
Mr. President, over the Presidents' Day work period, I had the opportunity to speak with numerous Idahoans. They are good people who are very concerned about the future of the United States. During my week in the State, they overwhelmingly expressed to me that passage of the balanced budget constitutional amendment was one of their biggest concerns. 
The people of Idaho know how serious the issue of balancing the budget is, because, like most Americans, they have lived under a State balanced budget requirement for years. It has forced tough decisions and, in some cases, prevented Idaho from doing some things the people wanted to do. But, it has worked. More importantly, for all the difficult decisions it has required, Idaho has kept it. They have shown they are willing to make tough decisions in order to keep the budget balanced. In the process, Idaho has also made sure that its more important resource, its children, are protected. A recent report released by the Children's Defense Fund notes that Idaho is below the national average for the percentage of children living in poverty, below the national average for the number of uninsured children, and above the national average in child support enforcement. You see it is possible to balance the budget and have the government do those things which the people expect it to do. As a nation, we would be wise to heed Idaho's example. 
As I mentioned before, the people of my home State have shown they can and will live within a limited budget--on both a personal and governmental level. The members of the Idaho State Legislature stand for election every 2 years and must reflect the attitudes of the citizens of their communities. As in the past, they have passed a memorial asking Congress to approve the balanced budget constitutional amendment and send it to them for ratification. Their words bear repeating as we consider action on this significant step to restore the confidence of our people: 
Whereas, the annual federal budget has not been balanced since 1969, and the federal public debt is now more than five trillion dollars, or twenty thousand dollars for every man, woman, and child in America; and 
Whereas, continued deficit spending demonstrates an unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and legislative branches to spend no more than available revenues; and 
Whereas, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and endangering economic opportunity now and for the next generation; and 
Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to borrow raises questions about the fundamental principles and responsibilities of government, with potentially profound consequences for the nation and its people, making it an appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by their elected state legislatures; and the opposition by a small minority repeatedly has thwarted the will of the people that a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution should be submitted to the states for ratification. 
Now, therefore be it resolved, by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Congress of the United States expeditiously pass, and propose to the legislatures of the several states for ratification, an amendment to the Constitution of the United States requiring, in the absence of a national emergency, that the total of all federal appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues for that fiscal year. 
The call for fiscal responsibility is nothing new, it has been sounded for years. President Andrew Jackson said, `Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our population will be relieved from a considerable portion of its present burdens and will find not only new motives to patriotic affection, but additional means for the display of individual enterprise.' 
More recently, the American people heard the following words: `We must act now to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more money than the Federal Government takes in.' 
This sound advice came from President Reagan on the 
event of his second inauguration. His words were true then, and they are even more so now. For since he made that call for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, we have had a dozen more years of unbalanced budgets, a dozen more years of deficits, a dozen more years of telling our children and grandchildren that they will have to discover a way to do what we did not have the courage to do. 
Mr. President, when I was mayor of Boise, I not only had to balance my own personal budget, but I also had to ensure that the city's budget remained balanced as well. It was a responsibility that required tough decisions, both on my part and on the part of the good people of Boise. Together, we had great expectations for our city. We wanted to build new parks, hire more police officers, build a new fire station, and do numerous other things to make the city an even better place to live. At the same time, however, we had to face the fact that we could not have all our wants, we would have to focus on our needs. 
So what did we do? We prioritized and lived within our means. And in the process we built some wonderful parks, we modernized our firefighting equipment, and we lowered the crime rate. I would add, Mr. President, that we did all this and either held the line or decreased the property tax levy the final 2 years I was in office. As a result of our efforts, we were voted one of the most livable cities in the Nation by a national magazine, which called Boise, `A great place to raise a family.' 
Mr. President, we did all this, and balanced our budget, because we had to do so. It forced us to be frugal, but more importantly, it required us to find better and more efficient ways to meet our goals. And we still met our goals. We managed to do more with less. You see, a balanced budget does not mean we deny ourselves the ability to do those things which need to be done. It simply means we must do those things as efficiently as possible, and not waste time and resources trying to do things which are not truly important. 
Mr. President, before concluding my remarks today, I would like to address the concerns which have been raised about Social Security. During my tenure in the Senate, I have supported several efforts to assist Social Security recipients. It is based on my support for the Social Security system, and those who depend on the system now and in the future, that I opposed the maneuvers to add `specific exemption' language to the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Doing so, I believe would have proven to be detrimental to the long-term security of the Social Security Program. 
First, because Social Security is defined in statute, its definition may be changed by statute. A Social Security exemption to the balanced budget constitutional amendment would then create an inviting target, far too inviting in my view, to those who do not want to truly balance the budget. The Congress, 
potentially, would be able to change the definition of Social Security so as to include economic stimulus programs, health care programs, or any other program which caught the fancy of the majority of the Congress. These areas could then be funded by draining the Social Security trust fund while the budget, technically, remained balanced. The net result would be a rapid depletion of the trust fund which would endanger benefits for future retirees. 
Second, I think we must look at what a Social Security exemption would not do. Contrary to what some have claimed, it would not provide any more protection for the trust fund than now exists. It would not prevent the trust fund from running a deficit beginning in 2019, just as it is currently on pace to do. In fact, it would not extend the solvency of the trust fund by a single day--Social Security would still be bankrupt by 2029. The Social Security exemption would not do one thing to save the Social Security trust fund. Only balancing the budget--and I believe only a constitutional amendment will guarantee a balanced budget--and reducing the debt, will ensure that we are able to pay off the Government securities in which the law requires the Social Security surplus to be placed. 
Mr. President, the balanced budget constitutional amendment is designed to make the Federal Government do something it has not done in nearly 30 years--take responsibility for its actions now, rather than passing the buck to our children and grandchildren. In the end, it is that simple. Are we going to continue to mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future for the sake of political expediency, or are we going to accept our responsibility to make the difficult decisions which come with balancing the budget? 
I believe there is only one way to answer that question. We must act now. It is time for the Federal Government to cut up its credit cards, prioritize the real needs, ignore the `wants' list, learn to do more with less, and balance its budget. It will not be easy and it will not be pretty, but it must happen--and we cannot guarantee it will happen without a constitutional amendment. After 28 years of unbalanced budgets, we owe future generations the promise that they will not be forced to live with the results of our mistakes. Passing the balanced budget constitutional amendment is our downpayment on that promise. 
Mr. President, in the 1,697 votes I have cast as a U.S. Senator, the vote today at 5:15 is the most critical. How critical? The last time this Nation had a balanced budget, I was 17 years old. Today, I have a son who is 16. He will be 17 this year. It has been a generation since we have had a balanced budget. I wish that when I was a 17-year-old, there had been a law that said you are going to have a balanced budget. 
In the State of Idaho, we have a balanced budget requirement in the Constitution, and what's the upshot of that? After a century, our books are balanced in Idaho. We have 28 years of unbalanced books here in the United States. It is time for a balanced budget amendment. I cast my vote today not only as a Senator, but as a father trying to do the right thing for my kids. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina very much. 
I enthusiastically support the nomination of Bill Cohen for Secretary of Defense and commend the President for his decision. One of the encouraging things Bill Cohen said today, among all the other impressive things he said, was his commitment to the men and women in uniform. 
We have the best fighting force in the world, but you have to take care of them. So the quality of life issues that are so important to those men and women, whether they are four-star generals or new privates or midshipmen coming in, we need to take care of them, and we have a Secretary of Defense who will continue what Bill Perry was doing, and that is improving the life of our men and women.

Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 introduced today by my good friends Senator Craig and Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. This important bill will make substantial, necessary and meaningful progress in our Nation's effort to deal with the problem of radioactive nuclear waste. The bill is similar to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 which passed the Senate by a 2-to-1 ratio last year. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, which I am proud to cosponsor, will establish an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at the Nevada test site. The interim storage site will address our near-term problem of safely storing spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste while the characterization, permitting and construction of the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain proceeds. 
My State of Idaho currently stores a wide variety of Department of Energy, Navy and commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. This spent nuclear fuel is stored in temporary facilities that are reaching the end of their design life. This phenomenon is happening across the country as temporary storage facilities are used beyond their design life because our Nation has not developed a comprehensive policy of dealing with nuclear waste. Instead of dealing with this difficult issue, for far too long our Government, under Democratic and Republican leadership, has kicked the hard decisions down the road. The Craig-Murkowski bill will tackle this difficult problem and it deserves the support of the Congress and the administration. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 directs the Environmental Protection Agency's role to determine the appropriate radiation protection standards for the interim storage facility. The language directing establishment of an interim storage facility complies with the National Environmental Protection Act which requires preparation of an environmental impact statement before operation of the interim storage facility can begin. The Craig-Murkowski bill also directs that all shipments to the interim storage facility must comply with existing transportation laws and standards. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act offers justice to the rate payers and electric utilities who have paid into the nuclear waste fund and gotten little if any benefit from those fees. After collecting billions in fees, the Craig-Murkowski bill will force the Federal Government to provide the storage facility promised to those currently storing spent nuclear fuel. 
Mr. President, this is a very good bill which solves a vexing nation problem. The Craig-Murkowski bill will make important progress in the way the United States stores radioactive nuclear waste. The bill will show the citizens of this country that this Congress will solve tough problems in a fair and rational manner. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 and I want to thank Senators Craig and Murkowski for their tenacious determination to solve this national problem.
