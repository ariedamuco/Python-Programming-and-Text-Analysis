   Mr. BAUCUS. Although I am unable to vote for or against the omnibus legislation before the Senate today, I would like to comment on the process that brought us here. In an effort to improve the economy of my state and to facilitate trade between America and its East Asian trading partners, I have led a trade mission of Montanans to East Asia for the last several days, meeting with trade officials in Japan, China and Korea. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely concerned about the process that has brought about this omnibus bill's passage. It is unfortunate that the Senate finds itself in virtually the same position as it did the last two years with appropriations matters. As my colleagues will recall, in 1998 we voted on a giant omnibus appropriations bill which contained eight appropriations bills, plus numerous other authorizing legislation. It ran on for nearly 4,000 pages and was called a ``gargantuan monstrosity'' by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD. 
   Unfortunately, we did not learn our lesson in 1998. Last year Congress wrapped Medicare provider payments into appropriations for Commerce-State-Justice, Foreign Operations Appropriations, Interior and Labor-HHS, again passing it in omnibus fashion without time for senators to read through the bill and raise concerns about its contents. 
   I voted against the 1998 and 1999 omnibus bills, not because they did not contain good provisions for the country and my State of Montana. They did. I opposed these bills because I believed--as I do now--that writing such legislation behind closed doors among a small group of people dangerously disenfranchises most senators, House members, and the American people. 
   And here we are again, passing Labor-HHS along with Treasury-Postal and Legislative Appropriations--all in one bill, with the input of very few members of Congress. Despite statements in 1998 and 1999 that such a process would not happen again, we find ourselves in the same position as the last two years. Mr. President, we already face a population that is increasingly cynical of government and those who serve it, and the wrangling over the presidential election that just ended has not helped matters. People believe more and more that government does not look after their interests, but only after special interests. And the more we operate behind closed doors, without an open, public process, the more we feed that cynicism. That is not healthy for our democracy or our people, and it's why I cannot support this omnibus bill. 
   That said, Mr. President, there is good news for Montana health care in this bill, provisions that I have fought for all year. In particular, I want to reiterate my support for year-long efforts to restore funding to health care providers negatively impacted by the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997. 
   When the BBA was passed in 1997, it was heralded as landmark legislation to extend the life of Medicare's trust fund and impose some much-needed fiscal discipline on the program. Indeed, just eight years ago, estimates indicated that Medicare's hospital trust fund would run dry in 1999. But a strong economy and reductions in payments to Medicare providers through the BBA have extended the life of the Part A Trust Fund for probably a couple of decades. Unfortunately, access to quality health care may have been compromised in the process. 
   For example, the BBA included new prospective payment systems for Medicare providers of hospital, skilled nursing and home health care. While these payment systems are intended to introduce efficiency to Medicare and ultimately increase the quality and availability of patient care, in some cases they may not make sense. I am concerned that PPSs may be ill-applied in the case of small, rural facilities, which do not have the patient volume to survive under a system of flat-rate payments. 
   Consider home health care, for example. As costs for this important benefit spiraled out of control, and as reports circulated of fly-by-night home care agencies defrauding the government and harming patients, Congress passed a home health prospective payment system as part of the BBA. Payments were reduced drastically. While these cuts were justified in regions of the US with too many home care providers, they also took effect where there was not a redundancy of agencies. Now there are some Montana counties lacking home care providers altogether. Montana has lost seven home health agencies, and there are currently three counties in my state with no home care provider at all. Together these three counties--Rosebud, Treasure and Big Horn--have an area over 23,000 square miles, an area nearly the size of West Virginia. 
   I believe BBA changes have gone too far in the area of hospital care as well. Last year I pushed legislation to spare small rural hospitals drastic cuts in Medicare reimbursement to their outpatient departments by exempting them from the negative impacts of the outpatient prospective payment system. Based on estimates from the Health Care Financing Administration, the effects of the outpatient PPS would have been devastating on small Montana hospitals. Madison Valley Hospital in Ennis, Montana, for example, would have lost an estimated 62 percent of its outpatient Medicare payments without an exemption from the outpatient PPS; Liberty County Hospital in Chester would have lost over 50 percent. 
   I was pleased that Congress acted to prevent cuts to these outpatient facilities last year, through passage of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, BBRA, legislation restoring $16 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments over a five-year period. 
   This year's budget bill has significant BBA relief as well. Although I believe too much of the funding is directed toward Medicare+Choice plans, there is significant help in the package for the well-being of Montana health care and Medicare in general. These provisions include increased reimbursement for telemedicine; special payments for rural home care agencies and rural disproportionate hospitals; correction of a mistake affecting Critical Access Hospitals' outpatient lab facilities; relief for community health centers and rural health clinics; and redistribution of unspent funding from the State Children's Health Program, SCHIP. In short, I am pleased that BBA relief is set for passage, and I commend the Administration and my colleagues for setting aside politics to get this bill done. 
   I would also like to make a couple of comments about the tax legislation in this omnibus bill. In this area too, I object not so much to what is in this bill as I do to what is not. The tax title of the bill includes a number of provisions to encourage economic development in distressed communities, the so-called Community Renewal and New Markets provisions. I support these provisions because I believe they can help spur economic development in many areas in the country, including in my own home State of Montana. I also support the language that allows Indian tribes to be treated like state and local governments in their payment of Federal unemployment taxes. 
   However, in this closed process of negotiation by the few, several good ideas that were in the Senate version of the Community Renewal bill somehow never made it into this conference report. There is not one single dollar in this bill to help Americans save for their retirement, which is a high priority of mine because I believe our country needs to begin preparing for the wave of baby boom retirements. The Senate bill included a wide-ranging farm package that is very important for rural areas that you won't see in this bill. It also included environmental and energy incentives that were designed to help us plan for the future. The loss of these provisions will become much more noticeable as our land and energy needs keep growing. 
   The bottom line is that there is a reason that tax items should not be included in an appropriations omnibus bill at the last minute, particularly when the tax-writing committees are left out of the process of writing the  bill. That is exactly what has happened again this year, and I again voice my objections to the process.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Among the most pressing issues facing American senior citizens and persons with disabilities is the need for coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare. While we in Congress continue to work to reach consensus on a Medicare prescription drug benefit, I applaud the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues to restore and preserve Medicare coverage for certain injectable drugs and biologicals that are crucial to seniors and persons with debilitating chronic illnesses. To this end the Act contains a tremendously important provision which amends Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security Act relating to coverage under Medicare Part B of certain drugs and biologicals administered incident to a physician's professional service. Because it is expected that the Act will be passed without any accompanying Committee Report language, and due to its importance to thousands of citizens, I rise to explain this statutory language. 
   The Medicare Carrier Manual specifies that a drug or biological is covered under this provision if it is ``usually'' not self-administered. Under this standard, Medicare for many years covered drugs and biological products administered by physicians in their offices and in other outpatient settings. In August 1997, however, the Health Care Financing Administration issued a memorandum that had the effect of eliminating coverage for certain products that could be self-administered. This changed policy interpretation resulted in thousands of patients who until that time had had coverage for drugs or biologicals for their illnesses, including intramuscular treatments for multiple sclerosis, being denied coverage for these same drugs and biologicals. At a time when the Congress and the Administration are seeking to expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, this HCFA policy has led to a reduction in coverage of many treatments. 
   The Act's language clarifies the Medicare reimbursement policy to ensure that HCFA and its contractors will reimburse physicians and hospitals for injectable drugs and biologicals for illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and various types of cancer as they had been reimbursed prior to the 1997 memorandum. The new statutory language contained in the Act requires coverage of ``drugs and biologicals which are not usually self-administered by the patient,'' thus restoring the coverage policy that was in effect prior to the August 1997 HCFA memorandum. In carrying out this provision, HCFA  should not narrowly define the word ``usually.'' Nor should HCFA make unsupported determinations that a drug or biological is usually self-administered. In addition, HCFA should assume, as it did for many years, that Medicare patients do not usually administer injections or infusions to themselves, while oral medications usually are self-administered. HCFA should also continue to take into account the circumstances under which the drug or biological is being administered. For example, products that are administered in emergencies should be covered even though self-administration is the usual method of administration, in a non-emergency situation. 
   I believe that to implement Congressional intent on this provision, HCFA must promptly issue a memorandum to inform its contractors (e.g. carriers and intermediaries) of the change in the law. 
   I commend the efforts of the bipartisan sponsors of this provision for correctly clarifying the intent of the Medicare reimbursement coverage policy for injectable drugs and biologicals. This issue is of vital importance to thousands of our citizens that are afflicted with debilitating illness such as multiple sclerosis. As Congress and the nation continue to engage in a discussion on expanding prescription drug coverage under Medicare, this is an important step to provide our seniors and persons with disabilities with the life-saving prescription drugs and biologicals that they deserve. I look forward to continue working with the Administration and HCFA to ensure that our seniors and persons with disabilities receive coverage for injectable drugs and biologicals.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a key member of my staff, Brian Kuehl. I will deeply miss Brian, both professionally and personally. 
   Brian has worked for me for four years, most recently as my Legislative Director, and before that as Acting Chief of Staff and as a senior Legislative Assistant. He gave his heart and soul to me, to his colleagues, and, most importantly, to the people of Montana. During this time, he has proven himself to be a consensus builder--a tireless professional who brings together people with diverse points of view and who solves problems in innovative ways. He is fair-minded, balanced, creative, and a leader in every sense of the word. 
   Wallace Stegner defined himself as a citizen of the West. Brian fits that mold. Brian came to me from Bozeman, Montana. He attended law school in Colorado and has family roots in Utah and throughout the northwest. His wife is a fifth generation Wyoming native  and daughter of former Governor Mike Sullivan. In fact, they are moving to Sheridan, Wyoming, where they will soon have their first child. 
   As a citizen of the West, Brian has chosen to tackle those issues that most often divide westerners--natural resources, energy, and the environment. Time and again, his ability to bring people together has demonstrated that the West need not be divided on these issues--that we can and must work together if we are to build a sustainable region with a society as inspiring as our landscape. 
   Let me mention a few examples of the significant solutions that Brian has helped forge over the last four years. 
   When Brian joined me in the spring of 1997, he had just helped broker a compromise among the White House, regional conservation organizations, and a large mining company, Battle Mountain Gold, that would conserve an area next to Cooke City, Montana, right on the doorstep of Yellowstone National Park. The proposed New World gold mine had been immensely controversial, with the project expected to generate millions of tons of acidic mine waste. Across the West, controversies such as this usually drag on endlessly, dividing communities and draining resources. 
   Brian had worked closely with all the actors while he was in the non-profit sector. His first task in my office was to help secure approval of this agreement in the Congress. In the end, Congress funded the public commitment and also agreed to invest funds to rehabilitate the Going-to-the-Sun Road to compensate local communities for lost economic opportunities. 
   What a great start to Brian's tenure here. 
   In 1997 and 1998, Brian helped me pass legislation to complete the final phase of the Gallatin II Land Exchange--one of the most complex and multifaceted land exchanges ever completed by the Forest Service. Brian worked tirelessly with all of the interests in this exchange--sportsmen, conservationists, the snowmobile community, the timber industry, local ranchers, and local homeowners. Ultimately, the Gallatin II Land Exchange became law. We secured a tremendous resource for our children and grandchildren. And every interest concerned supported the compromises that Brian helped forge. 
   In 1998, Brian helped me with legislation on another series of land exchanges near Helena, Montana, at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. Working with the cabin owners and local sportsmen, Brian helped me create a novel arrangement that was supported by everyone involved. 
   These are just a few illustrations of the many significant contributions Brian Kuehl has made to me and to the people of Montana. I thank Brian for those contributions. I thank him for serving as role model for the younger staff in my office. I thank him for his service as a key advisor to me. 
   Albert Einstein once said, ``Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.'' Well, Brian has demonstrated both success and value over the past four years. I wish the best for Brian, his wife Michelle, and their soon to be born child.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I am concerned that this legislation could be used to delay the EPA's chemical testing programs including the proposed Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, the agency's children's health testing initiatives, and EPA's pesticide registration/re-registration process. Can my colleague from Ohio assure me that nothing in this bill is intended to prevent or slow the implementation of existing statutory mandates under the Food Quality Protection Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act for these important programs?

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the legislation before us today on Foreign Sales Corporations, FSC. However, I really object to the fact that we even have to address the issue of the FSC during this session of Congress. 
   The European Union, despite rhetoric in support for the WTO, is taking action after action that raises real doubt about their commitment. Let's quickly review the history that brought us to this place today. 
   The United States created the DISC in the early 1970s. Given the different nature of the U.S. and the European tax systems, the purpose was to put American exporters on an equal footing with their European competitors. In the 1980s, in response to a negative finding at the GATT, we replaced it with the FSC to make it GATT-compatible. The Europeans accepted this alteration. 
   Fast forward to the 1990s. The EU lost cases to the United States on beef hormones and on bananas. These were difficult issues for Europe. Yet, the EU did not seek a negotiated solution. Nor did they try to take corrective action. Instead, the EU used every legal and procedural trick in the GATT and WTO book to weasel out. They lost at every turn. This behavior of the EU, honoring the letter of the WTO while ignoring its spirit, is inappropriate and irresponsible. The EU should be a leader in ensuring that the credibility and integrity of the WTO process is maintained. They shouldn't be taking cheap legal dodges. Why should other WTO members comply promptly with WTO decisions if the EU thumbs its nose at the system? 
   Finally, the EU could no longer delay and circumvent implementation of these WTO decisions. The U.S. retaliates. Then, all of a sudden, we find ourselves challenged at the WTO on FSC. As far as I know, European companies did not beat a path to EU headquarters in Brussels insisting that they take us on over the FSC. Trade ministers in European capitals did not rush to Brussels with demands to file this case against us. Rather, the EU bureaucrats, angry at having lost two important cases to the United States, were going to fight back. So, we end up with the FSC case, and another example of the EU undermining the global trade system. 
   Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Stu Eizenstadt has done yeoman's work in trying to resolve this problem. The legislation before us is the fruit of  his labor. And we should all thank him for working so hard, with so many diverse interests, to craft a solution. Yet, from Europe, all we have heard is a series of denunciations. An insistence that this legislation violates the WTO. An apparent eagerness to move ahead with a massive multi-billion dollar retaliation list against the United States. What a travesty! 
   I support this change in our law. And I express my appreciation to the other Senators who have allowed this legislation to move forward under unanimous consent, despite their interest in offering amendments to the bill. But I also call on the political leadership in Europe to step back and look at what their representatives in Brussels are doing. Please reflect on the danger to the integrity of the WTO of the actions that your EU bureaucrats have taken. 
   The committee amendments were withdrawn. 
   The amendment (No. 4356) was agreed to.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the important issue of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, its revision in 1999, and the importance of providing further relief to the many patients and providers who have been negatively affected by its implementation. 
   The BBA included a series of cuts to Medicare providers, including hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies. Though intended to cut about $112 billion from Medicare over the five-year period from 1998 to 2001, recent estimates indicate that over twice that amount will be cut by the BBA. And although Congress restored about $16 billion in funding to Medicare in 1999, much work remains to be done. Particularly in rural America, Congress should restore funding to Medicare programs for telehealth, hospital and home health care, among others. 
   Nationwide, 25 percent of seniors live in rural areas. And though the BBA has hit all hospitals hard, rural facilities have suffered disproportionately from the 1997 legislation. According to a June report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, small rural hospitals have significantly lower operating margins than rural facilities, on average 0.4 and 3.8 percent, respectively. Congress will do America's rural hospitals a great disservice by not enacting further BBA relief this year. 
   With respect to telemedicine, a means of providing care for Medicare beneficiaries with the use of advanced telecommunications equipment, Congress can act this year to further the use of this important tool. Mr. President, in my state of Montana, where over 75 percent of seniors live in rural areas, there is no psychiatrist east of Billings--an area the size of the State of Florida. Telemedicine could work wonders toward providing rural beneficiaries with access to specialty care, including psychiatric care. Although Congress mandated telehealth reimbursement as part of the BBA, the scope of that reimbursement is very limited. 
   We should also provide relief for home health care, one of the areas hit hardest by the BBA. Originally scheduled for a $16 billion cut, home health payments under Medicare were actually reduced by more than $68 billion, over four times the original amount intended. We need to preserve access to home care services by eliminating the scheduled 15 percent additional reduction in Medicare reimbursement. We should also provide 10 percent bonus payments to rural home care agencies, a provision that was included in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means BBA relief bills this year. 
   Mr. President, Congress should not let politics and partisan priorities to interfere with providing a basic human need to the people of our country. I urge my colleagues join me by acting on further BBA relief this year.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Mike Mansfield, Scoop Jackson, Richard Russell, Russell Long, Lyndon Johnson, Lloyd Bentsen, Bob Dole, John Chafee, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, who are these men? They were the giants in the Senate in the quarter of a century before and after our bicentennial. They are the models to whom we all aspire. They are the most recent generation of statesmen who helped lead our nation to the greatness of today. 
   I was elected to the Senate 2 years after PAT MOYNIHAN entered this body. I have had the honor, the pleasure, and the privilege of serving with PAT MOYNIHAN for 22 years. 
   In fact, I have spent two-thirds of my adult life working with PAT MOYNIHAN--watching this intellectual giant, listening to this scholar and visionary, learning from this teacher, this social critic, this political master. 
   Who is PAT MOYNIHAN? University professor, diplomat, Cabinet Secretary, fighter of poverty, social analyst, distinguished and prolific author, defender of worker rights everywhere, U.S. Senator, mentor, humanist, citizen, friend. 
   PAT published his first book in 1963. ``Beyond the Melting Pot'' looked at minority groups in New York City. Its conclusion was that the prevailing assumption at the time was wrong, that assumption being that minorities assimilated into the broader American culture. 
   PAT wrote his most recent book in 1998. ``Secrecy, the American Experience'' explained how secrecy in government deformed American values in the 20th century. 
   In between, he authored 16 other books--believe it or not; 16--on subjects that included poverty, family, ethnicity, and social policy. 
   In 1963, with ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' PAT was at the cutting edge, as we were beginning to struggle more honestly with the problems of minority groups in this country. Thirty-five years later, with the publication of ``Secrecy, the American Experience,'' PAT is still at the cutting edge. 
   We are struggling to transform our institutions away from a culture that fought the cold war to a culture where the Internet thrives. Openness and transparency are valued again, and information is decentralized, distributed, and widely available. 
   During those intervening three and a half decades, PAT was always at the cutting edge in forcing us to rethink our fundamental assumptions about poverty, family, Social Security, ethnicity, and a wide range of domestic and global issues. 
   One area where PAT has made an enormous contribution to bettering our society--and yet is little recognized for it--is public architecture. He was one of the driving forces--in fact, the major driving force--to renovate Pennsylvania Avenue, to complete the Navy Memorial, Pershing Park, the Ronald Reagan Building, the restoration of Union Station, and the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building. 
   We, and our descendants, who visit our Nation's capital will have our lives enriched because of PAT MOYNIHAN's vision. 
   Let me conclude with a quotation from PAT. In 1976, he said: ``The single most exciting thing you encounter in government is competence, because it's so rare.'' I would change that to read: ``The single most exciting thing you encounter in government is greatness, because it's so rare.'' And that exciting thing, that exciting person, that greatness, for me, has been DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   There is no higher calling than public service. PAT MOYNIHAN has been its embodiment for half a century. 
   We will all miss you, PAT, miss you very much.

This language should not be interpreted as pre-empting the authority of Congress to approve or disapprove an interstate compact, international agreement, or other such mechanisms of implementation which properly fall under congressional authority. it is simply the intent of the conferees to encourage the States to promptly take such actions to implement these standards as fall within their authority for management of the water resources of their respective states and within the authority vested in them by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 for making decisions regarding diversions of Great Lakes water.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate your concern about flooding in the Saint Frances River Basin and your frustration with efforts to address this situation. Many communities across the nation simply do not have the financial ability to provide the cost share for Corps studies and projects. Because of this, Congress added an ``Ability to Pay'' provision to the Water Resources Development Act in 1986. This provision, which establishes procedures for reducing the non-federal share of water resource development project costs for distressed communities, has been amended several times subsequently. These procedures, which are set by the Corps through regulation, take into consideration local economic and financial conditions. 
   This year, the administration's Water Resources Development Act legislative proposal contained an update to the Ability to Pay provision which included expanding its applicability to feasibility studies and additional project types. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee further expanded the project types eligible and this amendment to the Ability to Pay provision is contained in the Conference Report. 
   Our intention is that these changes will result in the Ability to Pay provision being used more frequently by the Corps and providing greater relief to communities that cannot meet ``standard'' Corps cost-share requirements. While I am not familiar enough with specifics of the Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou project to judge the application of the Ability to Pay provision, I would encourage the Corps to pay particular attention to the applicability of the provision to this flood control project.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Very simply put, we have a tax bill before us which includes some provisions that are unbalanced. That is unfair. There has not been anything that would approximate consultation between the majority and minority, including the White House. It is going to pass with a majority vote. It is going to be vetoed by the President, as it should. 
   Frankly, I know the majority party will vote for this bill very quickly when we get back together, and we will pass a balanced bill in consultation with both parties and with the White House. After all, that is by and large what the American people want. They want us to work together. They want us to pass legislation that is balanced. 
   Unfortunately, the bill before us is not balanced. It is very lopsided and very much toward upper income levels. Also, it does not include provisions to help lower middle income Americans, which I will outline a little bit later. 
   In addition, the bill before us is one that was crafted by the majority leadership, despite what has been said on the floor here, without consultation that in any way is adequate with either the White House or with the Democratic Party. That is unfortunate. I say that also because the Senate Finance Committee not too long ago passed out of the committee, on a unanimous vote, a balanced bill that addresses the tax provisions in this bill. 
   What do I mean? 
   First of all, the bill that passed the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis, with a unanimous vote, had one-third of the tax cuts directed to lower and moderate-income taxpayers to help them also save for good times. It is true the bill also raised contribution limits for people in moderate and upper income levels, as it should. 
   My point is not that those should not be raised. My point is there are no provisions in the current bill which also give the incentives to moderate- and low-income people. 
   In addition, it is important for us to reflect for a moment about the importance of retirement income. Sixteen percent of today's retirees depend exclusively and entirely on Social Security for their entire income. Two-thirds of American seniors depend upon Social Security as their primary source of retirement income. That is basically because Social Security benefits only replace about 40 percent of the income earned during retirement. 
   Who are those retirees who depend primarily on Social Security? They are people who spend their entire working lives making minimum wage and who earn just enough to make ends meet but not enough to save for retirement. 
   Only one-third of American families with incomes under $25,000 are saving for retirement either through a pension plan or through an IRA. That compares with 85 percent of American families with incomes over $50,000. Eighty-five percent of American families with incomes of $50,000 or over are saving either through a pension plan or IRA. 
   That is why the bill that passed the Finance Committee--again, unanimously--attempted to address that disparity by including a tax credit for families with less than $50,000 in income to help them also save for retirement. The credit was really one of two items in the bill that helped provide that 
   balance. It also made the bill more progressive. 
   The unanimously passed, bipartisan Finance Committee bill had a couple other incentives to help small businesses establish pensions for their workers. These were very important provisions to help balance the bill and raise limits for upper income Americans and also help provide incentives for lower and moderate-income Americans. 
   You won't find these provisions in the bill before us today. You won't find the provisions that passed the Finance Committee unanimously, on a bipartisan basis, to help middle and lower income Americans as well as upper income Americans. That pattern is repeated. 
   Measures that the Finance Committee, again, on a bipartisan basis, passed to help balance the legislation before us are not included in this, I might say, closed-door bill that we have before us today. For example, the  section on health care spends $88 billion, with $56 billion of that going to basically HMOs that subsidize people who already have health insurance. 
   I ask: Where are the provisions designed to help the uninsured in America? They are not there. There is no provision, for example, to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of the compromise. You won't find other efforts to help encourage people who are uninsured to get insurance. 
   As I mentioned and as many other speakers have mentioned, this bill was slapped together in the last couple of days. There are parts of it that almost no one saw before yesterday morning. We have no idea what special interest provisions are in here, and we do not know what mistakes are in it. There are probably going to be a few--again, because it was not written in the sunshine. 
   I am even told there is a section here that may have accidentally repealed the minimum wage altogether for 6 months. I don't know. It is possible. 
   Again, good law is not made behind closed doors by a small number of people. It is made by all of us here in the full light of sunshine. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote against this bill. But, more importantly, when the President vetoes it, let's get together and do something that is balanced for the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Commerce, State and Justice Appropriations Conference report's recommendation which provides $500,000 for the congressional-executive commission on China. This noteworthy commission was established in Title III of the China/PNTR bill, which the Senate passed with a strong majority and the President signed into law just two weeks ago. 
   It is my understanding that the Commission would normally require a funding level of at least $1.3 million. However, this year the conferees allocated a lesser amount based on the fact that the Commission will operate for less than a full year in FY2001. 
   Without a doubt, we should fully support the Commission at its requested level of $1.3 million in FY2002 and subsequent years once members have been appointed, staff hired and the operation is fully functional for an entire fiscal year. While the initial request of $500,000 is sufficient for the start-up operation of the Commission, it falls far short of the amount required by its enabling legislation and our congressional intent.  
   Passage of PNTR for China is one of the most significant pieces of legislation this Congress has passed in this decade. The Commission will play an essential role in the oversight of its implementation and China's adherence to its international obligations. 
   Again, Mr. President, I support funding accorded by the CJS Appropriations bill for FY2001 and will further support increased funding of at least $1.3 million in the next and following fiscal years.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I extend my deepest personal sympathies to Mel Carnahan's family. He was tragically killed in a plane crash last night. All Members want to serve our country as well as we possibly can. We go the extra mile to serve our people. We all know the dangers inherent with flying in small aircraft to try to attend political events and try to make meetings on schedules that are very uncertain. 
   All in the Senate are particularly grieved in this tragedy. We extend our most heartfelt sympathies to the Governor's wife, his family, to his campaign team, and all who were involved. It is difficult to explain how deeply we feel about this. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to urge that Congress enact the Retirement Security and Savings Act, which has passed the House and been reported unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee. This is a balanced, bipartisan bill. It will encourage people to set their own money aside for retirement, by reforming the private pension rules and increasing the amount that people can put in an individual retirement account. It also will create two important new savings incentives. One is a tax credit for small businesses that set up pension programs for their employees. The other is a tax credit for low and middle income people who save for their own retirement. If, before adjourning, we can find a way to enact this bill, it will be a significant addition to the record of the 106th Congress. Let me explain why. 
   The American people have many wonderful qualities. But, these days, unfortunately, thrift is not one of them. During the last 20 years, personal savings rates have consistently declined, from 9 percent of GDP in the 1970s to less than 1 percent now. In fact, the preliminary net personal savings rate for August is the lowest rate since the Commerce Department began keeping records in 1959. So what? Why does this matter? 
   In the first place, a low savings rate means that less capital is available for new investments. Perhaps that is not a pressing issue right now, with a booming economy. But it should be. Over  the long run, a low cost of capital is essential to our international competitiveness. On top of that, a low savings rate means that people aren't putting their own money away for retirement. That makes them more dependent on Social Security. In fact, 16 percent of today's retirees depend exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income, and two-thirds depend on it as their primary source of retirement income. 
   We need to protect Social Security. But that is not enough. After all, Social Security only replaces about 40 percent of the income earned during our working years. If retirees continue to rely so heavily on Social Security, there will still be far too many Americans spending their retirement years one step away from poverty. We need to supplement Social Security, by encouraging more Americans to save for their retirement. And we can start by passing the Retirement Security and Savings Act, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee. 
   As a threshold matter, the bill does two important things. First, it reforms the tax rules for pension plans. It makes pensions more portable. It strengthens pension security and enforcement. It expands coverage for small businesses. It enhances pension fairness for women. And it encourages retirement education. Second, the bill increases the contribution limits for individual retirement accounts. IRAs have proven to be a very popular way for millions of workers to save for retirement, particularly for those who do not have pension plans available through their employers. The IRA limits have not been increased since they were created almost two decades ago. An increase is long overdue. These are positive changes. However, by and large, they reinforce the conventional approach to retirement incentives. That approach can best be described as a ``top down'' approach. We create incentives for people with higher incomes, hoping that the so-called nondiscrimination rules will give the higher paid folks an incentive to encourage more participation by others, such as through employer matching programs. I do not have a problem with this approach, as far as it goes. But it does not do enough to reach out to middle and lower income workers. 
   That is why I am particularly pleased that the bill goes further, by creating two new savings incentives. One creates a new incentive to encourage small businesses to establish pension plans for their employees. The other creates a new matching program to help workers save their own money for retirement. Let me discuss each in turn. 
   First, the incentives for small businesses. Unlike larger companies, most small business owners do not offer pension plans. While three out of every four workers at large companies are participating in some form of pension plan, only one out of every three employees of small businesses have pensions. This leaves over 30 million workers without a pension plan. It is not that small businesses do not want to provide pension plans. They simply cannot afford to. Record-keeping requirements are too complex and expensive. The bill addresses this, by creating two new tax credits. 
   The first is a tax credit of up to $500 to help defray the administrative costs of starting a new plan. The second is a tax credit to help employers contribute to a new plan on behalf of their lower paid employees. In effect, it is a match of amounts employers in small firms put into new retirement plans for their employees--up to a limit of 3 percent of the salaries of these workers. Taken together, these new incentives will make it easier for small businesses to reach out to their employees and provide them with a pension. In addition, the bill creates a new tax credit that is aimed primarily at workers who do not have a pension plan available to them, to encourage them to save for themselves. 
   Only one-third of families with incomes under $25,000 are saving for retirement either through a pension plan or in an IRA. This compares with 85 percent of families with incomes over $50,000 who are saving for retirement. We clearly need to provide an incentive for those families who are not saving right now, and the individual savings credit included in the Finance Committee bill will provide that incentive. 
   Here is how it works. A couple with a joint income of $20,000 is eligible for a 50 percent tax credit for the amount that they save each year, for savings of up to $2,000. People with higher incomes get a smaller match, up to a joint income of $50,000. According to the Joint Tax Committee, almost 10 million families will be eligible for the individual savings credit. This will provide a strong incentive for these families to begin setting aside money for their retirement. That, in a nutshell, is how the credits work. Let me respond to the common criticisms of the proposal. 
   One is that the tax credit for low and moderate income workers is not refundable and therefore will not benefit lower income families that have no tax liability. All that I can say, in response, is that I am a realist. I agree that the credit should be refundable. But, this year, a refundable credit is not in the cards, because it generates strong opposition from the majority. Another criticism, from a different direction, is that the credit is targeted to a specific income class, and provides taxpayers in that income class with too much of a benefit. I disagree. This is not a novel approach. Many provisions of the tax code are phased out at higher income levels, as a way of targeting benefits and reducing the revenue loss. 
   Another thing. By targeting lower and moderate income workers, the credit provides balance. The benefits of the other provisions of the bill go primarily to higher-paid workers. After all, if we increase the amount that can be deferred in a 401(k) plan more from $10,000 to $15,000 a year, we are only benefiting folks who can afford to make that much of a contribution. So a credit targeted to low and moderate income workers provides the overall bill with balance. 
   In conclusion, I urge the leadership, on the tax-writing committees, in the Senate, in the House, and in the administration, to work together to secure passage of this important legislation. We continue to have a rip-roaring national economy. But many people have been left behind, good people, who are working hard to make ends meet. Let us reach out to them. Let us make an effort to give every working person in this country a real stake in the American dream. Maybe some young worker will see this tax credit and start to put away a little money that he or she otherwise would have spent. That money will compound, and so will the virtue of thrift. And that, Mr. President, will be good for all of us.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when we finally vote on the Agriculture appropriations conference report, I intend to vote for it essentially because the bill provides so much that helps so many people, many of whom are in dire straits. I am referring specifically to a lot of the people living and working in farm communities in my State of Montana and throughout the Nation. 
   I am especially pleased the bill provides $3.6 billion for weather-related disasters. The droughts and fires in my State, as well as other parts of the Nation, have been quite severe and, in many areas, devastating. This bill will help our citizens get through the most difficult times. I commend the Senator from Mississippi and others who have worked to help pass this bill. 
   I want to mention a couple of points of this bill which I think are erroneous. I object strenuously to the provisions in the bill with respect to restrictions on food and medicine sales to Cuba and restrictions on the right of American citizens to travel to Cuba. 
   Last July, I flew to Havana, along with my colleagues, Senator ROBERTS and Senator AKAKA. It was a brief trip, but I returned from Havana more convinced than ever that it was time to end our outdated cold war policy toward Cuba. For example, I believe we should have normal trade relations with Cuba. We do not. The President just a day ago signed permanent normal trade relations with China, a Communist country which certainly presents more of a national security threat to the United States than Cuba, but yet we do not have normal trade relations with Cuba. It makes no sense. 
   As a consequence, we Americans, the Congress, and the Federal Government, prevent our farmers and ranchers from exporting their products to Cuba. But our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors have no constraints. They fill the gap. The result, obviously, is it helps those countries, it helps the Cubans, but it hurts Americans. Also, our policy has no impact on those Cuban policies that we would like to see changed--none whatsoever. 
   Most Members in the Senate and House have also recognized the absurdity of this policy. Earlier this year, the Senate and the House agreed to end the ban on food and medicine sales to Cuba. We had overwhelming majorities in the Senate and the House. Those votes expressed the will of the Congress. The votes clearly reflected the will of the American people. 
   Yet the Republican conferees simply overturned those House and Senate votes. The Republican conferees thwarted the will of the American people. The result is that there will be restrictions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. These restrictions guarantee that there will be few such sales, and those few that do occur will be done only by major companies, shutting out the small farmer. That is not the way law is supposed to be made in a democracy. 
   To rub salt in the wounds, the Republican conferees agreed to codify in law the current administrative restrictions on travel to Cuba. That action removed the flexibility of this President and future Presidents to liberalize or not to liberalize, depending upon what seems to make the most sense. The result is a further infringement on the right of Americans to travel freely. It also diminishes the right of Cuban 
   Americans to visit family members in Cuba. 
   An overwhelming majority of the Congress recognizes we must end the anachronistic cold war policy toward Cuba. That policy harms the average Cuban. Clearly, it harms the average American. The current policy against Castro is a foil. It helps prop him up. Were we to lift the bans that would take away that foil, it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power. It is amazing how foolhardy our policy is. It is also a policy that hurts the American public. It is a great danger. 
   Once the resistance of the Castro regime begins--think of that for a minute. We have to think very carefully about how to help manage the transition that occurs in Cuba from the current-Castro regime to the post-Castro regime. Of course, the Cubans must make that decision. The nature of that transition has a very direct bearing upon this country. We have to be very careful. 
   Clearly, if we were to open up now, we could help influence a transition that is more in America's national interest. Current policy also clearly abridges the freedoms of Americans to travel. If we had to vote separately on these Cuban provisions, I would work hard to defeat them, but the other provisions in the bill are so overwhelming important for the health and prosperity of Americans that I will vote in favor of the Agriculture appropriations bill. But I repeat, the Cuba provisions are a serious step backward.  
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI--I worked with her on this bill--and also Senator BOXER for offering these amendments. 
   I strongly support Senator BOXER in her efforts to delete these provisions. Not only do they intrude upon the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, they are clearly legislation. Our committee was not consulted. The Appropriations Committee is now writing legislative language in an appropriations bill. It also is very unsound public policy. 
   One of these riders, the so-called Linder-Collins provision, is really an attack on the public's right to know. The provision prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency from identifying those areas which do not the meet the 8-hour standard ozone pollution provision until next June. In other words, even if the EPA knew an area had unhealthy air, it could not tell citizens or their government. 
   Since my time is so limited, I will not speak more on that issue. Senator BOXER will, and I believe other Senators will, too. 
   I also want to speak a bit on the other one, and that is the arsenic provision. The other rider postpones EPA's final rules on arsenic standards for drinking water for 6 months. This is very important. This is yet another unhealthy delay that could expose Americans to unnecessary danger. Why do I say that? First, arsenic is a poison. We now know it is also a carcinogen. So it is an especially serious contaminant in drinking water. 
   Get this. The current standard for arsenic was written in 1942, before we knew that arsenic causes cancer. Then, in 1996, Congress completed a comprehensive rewrite of the Safe Drinking Water Act. We put some common sense into the act, some risk assessment, some additional funding for the States. We also put in place a plan to resolve the remaining scientific issues. 
   As a result of the scientific study done by the National Academy of Sciences, we learned that arsenic is even more deadly than previously thought. NAS found:  
   There is sufficient evidence from human epidemiological studies ..... that chronic ingestion of inorganic arsenic causes bladder and lung cancer as well as skin cancer.  
   The study also said the current standard should be revised downward ``as promptly as possible.'' 
   Furthermore, when the Environment and Public Works Committee had a hearing on the matter, in response to a question, Dr. Michael Cossett, a member of the NAS group who studied the arsenic issue, said:  
   Our committee specifically in its conclusions felt that the standards should be lowered as promptly as possible.  
   He went on to say that the current standard certainly was not protective of public health. 
   Yet we have this anti-environmental rider. It is further delay in protecting the American public from better arsenic standards. I cannot understand it. I think it is very bad public policy, and I strongly urge Congress to delete these provisions which, if not deleted, are going to cause serious harm to the American public. 
   Mr. President, earlier today we had a discussion about the arsenic rider. I want to assure Mr. BOND and Ms. MIKULSKI that although the minority committee staff was notified about the intention to pursue this rider, they objected to its inclusion. I just want to be sure the RECORD accurately reflects what occurred. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to my friend from California.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to make a point about one provision of the amendment and ask the committee chairman, Senator SMITH, whether he agrees. Section 132 of the bill establishes a new position, in the Fish and Wildlife Service, of Assistant Director for Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs. The provision also specifies the Assistant Director's responsibilities. 
   Although this provision is similar to section 302 of the version of the bill that passed the House, it differs in one significant respect. The House report said that ``individuals in the Regional offices who are responsible for administering the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs will also report to the Assistant Director.'' We considered and rejected this approach. The Fish and Wildlife Service operates through a system of regional offices. Employees in the regional offices report to the regional directors, and the regional directors report to the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. In light of this, it would be potentially disruptive to require that individuals who are responsible for administering the federal aid program to report directly to the Assistant Director, in Washington, D.C., rather than to the regional director. We do not intend section 132 to mandate such a change. Does the chairman agree?

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support H.R. 3671, the Wildlife Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, and the substitute amendment proposed by the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator SMITH. 
   The Federal aid program, embodied in the Pittman-Robertson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act, uses the revenue derived from the excise taxes on firearms and fishing equipment to support state efforts to promote wildlife conservation, sport fish conservation, hunter education, and related activities. It's a good program. It has provided more than $7 billion to support state wildlife conservation and sport fish projects. To give you a more specific idea about the benefits of the program, in 1999 Montana received almost $5 million dollars under these programs, for activities ranging from our hunter education program, to improving habitat for white tail deer, waterfowl, and upland birds, to acquisition of access rights to private land, to our program to reduce conflicts between grizzly bears and people. A few years ago, the program helped us complete the Gallatin land exchange. 
   Over the years, problems developed in the administration of the program. In particular, the General Accounting Office and others found that money that was set aside, by statute, for administration of the program was being used for unrelated activities. There also were considerable problems with budgeting and overall management. 
   The bill is designed to address these problems. It makes several reforms. Among other things, it reduces the amount available for administrative expenses, clarifies what constitutes a proper administrative expense, and establishes a new multistate grant program, in part, codifying a previous practice. 
   These reforms are important. They will assure that taxpayers' money is well spent and that states receive the funds that they are entitled to. In addition, both the bill reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee and the substitute amendment improve on the version of the bill that passed the House. The bill and amendment provide a level of funding for administration that, while significantly lower than the previous level, will fully fund the current activities of the federal aid office of the Fish and Wildlife Service. They also provide the Service with some limited flexibility in determining what is an appropriate administrative expense and avoid prescribing the Service's activities in such detail that we risk ``micromanaging.'' These changes make a good bill even better. 
   I am pleased that the bill also includes two other important provisions, one reauthorizing the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and another establishing a program to recognize the upcoming centennial of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Both have previously passed the Senate.  
   I urge adoption of the amendment and passage of the bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish we were here on the Senate floor discussing and debating the important issues that are in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I strenuously object to the fact that we are not doing just that. This bill will not be debated on the floor today, or probably any day this session. In fact, we will likely have no opportunity to debate this bill, to offer amendments, or to vote on it. The plan is to wrap it up in an omnibus bill of some sort as the session ends. 
   This is no way to legislate. This is no way to lead. This goes against the very basis of what our country is about. Our Government is based on principles of transparency and openness. Our processes are supposed to be open to public scrutiny and comment. 
   Robert Hutchins, former President of the University of Chicago and one of the most esteemed American intellectuals of the 20th century, wrote:  
   The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush. It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, and undernourishment.  
   Senators have been disenfranchised because of a distorted legislative process. And that means the American citizens who sent us to represent them have also been disenfranchised. I object to how this Congress is being run. 
   There are many important issues that should be of concern to Senators in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I will take a few moments today to address one of those issues. It needs public vetting, even if we are being deprived of our rights to debate it and vote on it. 
   The issue is TV Marti. This is a television station owned and operated by the U.S. Government. It broadcasts daily to Cuba. For more than a decade we beamed TV signals to Havana. The problem is that no one watches TV Marti. No one. And under this appropriations bill, we will spend another $9.5 million next year on a television station that no one watches. Let me explain. 
   The creation of TV Marti and Radio Marti was a good idea conceptually. With no freedom in Cuba, the United States Government would beam into Cuba uncensored news about the world and about what was really going on inside Cuba. The Cuban people, deprived of their freedoms, would have a source of news. 
   What has TV Marti accomplished since its creation in 1989? Has it penetrated the Cuban television market and provided the Cuban people with information that Castro wants to hide from them? The answer is a resounding no. Virtually nobody in Cuba has even heard of TV Marti. According to research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the agency that runs TV Marti, 9 out of 10 Cubans don't even know it exists. 
   The same research by the Broadcasting Board of Governors asked over 1,000 adults whether they had watched TV Marti in the past week. The answer was no one had watched. Not a single person. How many had watched TV Marti in the past year? One. One person out of a thousand. 
   Most Cubans watch television. None watches TV Marti. There are two major reasons. 
   First, TV Marti is on the air when Cubans are asleep. It broadcasts only from 3:30 in the morning until 8:00 A.M. TV Marti has to respect international broadcast rules which require that it not interfere with Cuban TV transmissions. So TV Marti can broadcast only when no Cuban station wants to use the same frequency. That is, it broadcasts when nobody watches television. 
   Second, there is nothing to see. It is just snow on the screen. The Cuban government has effectively jammed the video portion of TV Marti since its inception. 
   So, for $9.5 million in the coming fiscal year, $139 million over the last decade, another $100 million over the next decade, we ask Cubans to get up in the middle of the night to watch snow on a blank screen. This makes no sense at all. 
   Last year, some changes were made in TV Marti, although they are not likely to result in Cuban citizens watching. 
   Defenders of TV Marti contend that it is a long-term investment. They say that someday Fidel Castro will be gone. When that happens, we will want to get accurate information to the Cuban people. Defenders of TV Marti claim that we will save money by having TV Marti up and running at that point. 
   I don't buy this argument. So far we have spent $139 million to have TV Marti in place in case Castro suddenly leaves the scene. At the rate of spending in this appropriations bill, we will spend more than $100 million over the coming decade. That is, total spending of a quarter of a billion dollars for a contingency when Radio Marti is already operating and can get information to Cuban citizens. Is this cost effective? Hardly.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a matter that has impacted every inhabitant of the state of Montana: The wildfires of the past 2 months. The recent rain and snow have finally brought the fires in Montana under control, but many of the largest fires are still smoldering. 
   The Helena Independent Record Recently described the summer of 2000 as a:  
   Fire season marked by miracles and loss, heroism and heartache, smoky skies and blackened backyards, of evacuations, waiting, planning and prayer.  
   This photo showing two elk trying to escape the flames was taken on August 6th in the Bitterroot Valley by Forest Service firefighter John McColgan. On this particular day several forest fires converged near Sula, burning over 100,000 acres and destroying 10 homes. And this fire was just one of dozens burning across Montana. 
   Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that these fires impacted every inhabitant of Montana. Even people in our cities, miles from the front lines, lived with a constant reminder of the conflagration burning about them. 
   As you can see in this photo of Helena, cities all across the region spent weeks under a cloud of smoke. 
   Clearly, it was one of the worst fire seasons we've seen in the last 100 years. 
   This is our cathedral, Saint Helena's Cathedral. You can see big smoke columns rising. The fact is, this is dramatically an understatement. I have asked my office to see if there are other photos which more accurately describe the situation in my State, and this is all we could come up with at the time. But this town, Helena, I might say, was so covered with smoke that my house--up just about 500, 600 feet from here--as I was looking across the back alley through the kitchen window, I could not even see across the alley. The whole city was just covered all the way down to ground level with smoke. That was the rule. That was the rule for all Montana cities, with the exception maybe of some of the eastern Montana cities. Most of them had just dense smoke impact for a long time. Clearly one of the worst fire seasons we have seen in over 100 years. 
   But, Mr. President, I didn't come to the floor to talk about how bad the fires were--that's already apparent. Nor did I come down here to talk about forest management policy and what we could have done to lessen the harmful impact of these fires--there will be plenty of time to address both topics in the weeks and months to come. 
   Mr. President, I am here today to commend the efforts of the thousands of people who pulled together to do battle with one of Mother Nature's most unforgiving forces. 
   From New Zealand's finest, most experienced firefighters to the Montana volunteers who ran Red Cross evacuee camps, the fires brought together some of the most courageous and hard-working individuals I have ever encountered. 
   Someone once told me that the true character of any community will reveal itself in the face of a natural disaster. I am proud of how Montanans and all of those who came to help rose to this challenge and persevered. 
   Of all the statistics--almost a million acres burned, over 300 structures lost, over $200 million spent in battling fires--the one statistic I am most proud of is the number of human casualties--zero. That's right, in Montana not one life was lost during this disaster and no one was seriously injured. 
   I can't tell you how proud I am that safety remained the highest priority: of all of the firefighters who were in harm's way, the pilots who flew risky missions dumping water or retardant chemicals over the fiery landscape, and the thousands of people who were evacuated--no one was seriously injured. To me, that's one heck of a statistic. 
   That's why today, Mr. President, I want to extend a heartfelt ``thank you,'' and I know I speak for every Montanan. 
   I want to thank firefighters from across the country, and around the world. Volunteer firefighters who left their regular jobs. The employees who let them go. Students who postponed attending classes. The families left at home and the co-workers who put in overtime to cover for those who traveled to the west. 
   I might say in this photo, in the center is James Lee Witt, flanked by two members of the Montana delegation, myself on the left, and Senator BURNS on the right. We are talking to a volunteer firefighter. 
   These are people who, when the fire comes, often are in an area next to a community--there are homes back in the woods and the volunteer fighters immediately rush out. They are the first ones there. They are there without any pay. It is their community and they are fighting their hearts out. They are bleeding, almost literally--doing all they can to prevent that structure from burning, to do all they can to force the fire back. They are not paid. It is without compensation. The Forest Service and smokejumpers are; there are others who are not paid. The others are not. They are the first there and often the last to leave. They are just into it because it is their community. 
   I called James Lee Witt, pictured in the center of this photo. He very quickly got some regulations changed so volunteer firefighters could be reimbursed. Recently now they are receiving payment for the services they rendered. But the point is, people came from all over. Employers let volunteers leave work--it was lost work, but still the main job had to be done fighting these fires. Students postponed attending classes at the University of Montana, or other classes, families left at home, coworkers who put in overtime to cover those who traveled to the West. 
   The Red Cross and its hundreds of volunteers who were there when folks needed to see a friendly face. The various state agencies that worked diligently and expeditiously to implement emergency plans. The federal agencies that came forward to help put the fires out and begin to rebuild these communities. 
   Specifically, I'd like to commend FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency for their efforts. On several occasions, they quickly released federal funds or waived personnel requirements. Cutting red tape so we could get the assistance we needed right away. 
   I especially thank FEMA Director James Lee Witt who spent countless hours working with me and other folks in Montana. When these fires started to blow in Montana, James Lee Witt said he was really booked up with other plans, but he dramatically changed his schedule so he could come to Montana. That made a huge difference in getting agencies to work together, and it cut so much of this redtape. FEMA is still working on recovery efforts, and we very much appreciate all they have done and continue to do. 
   I also thank with the same enthusiasm the adjutant general of the Montana National Guard, Gene Prendergast, and all his troops. Gene really stepped up. This guy really cares. He mobilized his troops, who care just as much. He was also influential in working with Federal, State, and local agencies to coordinate plans and requests for Federal assistance. We owe Gene Prendergast a huge debt of gratitude. 
   At the high point of the fires, there were well over 12,000 people fighting blazes in western Montana. That includes Forest Service firefighters and  National Guard men and women. We had 3 active-duty battalions from the East coming to fight fires in Montana. People came from everywhere--from 48 States and 3 countries--to Montana. Across the West, some 30,000 brave individuals battled wildfires during this season. 
   We did not lose any lives in our State, thanks to the combination of solid training, sensible fire strategy, and good luck. The dangers faced by these individuals, however, were obviously real. Think of the danger we put people into. 
   Last year, we took time to remember the Mann Gulch fire. That was a huge fire in Montana which blew up about 50 years ago. Thirteen National Forest Service smoke jumpers died in that blowup. They were fighting a fire 10 miles away from Helena, 10 miles from the photo I showed earlier. It was not thought to be a fire that was going to threaten lives or property. An observer described the Mann Gulch fire with these words:  
   A terrific draft of superheated air of tremendous velocity had swept up the hill exploding all inflammable material, causing a wall of flame 600 feet high to roll over the ridge and down the other side and continue over ridges and down gulches until the fuels were so light that the wall could not maintain enough heat to continue. This wall covered 3,000 acres in 10 minutes. Anything caught in the direct path of the heat blast perished.  
   Just 6 years ago, we lost 14 smoke jumpers in a similar firestorm near Glenwood Springs, CO. This fire, like the Mann Gulch, was considered routine, and these were not even the most deadly fires in the West's history. It is important to remember those who gave their lives fighting wildfires. It is also important to celebrate those who put their lives on the line day after day to keep our homes and communities safe. 
   A simple thank you does not seem to be enough to show our appreciation for these people and for everything they have done. That is why I have come to the floor to announce I am introducing legislation to honor and commemorate the selfless sacrifices each of these individuals has made to keep our families and our homes safe. 
   The legislation will direct the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Department of Defense to work together to create a commemorative pin or badge that will be issued to each firefighter at the end of a fire season. This will serve as an 
   emblem of the vital service they have provided and a symbol of our gratitude, much as a soldier might receive a band to record a tour of duty, because those who fight wildfires really are soldiers who put their lives on the line every day in defense of the people, communities, the lands of America. These courageous men and women need to be recognized as the heroes they are. 
   As we properly focus on the work these brave firefighters do for us, let us not forget the work we must do for them, for it is only by creating and funding sensible forest management policy and by guiding development to reduce the risk to homes and property posed by wildfires that we can keep more of our firefighters out of harm's way and prevent future tragedies like Mann Gulch. 
   As we commemorate our firefighters, let us make sure we rise to the task of putting aside our differences and working together for commonsense policies that will keep our forests healthy and firefighters safe. 
   Again, I say thank you, thank you to all the heroes--firefighters, volunteers, Government employees, ordinary citizens--who pulled together to protect life and home in Montana and across the West. Please know that we are truly grateful for everything you have done.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not have first hand knowledge of the situation, but it is troubling to hear of U.S. businesses running into such difficulties. I read the written statement that the U.S. sponsor of this project submitted to the Senate Finance Committee last spring. 
   Two things struck me. One is that the mediator split the difference. He split the difference between the price for electricity proposed by the Tangshan pricing bureau and the minimum price that the U.S. developer of the project said it needed in order to avoid defaulting on the project debt. The other thing that struck me is, although this was no great result for the U.S. developer, all the developer is seeking at this point is to have the mediator's recommendation implemented. 
   I would like to read a paragraph from the statement that the U.S. sponsor of the project submitted to the Senate Finance Committee. This is the president of the company speaking. ``I am not here to ask you or your colleagues to grant or deny China PNTR status. I am here to relate a story of how one U.S. company fared when it tried to supply electricity to the Chinese. Unfortunately, we have come to find that our experience is not all that uncommon. However, in our case, the consequences are potentially disastrous because Panda had to guarantee the U.S. bondholders that they would be repaid. We feel like the jilted bride who entered into a marriage five years ago with the Chinese only to find them trying to walk away from the marriage now that the child has been born. This isn't fair.'' 
   I agree, and I yield the Floor to the Democratic Leader.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator SMITH, on behalf of Senator VOINOVICH, myself and others is introducing the Environmental Streamlining Improvement Act. 
   This bill ensures that the United States Department of Transportation will issue a revised rule on TEA-21 environmental streamlining regulations. This bill will give the USDOT another chance to follow the statute when issuing proposed rules on planning and the environment. 
   The Environment and Public Works Committee has held three hearings on the subject of environmental streamlining since the passage of TEA-21 in 1998. I am sorry to say that in the 2 years it has taken the USDOT to issue this NPRM, they fall far short of what Congress has intended. TEA-21 is very specific about what the regulations should do. The proposed regulations follow neither the word nor the intent of TEA-21. 
   I remember working with Senators WARNER, GRAHAM, WYDEN and CHAFEE and with the House members to develop an agreement on environmental streamlining. Those provisions are now Sections 1308 and 1309 of TEA-21. 
   I had heard from the Montana Department of Transportation and from others about how cumbersome a process it is to complete a highway project. Everyone who worked on TEA-21, in both the House and Senate, wanted to include a direction to the USDOT to streamline the planning and project development processes for the states. 
   We were very clear--the environment and the environmental reviews should not get short shrift! But, we need to find a way to make it easier to get a final decision, eliminate unnecessary delays, move faster and with as little paperwork as possible. 
   I cannot over-emphasize that the planning and environmental provisions of TEA-21 need to be implemented in a way that will streamline the expedite, not complicate, the process of delivering transportation projects. 
   That is why Congress directed the USDOT to include certain elements in their regulations on environmental streamlining. 
   We included concepts to be incorporated in future regulations--like concurrent environmental reviews by agencies and reasonable deadlines for the agencies to follow when completing their reviews. 
   Certainly we did not legislate an easy task to the USDOT. Trying to coordinate so many separate agencies is like trying to herd cats. The whole concept of environmental streamlining--that is, to make the permit and approval process work more smoothly and effectively, while still ensuring protection of the environment--is one of the more difficult challenges of TEA-21. 
   So I waited for the rules to come out. And waited. And two years after the passage of TEA-21 I look at the proposed rules and I am very disappointed. 
   I have identified several problems with these regulations and I would like to mention just a few things that I see as real problems. 
   First, elevating the planning process participants to the roles of decision makers. These regulations were supposed to help the States get their jobs done better and more efficiently. Its one thing to add more participants to the process. More involvement is a good thing. 
   But its another thing to give them the authority to make decisions about how the planning process will work. This decision maker role is currently held by State DOTs and Metropolitan Planning Organizations for a reason. 
   Second, what happened to ``streamlining?'' The basic elements of real streamlining are the only things not in the regs. 
   Third, these regulations are supposed to answer questions--but what is contained in the proposed regulations raises even more questions because they are vague there they need to be precise. 
   Fourth, this proposal makes it even harder, if not impossible to come to a decision. These regulations include initiatives not outlined in sections 1308 and 1309 and in many areas would strip states of their authority. 
   I would also like to mention that the Montana Department of Transportation filed comments or wrote letters at every possible opportunity for the public record. As I read these proposed regulations, I see that MDT's comments were either never read by the USDOT or ignored. 
   Let me close by saying that I believe the proposed rules would add significant requirements and uncertainty to planning and environmental review for transportation projects. In practical terms, they would increase overhead and delay--and delay usually means increased project costs. These proposed rules could make it difficult for States to deliver their programs. Contracts won't get let and jobs will be lost. 
   I know this is a tough task. To streamline a process while ensuring that we maintain a thorough planning and environmental review process. But, adding requirements to the process is contrary to the course charted by Congress. 
   At our last hearing, the administration testified that their intent was to streamline the process. The bill we are introducing today would allow them to make good on their intent. 
   Our bill requires the USDOT go back to the drawing board and incorporate  comments received from States and others and issue another NPRM. I am confident the USDOT will do the right thing this time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against adoption of the Conference Report for the Energy and Water Appropriations. Section 103 is an anti-environmental rider that prevents the sound management of the Missouri River. 
   As my colleagues will recall, during Senate consideration of this bill last month, Senator DASCHLE and I proposed to delete this provision. Unfortunately we were not successful. 
   Now, rather than attempting to work out a compromise, the conferees have included the very same language in the conference report before us tonight. 
   I will not repeat all of the arguments made in the earlier debate about why this amendment is bad for the river and the people of my state. The important point is, nothing has changed from that debate and the need to remove this rider remains as true today as it did then. 
   First, the Army Corps of Engineers is managing the Missouri River on the basis of a master manual that was written in 1960 and hasn't changed much since then. 
   Today, conditions are much different. Priorities are different. 
   Under the current master manual--40 years old--water levels in Ft. Peck lake are often drawn down in the summer months, largely to support barge traffic downstream, which is an industry that is dying and, according to the Corps' own analysis, has much less economic value than the recreation value upstream. 
   These drawdowns have occurred time and time again. Their effect is devastating: Moving ramps to put boats in the lake a mile away, severely curtail boating and fishing that are enjoyed by thousands of Montanans and tourists alike. They also reduce the numbers of walleye, sturgeon, and other fish. 
   The drawdowns are the big reason why eastern Montana has been getting an economic raw deal for years. More balanced management of the Missouri River, which takes better account of upstream economic benefits, is absolutely critical to reviving the economy in that part of our State. 
   Now there has been some talk that the proposed split season will affect hydropower production. While detailed studies are not yet complete, in fact, the Corps estimates that the split season will have ``essentially no impact to the total hydropower benefits.'' So there really should be no doubt. The split season is a better deal for Montana. It is a better deal for the whole river. 
   Of course, this rider is about more than just Ft. Peck. 
   It also prevents the Corps of Engineers from obeying the law of the land. Specifically, the Endangered Species Act. 
   If we create a loophole here, there will be pressure to create another loophole somewhere else. And then another. Before you know it, the law will be shredded into tatters. 
   We all know the Endangered Species Act is not perfect. I believe we need to reform it so it will work better for landowners and for species. 
   We are working hard to pass returns, but those reforms haven't passed. So the Endangered Species Act remains the law of the land, and we have to respect it. And so should the Corps. 
   Forget about the species for a minute. Think about basic fairness. We require private landowners to comply with the Endangered Species Act. 
   Why should the Federal Government get a free pass? 
   The answer is, they should not. The Army Corps of Engineers should be held to the same standard as everybody else, and the Corps agrees. 
   We have a public process in place, to carefully revise the master manual. It's been underway for 10 years. 
   Now, at the last minute, when the end is in sight, a rider in an appropriations bill would derail the process by taking one of the alternatives right off the table. 
   That's not fair. It's not right. It's not the way we ought to make this decision. 
   Instead, we should give the open process that we began ten years ago a chance to work. 
   We should give people an opportunity to comment on the biological opinion and the environmental impact statement. 
   So the final decision will not be made in a vacuum. 
   But this rider makes a mockery of that process. The rider allows for an extensive period for public comment. But then it prohibits the public agencies from acting on those comments. 
   A better way is to allow the agencies and the affected parties to continue to work together to strike a balance to manage this mighty and beautiful river: for upstream states, for downstream states, and for the protection of endangered species; that is, for all of us.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bill which will provide long-overdue compensation to agricultural producers in my state and across the country. The ``Wheat Protein Mismeasurement Compensation Act'' provides a legislative remedy for producers who suffered a loss due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's erroneous underestimation of their wheat protein content for wheat sold between May 2, 1993 and January 24, 1994. 
   In May 1993, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Federal Grain Inspection Service, required the use of new technology for determining the protein content of wheat. However, the calibrations provided by the Secretary for the new protein measurement instruments were erroneous and resulted in protein determinations that were lower than those produced by the technology in use before use of the new technology was required. 
   As a result of this miscalibration and the USDA's failure to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment, hundreds of wheat producers in my state were forced to adjust their protein measurement and pricing system in order to protect themselves on resale. The result was a significant loss of revenue from the sale of high-protein wheat. 
   Mr. President, I have worked on this issue for several years--first as a case for my injured Montana producers. In a perfect this world, this problem would have been resolved by the USDA at an administrative level immediately after the miscalibration was identified and readjusted. Instead, it has lagged on and on and on. Unfortunately this matter for technical sovereign immunity reasons cannot be resolved in the courts. That is why we in Congress are their last chance at getting this resolved once and for all. 
   It is clearly, however, that these wheat producers by no fault of their own were injured by the USDA's implementation of a flawed system. But for that error, they would have received a fair price for their wheat. At a time when the agricultural community continues to suffer from record low prices and disastrous weather conditions, this continued injustice is simply unacceptable. We must do all in our power to correct this problem and justly compensate our producers for their losses. 
   I urge my colleagues to assist us in the expeditious passage of this legislation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, our nation's agricultural heritage is a rich tradition, which encompasses much of what we are about as a people; hard work, common sense, and a deep respect for the land. 
   In Montana, and in too many communities across America, our agricultural heritage is at risk. Productive farms and ranches that have been in the same family for generations are being forced to turn their back on the land they love in order to make ends meet. 
   I applaud our current conservation easement system and the many fine non-profit organizations that have worked with landowners across America to protect millions of acres of land. The successes have been great, but so too have the lessons. 
   What we have learned is that the current system does not work particularly well for working farmers and ranchers. That's why I've introduced the Rural Heritage Conservation Act, a creative approach that provides farmers and ranchers with a real incentive to preserve their, and our, agricultural heritage. 
   Over the past twenty-five years, over 3 million acres of agricultural land have been lost to development in Montana alone. Many of these acres were lost when family farms, hit hard by tough times, chose to give up their generations of old farming operations and sell to developers in order to pay their outstanding debts. 
   The measure proposed in this legislation will expand the current conservation easement tax incentive program with an eye toward making the system work better for the bulk of real, working farmers and ranchers who would like to preserve their land for future generations but for whom the current system does not provide any meaningful incentive. 
   Let me give you a real-life example that was presented by my good friend Jerry Townsend of Highwood Montana before the Senate Finance Committee's subcommittee on Tax and IRS oversight. 
   Mr. Townsend testified that when he gave a conservation easement to the Montana Land Reliance, the value of his deduction was $524,000. However, under current law, over the last five years he has only been able to save $1,858 in federal taxes. Not much of an incentive, particularly when you factor  in the $2,500 he paid for the appraisal required to complete the conservation easement process. 
   The Rural Heritage Conservation Act will do three things. 
   First, it will create a targeted, limited tax credit for farm and ranch filers who donate a conservation easement to a qualified land trust. Mr. Townsend's example is all too familiar a story to farmers and ranchers throughout America. The relatively small deduction they can obtain under current law does not in any way equate to either the potential income they have forfeited or the value the public has gained from the donation. As a result, fewer and fewer farmers and ranchers are donating conservation easements and protecting their land for future generations. 
   To protect against abuse, the bill calls for a cap on the total tax credit available under the program and requires that a majority of the income for the qualifying filer be from farm and ranch operations. 
   Second, this legislation will level the playing field for all types of agricultural filers. Current law allows C-Corps to deduct up to 10 percent of their income compared to the 30% allowed for other business types including Limited Liability Companies, Sole Proprietorships and Limited Liability Partnerships. 
   According to figures presented by the Montana Land Reliance, there are some 40,000 acres of land in Montana alone owned by C-Corporations, in most cases family held, that have identified the 10 percent limit as a barrier to their contributing an easement. 
   Third, the bill would eliminate the current provision that limits additional estate tax relief to landowners only within a 25 mile radius of a metropolitan area. 
   As we have discussed at some length in this very chamber, estate tax is a significant issue for many Americans, including those who live in farm and ranch households. The current radius restriction works to the financial disadvantage of people who live in states with sparse populations. 
   Elimination of the radius will be a significant improvement to current law and will enable many rural families to pass along to future generations family farms and ranches that are so much a part of the very heart of America. 
   Protecting our agricultural heritage and the land that makes it possible is good public policy. I believe that the Agricultural Heritage Preservation Act is a creative, common sense approach to improving the current conservation easement program and making it work better to meet this important goal. I'm not claiming that this approach is the ``perfect'' approach, or the only way to accomplish our goals. But it's clear that the current system does not work effectively for small farmers and ranchers and we must do more. I hope that the introduction of this bill will initiate an informed, intelligent discussion of this important matter. We must find the best way to solve this problem that threatens the conservation of our agricultural lands and rural way of life. 
   I hope that as we consider other land conservation initiatives and other measures to make significant changes to the estate tax system, that the changes I'm proposing in the Rural Heritage Conservation Act will be a key part of the discussion.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native American Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement Act, the NATIVE Act. This bill provides a low interest loan program to build telecommunications infrastructure for federally-recognized Indian tribes. 
   This legislation is timely. This week the Federal Communications Commission is hosting an Indian Telecom Training Initiative in St. Paul Minnesota to provide training to tribes on all phases of providing telecommunications services to their members. Why is this so important? 
   At a time when 94 percent of Americans enjoy basic telephone service and the benefits derived thereof, only 47 percent of Native Americans on reservations have service. This is even below the rate of the rural homes, 91 percent. 
   Indian and Alaska Native people live in some of the most geographically remote areas of the country. Most Alaska Native villages are reachable year-round by air only, have limited access by water, and have no road connections. On the mainland, many Indian reservations are located west of the Mississippi, where the wide-open spaces often mean that the nearest town, city, or hospital is several hours away by car. 
   Those that do not have a telephone do not have access to some of the basic services that we take for granted each and every day. 
   Some cannot obtain access to medical care in an emergency. Others cannot reach prospective employers quickly and easily. Many cannot take advantage of the commercial, educational, and medical care opportunities the Internet offers. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples: 
   Raymond Gachupin, governor of Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, said he once was unable to call for emergency help for a young man who had been shot because no phone was available. 
   William Kennard at an FCC Field Hearing in 1999 revealed a case on the Navaho reservation in Arizona, where 1,500 school children have computers, but can't hook up to the Internet because the Information Superhighway seems to have passed them by. 
   And then there is just the basic inconvenience of not having a readily available means of communication: 
   The community of Bylas in Arizona, which has approximately 2,000 residents, had only one payphone. People would line up at 6 o'clock in the morning to use the phone. They would stand in line sometimes until 12 o'clock midnight to use the phone. The only other way to talk to people was if you saw them in town and then any news may be days old. 
   I know these stories are from the Southwestern United States but in my home state of Montana many of the reservations lack phone service, over 60 percent of the homes on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, 55 percent on the Crow Reservation. 
   The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up to the plate to help solve this problem by reducing the cost of basic telephone service for individuals on reservations through the Lifeline and Linkup programs. The lifeline program could reduce the monthly cost of phone service to one dollar, all eligible customers would see bills below $10. The Linkup program helps offset the cost of the initiating service by as much as $100. 
   As stated earlier, this week in St. Paul Minnesota, the FCC is conducting a training seminar for tribal telecommunications. 
   I commend the FCC for their efforts and want to assist where I can. That is why I am introducing this valuable legislation. 
   The infrastructure costs for providing telecommunications services can be very high especially in remote areas where customers can be more than one mile apart. This legislation will help to keep those costs down by lowering the cost of borrowing. 
   The NATIVE Act provides a $1 billion revolving loan fund with a graduated interest rate pegged to the per capita income of the population receiving service. The interest rates range from 2 percent for the poorest tribes up to 5 percent. 
   The plans submitted for loan approval will be subject to the requirements of current Rural Utilities Service borrowers including service capable of transmitting data at a minimum rate of one Megabit per second. This will ensure the system in place will connect Native Americans to the Internet thereby opening up economic opportunities that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
   The program is not intended to displace existing telecommunications carriers who are providing service to Native Americans. In fact, the bill is specific in that loan funds can only be used to provide service to unserved and underserved areas, where existing service is deemed inadequate due to either cost or quality. 
   Additionally the Act establishes a matching grant program for conducting feasibility studies to determine the best alternative for providing service. 
   The program will be administered by the Rural Utilities Service, an agency with over 50 years experience in lending for rural telecommunications infrastructure throughout the country. 
   The RUS telecommunications program has provided financing for 866,000 miles of line approximately one-tenth of which is fiber optic, serving 5.5 million customers, including Native Americans. The RUS distance learning/telemedicine program has funded 306 projects for rural schools and medical centers in 44 states since its inception in 1993 bringing improved services for education and health care centers in rural communities. All without incurring any loan losses. 
   I have the utmost confidence that the Rural Utilities Service will successfully administer this program. 
   To wrap up, Mr. President, I know that we cannot reach everyone. There are some who simply do not want service in order to preserve their traditional way of living and others who feel owning a telephone is not a priority within the household budget; however, we should strive to try to ensure telecommunications service to those who want and need to have a telephone. 
   Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. WARNER, and Mr. ROBB):

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my good friend, Senator SMITH, for his comments. 
   I join him in urging my colleagues to support final passage of the legislation before us. 
   As we stated on the floor last week, this important bill authorizes projects for flood control, navigation, shore protection, environmental restoration, water supply storage, and recreation. All very important matters across the country. These projects often don't get headlines or much attention, but they clearly mean a lot to many people. 
   Each of these projects meet our committee criteria. That is important, too, because the Environment and Public Works Committee gets lots of requests. The projects are technologically feasible, economically justified, and environmentally sound. In addition, each project has a local sponsor willing to share a portion of the cost, which is something we insist upon in order to show that the project is important locally. 
   Passage of this bill will advance two projects that are very important for my State of Montana--the fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake and the exchange of cabin site leases in the C.M. Russell Wildlife Refuge. 
   The fish hatchery is particularly important since it will create more jobs and help our State's economy in northeastern Montana, a part of the State which is, frankly, hurting. 
   The cabin lease exchange provision will also benefit the government, sportsmen, and cabin site owners by acquiring inholdings that are within the refuge and that have high value for wildlife in return for cabin sites now managed by the Corps. 
   Finally, this bill will start us on the path to restoration of that unique national treasure known as the Everglades. 
   Last week we heard my colleagues from Florida, as well as the leaders of  the Environment and Public Works Committee elaborate on the importance of this effort. We all know how important it is. It is one of our natural treasures. 
   This provision is a testament to true bipartisanship. Senators GRAHAM and MACK have been at the forefront of this effort. Governor Jeb Bush and the Clinton administration, particularly Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, have also worked closely to achieve this result. 
   And, of course, it could not have happened without the support of Senator SMITH, our chairman, who put this issue at the top of the committee's agenda this year and has worked tirelessly throughout the year to make this bill happen, and Senator, VOINOVICH, the subcommittee chairman. This has been an effort of his as well. 
   Without this bipartisan support in Washington, and throughout Florida, this project would not be where it is today. It would still be on the drawing board. And the Everglades would still be destined to die. 
   In conclusion, I want to assure our colleagues that this bill is the right thing to do. And it is worthy of their support.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to honor a great Montanan, a great American, who passed away just a few days ago, Maureen Hayes Mansfield. 
   These are remarks about Maureen, but it is also a love story. Maureen was born Maureen Hayes in the State of Washington at the beginning of the last century, in 1905, and spent most of her youth in Butte, MT. Butte, at that time, was a live, bustling, raucous mining city, with big copper mines. Living in Butte, she met a grade school dropout, a mucker working in the Butte mines, a profound young man named Mike--Mike Mansfield. 
   Mike was not only a grade school dropout but he also was an extremely wonderful person. Maureen must have recognized the strength in Mike at the time. Mike, as many of us know, served in all three branches of the armed services--age 17, 18, and 19. He had to maybe tell a little story about his age so he could get into--I think it was the Navy at the time. 
   Mike served, and Maureen noticed that. They became very close--they fell in love with each other, Mike living as a solitary boarder in a boarding house, Maureen living up in a nice spacious house with her large family in Butte. After they got to know each other even more, Maureen, who was a high school teacher in Butte, persuaded Mike to go back to school. She persuaded Mike to leave the mines, go back to school and get an education. 
   A few years later, they moved to Missoula, MT. In Missoula, Maureen quit her job. She cashed in her life insurance policy to support Mike's education so Mike could go back and get a university degree. 
   Mike gradually worked his way up and became a professor in history at the University of Montana. He got his master's degree at the University of Montana. And Maureen, in the year Mike got his master's in history, got hers in English, writing a thesis on Emily Bronte. Mike's thesis was on U.S.-Korea diplomatic relations. 
   Maureen persuaded Mike to run for Congress in 1940. It was the Western District in Montana. Mike was unsuccessful. It, ironically, is the same district that Jeannette Rankin, a very strong woman, held for a couple of terms. It is a district I once represented, and Lee Metcalf and other Montanans of great note have held. 
   Mike finally won in 1942. He came to Washington on a train --he did not take one of these jets; it was on a train, to Washington, DC--and set up his office. Maureen worked in his office without compensation. 
   They worked together; they were such a wonderful team. Mike then, after 10 years in the House, served 10 years in the Senate beginning in 1952. Years after his service in the House, he was elected majority leader of the Senate. He served 16 years, longer than any other American, as majority leader of the Senate. Then Mike, as we know, went off to serve as Ambassador to Japan under both President Carter and President Reagan. 
   This is a story probably about Mike Mansfield, but Maureen's death is time for us to reflect upon Maureen herself and upon the love that Mike and Maureen had for each other. They were inseparable. They were always together, always giving each other support, help, and confidence as a team. 
   I can remember when I met Mike. The majority leader's office at that time was a little more modest than it is today. Maureen was sitting in there, and they were talking a little bit. Right away I realized Mike and Maureen just did not have all the time  they would have liked to have had together because Mike was so busy as majority leader. 
   I said: You two don't get much chance to be together. I am going to leave so you can have some time together. 
   I did. I walked out. I could tell they liked it very much. Maureen's eyes twinkled and smiled. I say this because Maureen always smiled. She was always optimistic, always upbeat, always helping people, always a very kind person, self-effacing, a lady of few words but uncommon talent and knowledge and wisdom. 
   She attended St. Mary's University, a women's college which was then attached to Notre Dame in Indiana. She got her master's degree in English in 4 years, which was quite a feat for women in those years. She read constantly. She was always taking home books from the Library of Congress. 
   I believe if one looks throughout history, very often people who read a lot are wiser, have more confidence in themselves, and have a greater imprint upon other people in a positive way. I am thinking of people such as Harry Truman. He read a lot. Justice Blackmun read a lot, and Maureen was one of those who constantly read and was just a wonderful influence on Mike. 
   Let me give a couple examples to demonstrate just how much Mike believed in Maureen. 
   We all know that Mike never took credit for what he did. Maureen never took credit for all that she did. It was an era, a time when people did not take credit for what they did. They just did a good job. That was in the sixties, seventies, less so in this era. 
   Whenever somebody wanted to credit Mike for his tremendous accomplishments, Mike would always insist: No, Maureen is first. Whatever I did, Mike Mansfield, whatever honors I had is because of Maureen. 
   It is true. Often the people of the State of Montana would say: OK, Mike, we want to dedicate a building to you, the Mansfield Center. 
   Mike would say: No, it has to be the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center, and they would agree. 
   The legislature in Montana wanted to create a statue honoring Mike Mansfield, one of the most famous Montanans in our State's history. ``No way,'' Mike said, ``unless it is a statue of Maureen and myself.'' Otherwise he was very much opposed. The legislature agreed. 
   I wish you could have seen the two of them together. They were always together. They celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary last March. They were married 68 years, solidly helping to reinforce each other. They were always together helping each other. 
   I asked Mike once: Mike, you have lived such a rich life. When are you going to write your memoirs? 
   Mike said: I am not going to. 
   I asked why. 
   He said: I was told so much in confidence, it would not be proper for me to write memoirs. Those are confidential statements. 
   And that is Maureen. The two of them were just like that. I am sure Maureen's influence on Mike helped make Mike the great, wonderful person he is, and it was mutually reinforcing. I also have a view that teachers tend to be more dedicated than most other professions. After all, teachers are servants in a sense. If one looks at achievers, very often one of their parents was a teacher or there was a teacher somewhere in the family. 
   Maureen was a teacher. She was a teacher in the public school system. Mike was a teacher at the University of Montana. The best lessons they taught us were by example: Honest as the day is long; their word is their bond; upbeat, positive, contributing, giving, thinking, searching for a better way for more people. 
   I believe the most noble human endeavor is service--service to community, to church, to family, to friends, to State, whatever makes the most sense for an individual. Maureen Mansfield served her husband, her State, and her country more than any other person I have had the privilege to know or to meet and with such grace, such style, and such inspiration. 
   I stand here today, Mr. President, in great honor of Maureen Mansfield, in awe of the wonderful love affair between Mike and Maureen. As many of Maureen's Indian friends would say: This is not goodbye; we will see you later. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator SMITH, in supporting S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. I will say a few words about the bill and a couple of words about some projects in Montana, and finally wrap up with further comments about the Everglades restoration. 
   This bill authorizes projects for a lot of different areas. It is really quite a sweeping bill: flood control, for one, navigation, shore protection, environmental restoration, water supply storage, and recreation. 
   It also modifies some existing projects and directs the Corps to study other proposed projects. All projects in this bill have the support of a local sponsor, somebody at home willing to share the cost of the project. 
   Even a brief review of the projects will demonstrate the importance of passing this bill. A number of the projects are needed to protect shorelines along oceans, lakes, and rivers. 
   Several of the navigation projects will ensure that our ports remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace. The studies authorized in the bill will help us make informed decisions about the future use and management of our water resources. 
   Each project in this bill has been reviewed by the Army Corps of Engineers and has been found to be in the Federal  interest, technologically feasible, economically justified, and environmentally sound. These projects have also been reviewed in accordance with applicable standards and also with our own committee criteria; in other words, they are worthy of support. 
   Let me mention two that are very important to my State of Montana. First is the authorization for a fish hatchery at Fort Peck. This fish hatchery will make good on a long-awaited promise on the Fort Peck project; namely, to create more opportunities for people in communities like Sidney, Malta, Lewistown, Billings, and, of course, Glasgow, and all across Montana. 
   Fort Peck Lake, one of the greatest resources that exists in our State, not only plays a major role in power production, water supply, but it is an increasingly important center for recreation. Not just for Montanans; people from all around the world--believe me, that is true, all around the world--come to Fort Peck Lake, MT, for our annual walleye tournaments. Hundreds of boats and probably 1,000 or more anglers participate in these events. It is amazing. I was there last summer. It is truly a sight to behold, all these boats taking off for a major national fishing tournament. The local community really puts its heart and soul into these tournaments. 
   Local folks have also collaborated on raising a lot of money for the matching share of the feasibility study for the fish hatchery, from Sidney, Malta, Glasgow, all across northeastern Montana. There are not a lot of people in northeastern Montana, but there is a lot of spirit and spunk and a lot of wide open spaces. 
   Fort Peck Lake is very important to these communities, in some sense it is almost the heart and soul of the northeastern part of our State. So, these communities have come together, they have raised the funds, and they have pitched in to support the fish hatchery project. 
   The State legislature also passed a special warm water fishery stamp to help provide additional financial support for the hatchery. 
   This hatchery will help ensure the continued development of opportunities at Fort Peck Lake, and it will represent a major source of jobs and economic development for that part of our State. 
   Another provision of the bill that affects my State of Montana is the one that affects cabin sites that are leased by private individuals on Federal land at Fort Peck Lake. The lake is huge. It is surrounded by the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, but there are a lot of private in-holdings in this refuge. 
   This provision will allow cabin leases to be exchanged for other private land within the refuge that has higher value for, say, fish, wildlife, and recreation. By consolidating management of the refuge lands, the provision will reduce the cost to the Corps associated with managing these cabin sites. It will also enhance public access to the refuge lands. 
   This exchange is modeled on a similar project, of which I am very proud, near Helena, MT, which Congress authorized in 1998. It represents a win-win-win solution--a win for the public, a win for the wildlife, and a win for the cabin site owners. 
   I also want to mention another landmark provision in this bill referred to at some length by my good friend, Senator SMITH, chairman of the committee. In addition to the usual project authorizations contained in the water resources bill, this bill also affords a historic opportunity. Title 6 of the bill is known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 
   Restoration of the Everglades has been many years in the making. For example, in the 1970s, the State of Florida became concerned that the previously authorized central and south Florida water project was doing too good a job. Why? Because it was draining the swampy areas of the State and was, in fact, draining the life out of the Everglades. 
   Under the leadership of our current colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, who was then Governor GRAHAM, the State recognized that the health of the entire south Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades, was in serious jeopardy and that a major effort was needed to restore it. 
   Ever since, Senator GRAHAM has worked tirelessly to achieve that goal. I can testify to that personally. The comprehensive plan to restore this valuable ecosystem that is contained in the bill before us is the culmination of his work. 
   The Everglades is clearly a national treasure. I know it holds a particularly special place in the hearts of Senator GRAHAM and Senator MACK. Senator MACK joined Senator GRAHAM to make Everglades restoration a key part of their agenda for the State of Florida. Both of them worked very hard in a bipartisan way to make this provision a reality. 
   The administration, under the leadership of the Corps of Engineers and Army Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Joe Westphal, with the cooperation of the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency, are also committed to bringing all the affected parties together to develop a plan that will work for the State of Florida, the ecosystem, and the Everglades. 
   The committee has worked with all the stakeholders in South Florida and with the administration to develop the consensus contained in this bill. There are provisions to review the progress of the plan, to make sure it is working, to require Congress to approve steps along the way, and to assure the water will be where it is needed, when it is needed. 
   We cannot wait for the Everglades to die. We have to begin now to restore it. This project is the largest environmental restoration project in the Corps' history, and it will reverse the decline of the Everglades. It is the right thing to do. I know my colleagues will join us with in supporting this section of the bill and the Water Resources Development bill generally. 
   I have one final point. I pay special commendation to the chairman of our committee, Senator SMITH. The first committee hearing he held as chairman of the committee was in Florida on the Everglades. It was there he saw the need to restore the Everglades, and it was there he made his pledge to the people of Florida, and to the Nation, to restore the Everglades. That is the hallmark of the very balanced, solid, far-reaching, and perceptive way in which he has handled the chairmanship of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   We are here today, in many respects, not only because of the Senators from Florida, Senators GRAHAM and MACK, and others, but also because of Senator SMITH's farsighted work as chairman of the committee. I thank him, as well as the others, for what they have done for a true national treasure.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all want to protect the Everglades. I don't think there is a Senator here who does not want to substantially protect and restore the Everglades. 
   How do we do it? What is the most fair, most equitable way to restore the Everglades? I think it is important to remember we cannot let perfection be the enemy of the good. There is no perfect solution. But there are good solutions. The committee has crafted a good solution. 
   It is true, as the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Ohio are pointing out, we are breaking precedent. It is true. The provisions of the bill do provide for Uncle Sam to pay 50 percent of the operation and maintenance cost of this very large and very important project. That is true. I share many of the concerns of the Senators, the potential slippery slope; what is this going to lead to? Why are we breaking precedent here? It is a 14-year precedent, I think. It has been some time. What is a Federal interest? Sometimes it is hard to define what a Federal interest is. 
   But just as there are more Federal dollars going in for operation and maintenance, on the other side of the equation we are also breaking another precedent; that is, the State is putting up more of the construction costs. Ordinarily the State would have to put up about 35 percent of the construction costs. It is a big project, about $8 billion. Florida has decided to put up the full 50 percent. So they are paying more than they ordinarily would. The U.S. Government will be paying more than it ordinarily would in operation and maintenance costs. 
   This arrangement may not be perfect. But we are dealing with an extraordinary, special situation, and that is the Everglades. All of us in America feel a part of the Everglades. Certainly, the Floridians feel more closely attached to the Everglades, but I think the rest of us in this country have a feeling about it. It is part of America, a special part of America we want to protect and restore as best we can. So I say we should stick with the approach the committee has come up with after a lot of hard work, and a lot of give and take. 
   In addition, I might point out 50 percent of the benefits go to parks, Federal parks, Federal land. There are about 18,000 square miles involved in the Everglades restoration. About 9,000 square miles of that is Federal lands; 9,000 is non-Federal lands. So it seems to me a 50-50 operation and maintenance cost share--it is rough justice. It is about right: 9,000 Federal, 9,000 non-Federal, 50-50; at a time when the State of Florida also is putting up more than its usual share for construction. 
   So this has been a good debate. In future years, when we are faced with similar questions, I know the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Ohio are going to be front and center saying: Uh-oh, here we go again. Remember that time in September 2000? And they will be making good points. But I believe one has to make a decision. The decision is now before us to proceed with the bill and not adopt the amendment offered by my good friend, recognizing they made good points, but I do not agree those points are sufficiently valid to warrant passage of their amendment.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are about to complete the debate on PNTR and are about to take the final vote. It has been a good debate. It has been a time when the American people have had an opportunity to learn more about what PNTR for China actually will be. 
   There are good arguments on all sides, but I am quite happy, frankly, that now we are at the end of this long process, finally the United States will grant permanent normal trade relations to China. We are finally putting that issue to bed, and some side issues, too, have been put off to the side, as important as they are. 
   Many of the issues raised on the Senate floor not directly relevant to PNTR have been very good ones. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights, religion freedom, environment, prison labor, Taiwan-PRC relationship are very important matters that, in some cases, go to the heart of American policy. They are clearly issues that need to be debated and resolved. The United States has a very important stake in all of them.  
   Some of the amendments that have been proposed to PNTR in these last few weeks have been good ones; others, not so good. Fortunately, a majority of my colleagues opposed all amendments to the PNTR bill, even when we agreed with the underlying concerns. Why? Basically because any amendment that would be part of PNTR would be killer amendments due to the very short number of remaining days in this session. Because of Presidential politics, which is engulfing us to some degree, it is much more prudent not to adopt amendments at this time. In 
   the next Congress, we will have an opportunity to deal with these issues. I hope we can deal with them, particularly based on the merits. 
   I want to take a moment to discuss what will happen after the PNTR vote. It is more to remind ourselves that despite the successful conclusion of the debate, when the votes are counted later today, they will not create a single job. Our votes will not sell a single bushel of wheat. Rather, PNTR is an enabler. It is a vital enabler. It enables American businesses and American people to do much more than they can now do. 
   The immediate next step of completion of PNTR is completion of negotiations in Geneva on the Protocol of Accession and the Working Party Report to the WTO General Council. Once China formally accedes--that is, becomes a member of WTO--we Americans will remove China from the restrictions of the Jackson-Vanik legislation. That is when it happens. At that point, the American private sector has to take advantage of the immense new opportunities afforded by China's membership in the WTO. 
   Passage of PNTR will be one for the history books with profound implications for the United States. Once it passes, we Americans have to put our shoulders to the wheel. We have to follow up. American industry has to follow up. The American Government has to follow up in a way that we enable ourselves to maximize potential benefits to our service providers and to our manufacturers. We have to take matters in our own hands. We have to take advantage of this. The same is true for the U.S. Government at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch as well as the legislative branch. We need to watch China and monitor China's compliance to make sure this agreement is implemented. 
   I am reminded of another agreement we had earlier with China --that is the intellectual property rights agreement--because some Chinese firms were pirating America's films, CDs, cassettes, and other intellectual property created in the United States. We finally urged China to pass a law making the pirating of intellectual property illegal in China. China passed the law. The problem is they did not implement it. We had to go back and encourage implementation. We may face the same problems here. I hope not. It is possible. 
   As we move ahead, we must never forget how multifaceted our relationship with China is. That means we must aggressively address the many important issues raised in the PNTR debate. As important as those issues are, they should not be on the bill, but they still indicate the multifaceted nature of our relationship with China. 
   One major area is focusing on our strategic architecture in Asia. Assuring stability in the region, helping maintain peace and prosperity, and a presence of American troops are vital factors, as are other major strategic questions. They are extremely important. All parts of our relationship with China and passage of PNTR raise the probability we will be more successful in that area. 
   We must also take measures to help incorporate China positively into the region, and we must encourage China into the role of a responsible actor, both in the Asian region and globally. 
   The growth in commercial and economic activity now developing between us and China should form a pillar on which we can build a stable relationship. There are no guarantees. There never are guarantees in life. One has to do the best with what one has, with the resources one has available. Passage of PNTR gives us more resources. It is an enabler to help us increase the probability of a stronger commercial and economic relationship to help form that pillar. Again, there is no guarantee. 
   We must also try to avoid the constant ups and downs that have characterized the bilateral relationship over the past 30 years. 
   I am not going to stand here and chronicle the volatility of the ups and downs, but I do think it is important for us to lop off the peaks and the valleys in this somewhat volatile relationship with China as best we can, recognizing that we are only one side of the equation and China, of course, is the other. 
   But the more we try and the more we engage them at lots of different levels--whether it is trade, artistic exchanges, cultural exchanges, or military exchanges--the more likely it is we will not have to be so involved in this volatile activity. That means a stronger economic relationship between our two countries, which I think will be a major consequence of the passage of this bill. 
   I thank all my colleagues. This is going to be a good, solid vote. It is going to indicate that the United States is a player in the world community, that the United States is not retrenching itself, but moving forward, and that the United States is living up to its responsibilities as the leader, frankly, of the world in a way that is positive, constructive, and exercising its constructive roles. I am very proud of the action the Senate is about to take. 
   Mr. President, I yield back my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are approaching the end of our debate on PNTR. This legislation will authorize the President to grant permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China after he certifies to Congress that the terms of China's accession to the WTO are at least equivalent to those agreed in the U.S.-PRC bilateral agreement reached last November. 
   Before the President can make that certification, the ongoing multilateral negotiations in Geneva must be completed, specifically, the Protocol of Accession and the Working Party Report to the WTO General Council. 
   China is a nation where a free market and the rule of law are in the earliest stage of development. Accession to the WTO, and our granting PNTR, are just the first steps in that process. 
   China's integration into the global trade community will not be completed overnight. It will take a lot of work by economic reformers in China. And it will take a lot of work by leaders in the United States and in other WTO members to ensure that China stays on course. 
   Over the coming years, we will have to put a lot of effort into scrutinizing closely and constantly China's compliance with its commitments. That is why earlier this year I introduced the China WTO Compliance Act. I was glad that some of the provisions in my proposal were adopted by the House. Other issues raised in my bill will be dealt with in a three-year investigation that we on the Finance Committee have requested that the General Accounting Office carry out. And that is why I support the President's request for a significant increase in the resources of the Executive Branch to monitor compliance with trade agreements. 
   Today, I would like to mention several issues in the ongoing negotiations in Geneva. In addition to informing my colleagues about these issues, I am also using this opportunity to remind our American negotiators and the Chinese leadership about the importance of resolving these issues properly. 
   Section 401 of the bill states that it is the objective of the United States to obtain, in China's protocol of accession, an annual review within the WTO of China's compliance with its terms of accession. China is a nation where a free market and the rule of law are in the earliest stage of development. The success of the WTO, by contrast, is premised on its members having relatively free markets operating against a backdrop of the rule-of-law. For China's transition to membership in the world trading community to be smooth, China will have to undertake major reforms in many areas, from intellectual property law, to customs procedure, to judicial process. 
   Some of this is underway. It poses a uniquely massive challenge to China and to the world trading community. Some of the issues that come up may be handled through dispute settlement. But the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism has limited resources, and a flood of China cases could overwhelm the system. Rather than deal with all of China's transition issues one dispute at a time, it is vital to deal with groups of issues as a bloc, through regular annual reviews. 
   China has objected to having its implementation of trade obligations reviewed every other year, which is the current demand on the table in the protocol negotiations. They want to be treated as a developing country, which means a review every four years. China has also proposed that the focus of such reviews be shifted away from China and instead look at ``abuse by any Member of any specific provisions imposed especially on China in this Protocol.'' 
   This is absolutely unacceptable. The issue is China's implementation. If China believes that other members are abusing China-specific measures in the protocol of accession, it should challenge those practices in the dispute settlement mechanism. We cannot allow attention to be deflected from China's record. 
   In June, Canada offered an intriguing proposal, whereby each ``subsidiary body'' of the WTO, that is, the councils and committees that have responsibility for particular subject matters, would meet in special session at least once a year to review China's implementation of its trade obligations. We should support the Canadian proposal, which is a common-sense approach. 
   China has insisted for years that it should enjoy the rights and special treatment accorded to developing country members. We must continue to reject China's position on this point. China is unique. It is not simply another developing country, and it should not automatically be allowed to avail itself of developing country provisions in the WTO. China's size, the extent of state ownership, and the transitional nature of its economy and legal institutions, all should be taken into account in deciding the developing versus developed issue in particular instances. It must be on a case-by-case basis. 
   For example, if China automatically received developing country status for all purposes, it would receive special treatment under the subsidies agreement. Then, export subsidies and subsidies in the form of operating loss coverage would not be treated as prohibited subsidies. The burden of challenging those subsidies in the WTO would be much greater than under ordinary rules. This would be particularly troublesome, given the level of state ownership in China. 
   This bill contains a safeguard provision (sec. 103) that lets U.S. industries, workers, and farmers obtain relief from surges of imports from China. The provision reflects the terms of the November, 1999, U.S.-China bilateral agreement. Among its provisions is a rule that will govern the granting of relief when there is ``trade diversion''--that is, when another country provides safeguard relief from surges of Chinese goods, and the goods are then diverted to the United States. 
   China has proposed that ``trade diversion'' would only be considered to exist when there is clear evidence that imports are increasing ``significantly and absolutely,'' and are ``a significant cause of material injury'' to the domestic industry in the country to which the goods have been diverted. 
   We must reject this proposal. It is counter to our bilateral agreement in November which included none of these limitations on our taking action. 
   The safeguard provision, including insulation against trade diversion, is a very important feature of this bill. It ensures that if shifts in trade patterns following China's entry into the world trading system cause or threaten dislocations to American workers, businesses, and farmers, they will be able to obtain relief quickly. We must reject any efforts by China to weaken those commitments. 
   Under our bilateral agreement, China agreed to protect all rights acquired by American insurance companies prior to China joining the WTO. Specifically, China committed to permit existing insurance branch operations to sub-branch in the future on a wholly owned basis. I understand USTR continues to work with China to correct this situation, both bilaterally and multilaterally in Geneva. I have written to Ambassador Li to make certain he understands the importance I attach to this matter. It is essential that China rectify this situation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate bill 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. I would like to begin my comments today by drawing attention to the determined efforts of my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator RON WYDEN, on behalf of rural counties. Senator WYDEN has worked tirelessly to ensure that counties with federal lands get a fair deal. He has not been alone in his efforts. Senator CRAIG from Idaho has been a vocal champion of this legislation. And many other senators, notably Senator BOXER of California, have offered constructive input that has greatly improved the legislation now before us. 
   As we all know, counties containing large amounts of public lands are not able to raise sufficient revenues from taxes since the federal government is not required to pay state or local taxes. Montana has one of the highest percentages of federally owned land of any state. This has a very significant impact on the tax base of our counties, and they have suffered because of it. As revenues from our national forests have decreased, so too have the payments to counties. Fortunately, Senator WYDEN stepped in with a creative solution that ensures that counties have the option to receive much more steady funding. S. 1608 recognizes both the value of these public lands and the needs of the affected counties. It is a wise compromise which allows counties the freedom to choose the plan that best serves their needs. 
   Mr. President, I would like to say just a few comments about title III of S. 1608. I felt that it was very important that counties have flexibility, not only in how their funding is determined but also in how it is spent. This is why I proposed title III of this bill, and I am very pleased that the sponsors of the bill have accepted it. 
   Under this bill, each year counties may spend 15-20 percent of their funding on either title II projects or on title III projects. As originally drafted, S. 1608 focused primarily on activities occurring on federal lands. Title III was an effort to give counties the option to focus on activities that are not necessarily ``on'' federal lands, but that clearly relate to federal lands. 
   First, under title III, counties may use the funds as reimbursement for search, rescue and emergency services, including fire fighting performed on federal lands and paid for by the county. Mr. President, after the ravages of the recent fires in Montana, many of which are still burning, it is abundantly clear that counties desperately need this funding for both fire prevention and fire fighting. Counties that are stretching to make ends meet for basic services, such as road building and funding schools, simply can't afford to suddenly incur the massive costs associated with fighting wildfires. 
   I can't impress upon you enough the catastrophic impact that this summer's fires have had upon my state. The fires have raged out of control on our federal lands, such as the fire picture here (in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest which covered nearly 85,000 acres and has not yet been contained. Cities have spent weeks under a cloud of smoke, as you can see in this photo of Helena. People, houses, and wildlife have all been threatened, and it is thanks only to the heroic efforts of our firefighters that so few lives and structures have been lost. I was honored to spend some time with these courageous individuals, and I can tell you, you have never met a more hard-working, determined crowd of folks. We owe them a heartfelt thank you, and I would like 
   to express my personal gratitude for everything they have done. 
   The process of rehabilitation and clean-up has only begun, and the work we do now will be critical to ensuring the full recovery of our lands and our communities. For all of these reasons, I am very pleased that we were able to change this bill to make sure that counties in Montana and across the West could get much-needed funds for firefighting and related efforts this year and in future years. 
   It has also become clear that we need to do more to prevent danger from fires before they start. I've heard from many counties in Montana who have said that they could prevent loss of life and property if they had funding available to educate new homebuilders about where to build or not build their houses to reduce their exposure to wildfires and to make sure that emergency equipment can get to their homes. Homeowners need to know that a house built in the woods, especially if trees are not cleared away from the building, as shown, will be very difficult to save from fires. If the right materials are used in construction, however, homes can be made much less vulnerable. Under title III, counties will have the funding to do this kind of education. They will also be able to fund county planning efforts to increase the protection of people and property from wildfires. 
   Some of you may be under the mistaken impression that the entire state of Montana was on fire this summer, but let me assure you--the fires have not destroyed the beauty and value of our public lands. Under title III, counties can use funds to acquire easements to provide for nonmotorized access to public lands for hunting, fishing and other recreational purposes and to acquire conservation easements. These options are very important in states like Montana where growth is gradually shutting off access to public lands and eliminating important fish and wildlife habitat. These provisions will give counties the tools to make sure that we are able to pass the West's outdoor heritage on to our children and grandchildren. 
   This photo here is of Eric and Brittany Sharpe, children of Terry and Craig Sharpe of Helena. Eric and Brittany's dad is the head of the Montana Wildlife Federation, an organization that works non-stop to try to make sure that our children will be able to enjoy Montana's great fish and wildlife resource just as we do today. 
   Mr. President, let us never lose sight of the real reason we do the work we do. Let us never lose sight of the children or ever forget for even a moment that we have a moral obligation to pass this place on to them in as good a shape or better than we found it. 
   Finally, counties may also use funds to establish and conduct forest-related after school programs. Mr. President, the Washington Post recently reported that 20 percent of all children in America are left unattended after school. In Montana, which has one of the highest incidents of parents having to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet, this number may be even higher. What is clear is that children are less likely to get into trouble, less likely to commit acts of violence, if they are involved in after school programs. In my mind, this provision gives us a tremendous opportunity to work with our most precious asset--the youth--and to give them opportunities to learn about our forests and to gain hands-on experience in working on matters relating to our forests. 
   I was very pleased to be able to add these important options to a bill that is critically needed to ensure the fair treatment of our rural counties. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to acknowledge the vital importance of these efforts and to give this bill, and the rural counties of America, their full support. 
   Mr. President, before I close, I want to take a moment to elaborate on two issues that were addressed in a colloquy between myself, Senator WYDEN and Senator BOXER. 
   First is the question of whether a county can choose to allocate funds to both title II and title III in the same year. As should be clear from that colloquy, the bill has been drafted so that counties may choose to send their funds to either title II or title III in any given year, but not to both.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in closing, let me thank the bill's sponsors and all of the Senators who have exerted so much effort on the behalf of our rural counties. Especially, let me thank Senators WYDEN and CRAIG who have worked so hard to answer concerns that were raised by me and by other Senators, and who should receive full credit for the passage of this fine legislation. 
   Mr. President, I would like to draw attention to the determined efforts of my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator RON WYDEN, on behalf of rural counties. Senator WYDEN has worked tirelessly to ensure that counties with federal lands get a fair deal. As we all know, counties containing large amounts of public lands are not able to raise sufficient revenues from taxes since the federal government is not required to pay state or local taxes. Recognizing that this is fundamentally unfair to these counties, Congress has tried for some time to rectify this situation by providing funding from revenue generated on our public lands from payments in lieu of taxes in an effort to make the counties financially whole. 
   Unfortunately, as revenue from our national forests has decreased, so too have the payments to counties. This has been seriously disruptive to counties across the West. Fortunately, Senator WYDEN stepped in with a creative solution that insures that counties have the option to receive much more steady funding. The bill now before us, S. 1608, recognizes both the value of these public lands and the needs of the affected counties. It is a wise compromise which allows counties the freedom to choose the plan that best serves their needs.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to say just a few comments about title III of S. 1608. Senators WYDEN and CRAIG agreed to include title III in this bill at my request. I felt that it was very important that counties have flexibility, not only in how their funding is determined but also in how it is spent. This is why I proposed title III of this bill, and I am very pleased that the sponsors of the bill have accepted it. 
   As explained by my colleague Senator WYDEN, under this bill, each year, counties may spend 15-20 percent of their funding either on title II projects or on title III projects. There has been some debate about whether counties should be able to ``mix'' funds in a given year between title II and title III. Regardless of whether it would be a better policy to allow such mixing to occur or to maintain the current separation between titles II and III, it is clear that, as drafted, S. 1608 will not allow such mixing to occur. And while this may not be a perfect solution, rarely is any legislation passed by Congress that could be characterized as ``perfect.''

I am pleased that we were able to change this bill to make sure that counties in Montana and across the West could get much-needed funds for firefighting this year and in future years. 
   For similar reasons, I drafted title III to allow counties to use the funds to reimburse their expenses for search and rescue operations performed on federal lands and for the salaries and benefits of county employees who supervise adults or juveniles performing mandatory community service on public lands. 
   Second, under title III, counties may use the funds to acquire easements to provide for nonmotorized access to public lands for hunting, fishing and other recreational purposes and to acquire conservation easements. These options are very important in states like Montana where growth is gradually shutting off access to public lands and eliminating important fish and wildlife habitat. These provisions will give counties the tools to make sure that we are able to pass the West's outdoor heritage on to our children and grandchildren. 
   Third, counties may use funds to establish and conduct forest-related after school programs. Mr. President, the Washington Post recently reported that 20 percent of all children in America are left unattended after school. In Montana, which has one of the highest incidents of parents having to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet, this number may be even higher. What is clear is that children are less likely to get into trouble, less likely to commit acts of violence, if they are involved in after school programs. In my mind, this provision gives us a tremendous opportunity to work with our most precious asset--the youth--and to give them opportunities to learn about our forests and to gain hands-on experience in working on matters relating to our forests. 
   Finally, under title III, counties can use the funds for fire prevention and county planning. 
   These activities are vitally important. I've heard from many counties in Montana who have said that they could prevent loss of life and property if they had funding available to educate new homebuilders about where to build or not build their houses to reduce their exposure to wildfires and to make sure that emergency equipment can get to their homes. And the same thing is true with respect to the materials that homes are built out of and the manner in which homes are landscaped. Homeowners need to know that a house built in the woods should have a roof made out of tin or some other material that won't burn. Seemingly aesthetic decisions can make the difference between a home and ashes during a year like this one, and counties need funding to expand this type of awareness. 
   The same basic reasoning applies to county planning. Counties should have the funds available if they want to pass an ordinance requiring homeowners to clear brush away from their homes. this can help protect lives not only of homeowners, but also of the firefighters who will be called in to extinguish burning structure fires. This can allow counties to focus their emergency crews on problems that could not have been prevented. As written, this provision will also allow counties to fund other planning and zoning efforts to minimize the impact that unfettered development can have on our forests and streams. By providing local communities with the tools to address these types of problems, it is my sincere hope that this title will diminish the conflicts that occur around our public lands and will help ensure that our children and grandchildren can continue to enjoy these lands and the fish and wildlife that they support well in to the future.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to say a brief comment about the relationship between title III and the Resource Advisory Committees formed under title II. Unlike the projects in title II, the projects in title III are essentially local concerns. While they relate to the lands that are held in trust for the American people, the title III projects are not in any sense ``federal'' projects. Items such as county planning and zoning have always been seen as local matters and it is not the intent of this legislation to change that framework. 
   For that reason we have not given the Resource Advisory Committees the same role in title III as they have in title II. Under Section 204(a) of the bill, the Secretary may make a decision to approve a project only if it is submitted to the Secretary by the Resource Advisory Committee. By contrast, under title III, the counties approve the projects and the Resource Advisory Committee serves in an advisory capacity.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot on the Senate floor the last few days about the advantages to the United States of granting PNTR to China. In commercial terms, PNTR means that American farmers, ranchers, workers, manufacturers, and service providers can take advantage of what will be an unprecedented liberalization in the world's most populous market, and an economy that has grown almost ten percent annually for two decades. PNTR and China's accession to the WTO means that China will enter the global trade community, liberalize and open up much of its economy, and be subject to the operating rules and regulations of the WTO. 
   I would like to focus my remarks on the effect of PNTR on one very important sector of America's economy--agriculture. 
   We are in the third year of a severe agricultural crisis in the United States. Our farmers are suffering terribly from drought, record low prices, increased costs, and now damage due to unprecedented forest fires this summer. At the same time, the American food market is a mature one with almost no room for growth for our farmers and ranchers. Therefore, one part of the solution to the agricultural crisis lies in increasing the quantity and value of our agricultural exports, bringing the products of the world's most efficient farming to the people of the world. 
   That means ensuring that our producers are not besieged by dumped imports. That means our producers need time to adjust to surges in imports. That means working to dismantle the European Union's system of massive trade-distorting export subsidies to its farmers. That means reversing the trends that have reduced our agricultural exports by ten billion dollars since 1996. And that means bringing China into the WTO and granting them PNTR so that our farmers and ranchers can benefit from the significant liberalization commitments that China is making. 
   Let me review those changes that China has agreed to make as part of its WTO accession commitments. And remember, if we don't grant China PNTR, our competitors can take advantage of this new liberalization in China, while our ranchers and farmers will lose out. 
   First, the US-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement. Although this was technically separate from China's negotiations for WTO accession, it was an integral part of our bilateral negotiations. This agricultural agreement provides three specific benefits to American producers. 
   On wheat, China agreed to end a thirty year ban on Pacific Northwest wheat. This ban was based on spurious sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards. We completed the first shipment of Pacific Northwest wheat to China earlier this year. 
   On beef, under the agricultural agreement, China will accept meat and poultry from all USDA Food Safety Inspection Service-approved plants, honoring USDA inspection certificates. 
   On citrus, the agreement provided for a series of measures that would approve citrus for export to China. Chinese officials made several inspection trips to the United States, and the first shipment occurred earlier this year. 
   Second, China made significant trade concessions on bulk commodities. For  example, China agreed to a tariff rate quota on wheat of 7.3 million metric tons for its first year of membership in the WTO, increasing to 9.6 million tons in 2004. This contrasts with recent annual import of wheat at around two million tons. Ten percent of the tariff rate quota will be allocated to non-state trading entities. If state trading entities do not use their portion of the quota, the unused part will be given to non-state entities. Tariff rate quotas at similarly high levels will also be in effect for other commodities such as corn, cotton, rice, and soybean oil. 
   Third, tariffs themselves will be cut significantly. By January, 2004, the overall average for agricultural products of importance to the United States will drop from 31 percent to 14 percent. Beef goes down from 45 percent to 12 percent for frozen and to 25 percent for fresh. Pork drops from 20 percent to 12 percent. Poultry goes from 20 percent to 10 percent. 
   Fourth, foreigners will have the right to distribute imported products without going through a state-trading enterprise or middleman. 
   Fifth, China has committed not to use export subsidies for agricultural products. They have also committed to cap, and then reduce, trade-distorting domestic subsidies. 
   Sixth, there are several provisions that most people think apply only to manufactured goods, but, in fact, apply to agriculture as well. The United States can continue to use our non-market economy methodology in anti-dumping cases for 15 years, an important protection against dumped Chinese products. Also, for the next 12 years, we can take safeguard measures against specific products from China that cause, or threaten to cause, disruption in our market. 
   In short, once we grant China PNTR and the WTO accession process concludes, our farmers, ranchers, and food processors can begin to take advantage of vast new opportunities in China. Americans need to move aggressively to follow-up on these Chinese commitments. And we in the Congress and in the Executive Branch must put resources into monitoring closely Chinese compliance with those commitments. 
   Following my own advice about follow up, I will lead a delegation of Montana ranchers, farmers, and business people to China in December. I encourage all my Congressional colleagues to do likewise. I have also sent a letter to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji insisting that China fully comply with its agriculture commitments. 
   We have a lot to do in the Congress this year and next to help our farm economy. Approving PNTR is one important part of that agenda.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is often said that, ``Good health and good sense are two of life's greatest blessings.'' Senators GRASSLEY, JEFFORDS, and I hope to further the cause of good health and good sense today, through introduction of the Health Care Safety Net Oversight Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, currently no entity oversees America's health care safety net. This means that all safety net providers--including rural health clinics, community heath centers and emergency rooms--are laboring on their own. They are like master musicians performing without a conductor. Each is trying their hardest and performing their part--but no one is coordinating their efforts. No one is able to tell an actor when his services will be needed, or when he can take a break. 
   This act changes that, by creating the Safety Net Organizations and Patient Advisory Commission, an independent and nonpartisan commission to monitor the stability of the health care safety net. 
   What does this mean? 
   The Safety Net is made up of providers that deliver health services to the uninsured and vulnerable populations across America. These providers are often a last resort for patients who are unable to afford the health care they need and have nowhere else to turn. In my state, we have about 30 community health centers and rural health clinics, serving an estimated 80,000 persons per year. That translates into about one in ten Montanans. Were it not for these clinics and health centers, many of these folks--the uninsured and underinsured--would have no place to turn. 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly one in five Montanans were uninsured in 1998. This number has risen by 36 percent over the last ten years, and there are now only five states with a higher percentage of uninsured residents. When these uninsured seek medical treatment they are often not able to pay. Last year, Montana hospitals reported over $67 million in charity care and bad debt. And the problem is not going away. At current growth rates for the uninsured, as many as one in four Montanans will be uninsured by the year 2007. 
   But Mr. President, these people are not uninsured of their own volition. Eighty three percent of uninsured Montanans are in working families. And self-employed workers--including owners of small businesses--and their dependents account for one-fifth of the uninsured in our state. In fact, Montana ranks last in the nation with only 40 percent of firms offering a health insurance benefit. 
   So what do we do about this problem? How do we ensure that all Americans, irrespective of color, creed gender or geography, have access to quality health care? 
   Six or seven years ago, Congress and the administration worked on the problem of the uninsured. A tremendous amount of time and effort went into the Health Security Act, on both sides of the issue. As we know, passage of that bill failed. Since then, Congress has taken a more incremental approach to health care. Congress passed legislation in 1996 to ensure portability of health insurance. A year later, the CHIP program was signed into law, bipartisan legislation to cover children of working families. And last year, Congress passed the Work Incentives Improvement Act to allow disabled folks to continue working and not lose health care benefits. 
   But while these legislative actions are extremely important, they affect relatively few Americans. The fact remains, for most uninsured and underinsured Americans, the safety net is still the only place to turn. 
   Yet the safety net has been seriously damaged in recent years. According to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine, the health care safety net is ``intact but endangered.'' 
   For instance, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act cut payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals and Community health centers. It also cut reimbursement to rural health clinics, so critical to providing coverage to rural uninsured individuals. At the same time, Congress mandates that emergency departments care for anyone and everyone that darkens their door. Though not a reimbursement issue per se, the EMTALA dictates that all ER's care for all individuals, regardless of ability to pay. 
   Despite all these developments, there is no entity responsible for making changes to the safety net. And though SNOPAC will not solve the problem of America's uninsured, it will work to ensure that no holes develop in the Safety Net. An independent, non-partisan commission, modeled on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), SNOPAC will include professionals from across the policy and practical spectrum of health care. And like MedPAC, SNOPAC will report to the relevant committees of Congress on the status of its mission: tracking the well-being of the health care safety net. 
   Though it's not a panacea, SNOPAC is a positive step toward a coordinated approach in caring for the uninsured. Absent large-scale improvements in the number of insured Americans, we should at least work to monitor and care for what we already have--an intact, but endangered, health care safety net. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in this effort towards good health and good sense.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Further reserving the right to object, this is one of the strange situations where nobody is in charge and it is very disorganized. I came to the floor and I have been prepared to speak on this issue since the Senate came in session today. I was told there was no set order for speakers, and I talked to the staff on the committee that has jurisdiction over this bill. I am here and I don't see Senator KYL. 
   I again ask my good friend from Maine if she would revise her unanimous consent request so I could speak after Senator ENZI.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Thompson-Torricelli Amendment. 
   I am very concerned, along with all of my colleagues, about missile proliferation and the development of weapons of mass destruction. However, this particular amendment does not enhance our ability to prevent dangerous proliferation. Just the reverse. The amendment will make it even harder for the United States to contain proliferation. It will seriously damage important American economic interests. And, if added to H.R. 4444, it will kill PNTR. 
   Let me outline some of the principal problems I see in this proposal. 
   First, we already have a broad body of law covering proliferation of missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and the inputs to those weapons. Those laws provide sufficient authority to the President to take action. Some may argue that there are cases where the President has not acted in a timely fashion or in the appropriate way. But he does have the proper authority and needs no more.  
   Second, the proposal effectively ties the hands of the next President and all future Presidents. The proposal reduces a President's flexibility in using the threat of sanctions as leverage to force a change in behavior by a proliferating state. In recent months, we have seen, for the first time in 50 years, that reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea seems possible. We have been able to resume discussions with the North on missiles. What a tragedy it would be if we were required to impose sanctions against North Korea just at the moment when significant progress is possible in that potential tinderbox! 
   Third, the scope of this proposal is so broad that sanctions would hurt innocent people and innocent entities. It could restrict purely commercial transactions. Stop scientific and academic exchanges that are important to our nation. And reduce military-to-military discussions that provide our own military forces with the information and insight necessary for them to do their job. 
   Fourth, these sanctions are unilateral. We have seen, repeatedly over the last two decades, that unilateral sanctions don't work. Multilateral sanctions do work. Enactment of this legislation would antagonize some of our closest allies, with the result that they may not cooperate with us in the future on multilateral non-proliferation regimes. It may feel good to take a unilateral sanction, but any effective program to stop proliferation must involve all of our allies. 
   Unilateral sanctions also hurt American farmers, workers, and businesses. While we are taking these unilateral measures and reducing the ability of Americans to pursue commercial activities with China, our Japanese and European competitors will be very happy to take our place in that growing market. Little harm to China. Great economic harm to America. A real boon for Japan and Europe. And once markets are lost, getting them back at some later time will be very, very hard. 
   The impact of this proposal on our agricultural sector could be very serious. It would prevent the use of various commodity credit programs for sales to China. Our European, Canadian, and 
   Australian competitors would happily step in. Also, our farmers would be the likely first target of Chinese counter-retaliation. For these reasons, almost every major agricultural organization involved in trade opposes this legislation. 
   Finally, possible sanctions in this amendment include being barred from access to U.S. capital markets. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, testified on July 20 at the Senate Banking Committee. He said:  
   Most importantly, to the extent we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system.....The only thing that strikes me as a reasonable expectation is it can harm us more than it would harm others.  
    This would be the first time America's capital markets have been used as a unilateral foreign policy sanction. This idea is plain nutty. Why would we want to damage the capital markets that have contributed so much to our current prosperity? 
   As we vote on granting China permanent Normal Trade Relations status, this amendment would effectively nullify much of the progress we have made in our economic negotiations with China. 
   We need to integrate China into the international community. Chinese participation in the World Trade Organization and our granting them PNTR is a critically important first step. We also need to work closely with our allies to bring China into the Missile Technology Control Regime and to ensure Chinese compliance with it and other weapons control agreements. We need to work with our allies to address Chinese human rights abuses forcefully at the United Nations Commission on Human rights and elsewhere. We need to work with the international community to help ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. 
   I support strong action against proliferation of missiles or weapons of mass destruction by China or any other country. But the Thompson-Torricelli amendment moves us backwards in these efforts. 
   In addition to these very important substantive reasons to vote against this amendment, there is another reason--the very survival of the underlying PNTR legislation. This amendment, like all amendments, is a killer. An amendment to H.R. 4444 means a conference will be required. At this stage of the Congressional session in this Presidential election year, there can be no conference. There will be no conference. A positive vote on this amendment is a vote to kill PNTR. Every Senator must understand this and decide whether you want to kill PNTR, with all the negative ramifications for our economy and our ability to influence China in the future. 
   If this, or any, amendment passes, it will be a sign that the Senate has voted to kill PNTR. I will not be complicit in that effort. Therefore, if there is a successful amendment, I will vote against invoking cloture, and I will encourage all my colleagues to join me.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reemphasize the first point made by my friend from South Dakota. He is entirely accurate. We hear about the specter of floods. If you look at the facts, this amendment has nothing to do with floods. Why do I say that? It is because of the Army Corps of Engineers' own analysis. Looking at the alternatives, the current master manual, compared with the spring rise/split season, there is no statistical, no difference--it is 1 percent--in the flood control benefits between the two alternatives. None. One percent is statistically insignificant. 
   So you hear on the floor those protecting a dying industry using another scare tactic, and that is floods. That is totally inaccurate. In addition, the proposal of the spring rise/split season will be used in only 1 out of every 3 years. And the proposal also provides that if it looks as if there might be a wet year, or more precipitation in the year a spring rise might otherwise occur, there would be no spring rise. Why? Because the primary goal of the Corps of Engineers is flood protection. Let's take that off the table; take flooding and the wall of water down the river off the table. 
   In the 1993 and 1997 flood years, if this proposal had been in effect, there would be no spring rise and no split season. It would not exacerbate the 1993 and 1997 floods. 
   In addition, if this amendment to strike 103 is not adopted, we will have a big lawsuit on our hands. Why? Because the environmentalists will file a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers because of not protecting the Endangered Species Act. We would have a whole set of problems on our hands. Let's not have a lawsuit. Let's not have scare tactics for the sake of trying to protect a dying industry that need not be subsidized as it is now.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all my colleagues support the intent of the Wellstone amendment. Of course, we want to protect religious freedom all over the world. It is in our American Constitution. It is in our Bill of Rights. It is enshrined in the first amendment to the Constitution. It has helped make America the great country it is. There is no doubt about it. 
   But that is not what we are voting on. In effect, what we are voting on is whether our American farmers, ranchers, workers, manufacturers, or service providers will be able to take advantage of very significant liberalization and market openings that will occur in China once it joins the World Trade Organization. In effect, that is what we are voting on. 
   We are also voting on whether, if we deny Americans the opportunity to trade on a more liberalized basis with China, we are going to therefore allow our Japanese and European competitors to trade with China on much more favorable terms than we Americans would. 
   A vote for the Wellstone amendment means Americans will be closed out of the Chinese market of trade on favorable terms. It also means in effect that other countries--I mentioned before Japan and the European Union--will be able to trade on more favorable terms because they will have already ratified their PNTR with China. It is very clear at this stage of the congressional session, the Presidential election year, any amendment to H.R. 4444 will kill the bill. That is clear. I assure my colleagues that there will be no conference on this bill if there are any amendments at this stage in the congressional session. 
   I think it is also illustrative to point out what some very prominent religious leaders have said about the WTO and China. The Dalai Lama has said:  
   Joining the WTO, I think, is one way [for China] to change in the right direction. China must be brought into the mainstream of the world community. Forces of democracy in China get more encouragement through that way.  
   The Reverend Billy Graham said:  
   I believe it is far better for us to thoughtfully strengthen positive aspects of our relationship with China than to threaten it as an adversary. It is my experience nations can respond with friendship just as much as people do.  
   Many religious leaders think we should grant PNTR to China. I believe that. It is crystal clear what the other body will do if any amendments are passed here. If those amendments are passed, we will not have a bill. We will not have PNTR. Therefore, I will vote against the Wellstone amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Wellstone amendment, even though I believe almost all of us agree with its underlying intent. It is just not appropriate at this time on this bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Hollings amendment, which takes the ``P'' out of PNTR; that is, as I understand the amendment, it provides for an annual review of normal trade relations status. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-baucus-mt-3-20000907</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. I oppose that amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so, for a very simple reason. That is, if that amendment were agreed to and were to become part of the normal trading relations status with China, we automatically as Americans would be shooting ourselves in the foot, to say the least. 
   Why do I say that? As the world becomes more complicated, more complex, we hear about globalism, trade agreements, taxation or nontaxation of products over the Internet, and whatnot. Unfortunately, we have to rise to a higher level of more sophistication and learning and know what is going on with these arrangements and agreements so that we Americans are in a better economic condition. 
   It is difficult, but we have no choice with all the economic pressures that are advancing our world so quickly. The provisions of the World Trade Organization, I believe, very much help raise our economic standards. They are not perfect, but perfection cannot be the enemy of the good. If there were no WTO, it would be an economic free-for-all. Various countries would be doing their own deals at the expense of others, and it would be chaos. It would be a mess. At least the World Trade Organization is a vehicle, a forum, a mechanism, a way to get some civility, some process into trade matters and trade disputes that occur in this world. 
   One of the basic principles of the World Trade Organization is nondiscrimination and unconditionality. It is written in article 1 of the WTO. That means when a country grants trade concessions to another, it must do so unconditionally and on a nondiscriminatory basis so the same benefits, same provisions apply to all countries in the world. Otherwise, it is obvious if one country had certain trade agreements with one country and gave certain benefits to one and not another, there would be chaos. Article 1 of the WTO articles provides for nondiscrimination and unconditionality with respect to trade agreements and membership in the WTO. 
   The amendment before us is discriminatory and it is conditional by not making it permanent normal trade relations status but annual. That flatly violates article 1 of the WTO. As a consequence, if this amendment is adopted, we Americans could be giving up all the market-opening benefits to which China has agreed. That is, China would have no obligation to grant America those concessions, and they are major, whether it is auto tariffs or tariffs on other products. China is dramatically lowering tariffs. 
   China would also say: We Chinese agree to let you Americans set up your own distribution systems; you do not have to deal through Chinese companies anymore. The list is mind-boggling. It is amazing how much China has agreed to open up and to take American products that we have been trying to export to China that, frankly, have not been exported or significantly diverted because of current Chinese barriers.  
   My colleagues are going to hear the argument: This agreement is going to help Americans invest in China, and that takes away American jobs. Companies in America and around the world are already investing in China. It is happening today. 
   The agreement with China says: OK, there can be a lot less pressure on companies to build factories in China and make it more easy for American companies to ship products to China because China is dramatically reducing its barriers. 
   If this amendment is adopted, as I mentioned, China will be under no obligation to give us those breaks as we try to ship products to China. China will have no obligation to lower trade barriers that China has negotiated with the United States. However, China will be obligated to give those benefits and breaks to our competitors--to Japan, to the European Union--because they have entered WTO properly under the conditions of unconditionality and nondiscrimination. We have complied with article 1. 
   We have heard a lot of facts and figures about a lot of different issues, but the heart of this amendment is to take away the permanent nature of normal trade relations with China that we will be granting, and that means it is conditional, it is discriminatory and flatly violates article 1 of the WTO and, therefore, is a killer amendment, an anti-American amendment. It is anti-American because all other countries get benefits, and it is a killer because it means we will not get the benefits of China opening up to American exports. 
   Let me cite one of America's foremost experts on the GATT and the WTO, Professor John Jackson, Georgetown University Law Center:  
   The United States must extend permanent, unconditional MFN treatment to the PRC for the US to comply with US WTO obligations, unless the US invokes the ``opt-out'' provisions of the WTO.  
   Our own Congressional Research Service has concluded:  
   In order to make US law consistent with WTO obligations, Congress would need to remove the PRC from the Title IV regime (i.e., Jackson-Vanik) ..... The Title IV regime is inconsistent with MFN obligations when applied to a WTO member ..... because of the conditions that it attaches to the grant of nondiscriminatory treatment to that country's goods.  
   Let me respond to the criticism that we get nothing out of PNTR in terms of US trade benefits. 
   The fact is that granting China PNTR will bring a significant drop in Chinese tariffs. That will reduce the pressure many companies feel to invest in China in order to do business there. Our information technology products--computers, fiber optics, and telecommunications equipment--will see tariffs in China go to zero by 2004. Auto parts tariffs will average only ten percent by 2006. 
   When you add these significant tariff reductions to the new ability that American firms will have to import directly into China, control their own distribution and service networks, and own advertising firms, export of our goods and services will increase substantially. 
   Yes, American companies will continue to invest in China. But their ability also to export will be enhanced significantly by PNTR. Failure to grant China PNTR will allow our Japanese and European competitors to export more, but not our workers and our farmers. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as we begin the debate about whether to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR, we need to remind ourselves what the Senate vote is all about and what it is not about. 
   We are voting on whether American companies, American farmers, American workers, and American consumers will be able to take advantage of the new market opportunities afforded by changes that China will make over the next 5 years once it becomes a member of the World Trade Organization, the WTO. If we grant PNTR, China will have to give Americans all the benefits that we, and other WTO members, successfully negotiated after an arduous 13 years. If we fail to grant China PNTR status, then our Japanese and European competitors will be able to do business in China in ways that will be unavailable to us and at the expense of our exporters, our farmers, our manufacturers, our financial service companies, our Internet companies. 
   During the Senate debate this month, we will hear a lot about other issues, with Senators offering a plethora of amendments. The list will probably include human rights, worker rights, religious freedom, prison labor, Taiwan security, arms proliferation, and export of American jobs, among others. 
   Most, if not all, of these subjects are important. They should be of concern to the United States Senate, and to all Americans. A number of issues that go beyond the strict granting of PNTR to China, such as human rights, monitoring and enforcement of Chinese  commitments at the WTO, promotion of the rule of law, and Taiwan's accession to the WTO, are included in the bill we are considering. Other issues, such as proliferation and Taiwan security, are best dealt with apart from this legislation. 
   I share many of the concerns that some of my Senate colleagues will express over the coming days. But we are not voting on whether China is our friend. We are not voting about whether China should be an ally of the United States. And we are not voting about whether China should be a democracy or not. 
   To repeat, we are voting about whether American workers, farmers, and businesses will benefit from a decade-long negotiation, or whether we will allow our competitors in Japan and Europe to benefit while Americans do not. 
   That said, there are also broader implications involved in the Senate vote on PNTR. Let me mention a few. 
   First, a rejection of PNTR will be seen by China as an American policy decision to isolate them, to impair their growth and development, and to prevent China from emerging as a great regional power. That is how they will see it. Our intention should be to incorporate China into the global trading system, to get them to follow the same rules that we all use in international trade, and to make them accountable to an international institution for their trade policies and trade actions. The more China is integrated into the global system, the more responsibly they will act. It is that simple. 
   Second, a rejection of PNTR will likely lead to an indefinite delay in Taiwan's accession to the WTO. On the other hand, passage of PNTR will result in Taiwan's accession. What will happen after both China and Taiwan accede to--that is, are members of--the WTO? 
   They will participate together, along with all other WTO members, in meetings ranging from detailed technical sessions to Ministerials. There will be countless opportunities for interaction. Under the WTO's most-favored-nation rule, they will have to provide each other the same benefits that they grant to other members. 
   Taiwan's current policy limiting direct transportation, communication, and investment with the mainland will likely be found to violate WTO rules. Both will be able to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism against the other. And WTO-induced liberalization, in both Taiwan and the PRC, will increase and deepen ties between them in trade, investment, technology, transportation, information, communications, and travel. It will promote stability across the Taiwan Strait. 
   Third, consider Chinese behavior once it joins the WTO. We should not expect to see changes overnight; nobody does. Those people in business and government fighting to maintain their vested interests in the status quo will not disappear. The reformers will be strengthened, but they will still be under constant attack as the battle between the forces of reform and the forces of reaction continues. But it is certainly a vital interest of the United States to do everything we can to support those who favor reform over totalitarianism, 
   to support those who favor private enterprise over state-owned enterprises, to support those who favor incorporating China into the global trading community over autarky. 
   We need to engage China to promote responsible behavior internally and externally, to encourage them to play by international rules, to integrate the Chinese economy into the market-driven, middle-class-participatory economies of the West. China's entry into the WTO will help anchor and sustain these economic reform efforts and empower economic reformers. China will not become a market-driven economy overnight, but it is in our interest that they move in this direction, and WTO will help. 
   I look forward to a vigorous debate in the best tradition of the Senate. I urge all my colleagues to support this PNTR legislation without amendments. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Daschle-Baucus amendment to strike section 103 from the energy and water appropriations bill. One might ask why. The answer is very simple: Because section 103 is an anti-environmental rider that prevents the sound management of the Missouri River. It is that simple. 
   I begin by endorsing the points made so well by Senator DASCHLE. The Army Corps of Engineers is managing the Missouri River today on the basis of a master manual that was written in 1960. Guess what? It has not changed much since then. It is 40 years old. It is like trying to run the Internet based on a plan that was written in the heyday of rotary telephones. Conditions are different. Priorities are different. 
   As Senator DASCHLE explained, the master manual favors some uses of the river, such as barge traffic, that may have made sense in 1960 but makes little sense today. That is a very important point. In effect, a 40-year-old master manual favors the barge industry, which may have made sense in 1960 but makes virtually no sense today based upon the Corps's own economic analysis of the river, and it favors those uses over other uses, such as recreation, which are much more important now than they were in 1960. 
   As has been pointed out, the master manual also wastes taxpayers' dollars. We are today spending more than $8 million a year in operation and maintenance costs to support a $7 million barge industry. That is a bad deal for taxpayers. It is a subsidy that does not make sense. 
   In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on all those points. The Senator from South Dakota, the minority leader, has covered that ground very well. I do not want to repeat them. Instead, I would like to make three additional points. 
   First, the anti-environmental rider proposed by the Senator from Missouri harms my State of Montana. Second, it prevents the Corps of Engineers from complying with the law, from complying with the Endangered Species Act. And third, the rider derails a process of carefully revising the master manual, a process that is working. 
   In addition, I want to respond to an important argument made by the Senator from Missouri and other proponents of the rider. They argue that the rider is necessary to reduce the risk of floods. I will address that in a later point. 
   First, the impact of the rider on my State of Montana would be profound. The Missouri River flows not only through our State but through our history, as well as the history of other States. 
   Meriwether Lewis found the source of the Missouri River on August 12, 1805. It is at Three Forks, MT. It is shown on this map up here to the left, just east of the Continental Divide. 
   From there the river flows north, winding around near Helena, Great Falls, past Fort Benton, and then east through the lake created by the Fort Peck Dam near Glasgow. 
   There is Fort Peck Dam right here on the map. It is one of the major dams in the Missouri River system. 
   This is eastern Montana, an agricultural region. As the occupant of the Chair knows, agriculture has been suffering some very hard economic times for more than a decade with low prices for wheat, low prices for beef, drought. In eastern Montana, as well as in the western Dakotas, people are moving out, looking for jobs, virtually for survival. 
   Fort Peck Lake--that is this lake shown on the map right here--is a key part of our plan in our State to revive our State's economy, at least in that part of the State. It is a center for boating, a center for fishing, and, I might say, all kinds of recreation which is related to the lake. 
   Fort Peck is host to several major walleye tournaments each summer. The biggest is called the Governor's Cup, which attracts people from all around the State, all around the Nation, and all around the world. 
   I was there last July with one of the major sponsors of it, Diane Brant. I might say, she provides the gusto that makes the tournament work. It is incredible watching everybody line up to go out and go walleye fishing. Hundreds of boats went by the review stand, in single file, as walleye anglers set forth to prove their mettle. 
   This tournament brings jobs and excitement to the area. We are working hard to get more done. For example, I am working with Diane and local community leaders, and others, to establish a warm water fish hatchery on the north bank of the river to improve the walleye fishery. But we face a problem. It is a big one. Under the master manual, water levels in the Fort Peck Lake are often drawn down in the summer, largely to support the barge traffic downstream, which is an industry that need not be subsidized near to the degree that it is, and certainly according to the Army Corps of Engineers' information. 
   In fact, there have been times when the lake has been drawn down so low that boat ramps are a mile or more from the water's edge. This is what this photograph shows. This is a photograph of a boat landing at Fort Peck Lake. It is called Crooked Creek. It is a mile from the boat landing to the edge of the lake. 
   Why? Because Fort Peck has been drawn down to support a barge industry downstream. Frankly, the industry is dated and does not need to be supported near that much at the expense of people upstream, upriver, who, frankly, do not have many means of recreation. But the main thing they want to do is to be able to put a boat in the river. They are unable to do so because the boat 
   ramp is over a mile from the river.  
   These drawdowns have occurred frequently. The effect is devastating. Obviously, drawdowns prevent people from boating and fishing. They also reduce the numbers of walleyes, sturgeon, and other fish. 
   Let me be specific. Right now the water level at Fort Peck has been drawn down about 10 feet, to increase flows for downstream barge traffic. That is right now. A few weeks ago there was another walleye tournament at Crooked Creek, and it could well have been canceled. There was a lot of concern because ramps could not be used. Fortunately, it did not happen this year, but very often it does. 
   The drawdowns are a big part of the economic raw deal that eastern Montana has been getting for years. More balanced management of this system, which takes better account of upstream economic benefits is absolutely critical to reviving our State's economy in eastern Montana. 
   I am not going to stand here and try to kid anybody. This debate is, to a significant degree, about who gets Missouri River water, and when. That is accurate. But that is not all this debate is about. There is an awful lot more to it. 
   The section 103 rider prevents the Corps of Engineers from obeying the law of the land. Let me repeat that. The section 103 rider prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from obeying the law. It is that simple. It is that specific. It is that accurate. Specifically, it prevents the Corps from following the Endangered Species Act. 
   Before I get into the details, let me say a couple things about the Endangered Species Act. A lot of people are watching tonight. They may wonder: What is all this fuss about? There is less than a month left of the congressional session. Big issues need to be addressed--the budget, prescription drug coverage, trade with China. Why in the middle of all of this are we debating the fate of two birds and a fish? Good question. This is why. 
   Any time an issue such as this comes up, it is tempting to think only about the particular species that are being involved--the snail darter, the spotted owl. In this case, the piping plover, the least tern, and the pallid sturgeon. But that is thinking too narrowly. 
   In a much broader sense, the debate is about whether we really are serious about protecting endangered species. It is about whether our generation is going to meet its moral obligation to preserve the web of life that sustains us, and pass it along, as a legacy, to future generations. 
   If we create a loophole here, there will be pressure to create another loophole somewhere else--and another and another. Before you know it, the law will be shredded into tatters. 
   Don't get me wrong. I am not saying that the Endangered Species Act is perfect. It is not--far from it. I have worked for years to come up with reforms that would improve the act, that would increase public participation, assure that decisions are based on sound science, give a greater role to the States, get more certainty to landowners, bring people together, rather than drive them apart. 
   Over the last decade, I have worked as hard as anyone to reform the Endangered Species Act. But those reforms have not passed. They have been reported out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, but they have been kept off this Senate floor, as good as they are. 
   Nevertheless, in the meantime, the Endangered Species Act today remains the law of the land. We have to respect it. It is the law. 
   With that as background, let me turn to specifics and explain how Senator BOND's rider prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from managing the Missouri River in a way that is consistent with the law. 
   The river provides habitat for three endangered species: the piping plover, the least tern, and the pallid sturgeon. Each of these species evolved along a river that had higher flows in the spring and lower flows in the summer. That is the natural order of things. Each species depended on a life cycle that depended on this pattern. 
   The tern and the plover need higher flows in the spring. Why? To create the sandbars they nest on. Higher flows create sandbars. They need lower flows in the summer. Why? To create a buffer that reduces the risk that the nests might be washed away by, say, a storm. That is the natural order of things. 
   The sturgeon needs high flows in the spring for breeding and lower flows in the summer for the development of young fish. 
   This is a photo of a piping plover, a female, nesting over three eggs. 
   But the way I just described the natural order is not the way the river is being managed today. Under the master manual, today's management system, the Corps tries to maintain steady water levels through the spring and summer so there is always enough water to support the barge traffic downstream. It is this steady, even, but unnatural, flow that is driving the three species to the brink of extinction. 
   The management plan in the master manual may have made sense in 1960, before we knew about the threat to these species and before the Endangered Species Act was passed--I remind my colleagues, it was passed 13 years later, in 1973--but the master manual does not make sense today. It may have made sense in 1960, not today. Therefore, when the Corps began to revise the master manual 10 years ago--they have been at this for a long time--it was the first time the Corps seriously considered how the dams on the river affect endangered species. 
   There have been a lot of reports, a lot of discussions, a lot of give-and-take, but finally, after a decade of work, the process is moving forward. We are close to revising the master manual, revising it so we have a better, more balanced current use of the river, such as flood control, navigation, but also more to protect the plover, the tern, and the sturgeon. 
   How do we do this? Basically by providing for a moderate rise in flows in the spring and reduced flows in July and August. This is the so-called spring rise/split season alternative. This alternative has strong support. Fish and game officials from all seven Missouri River basin States say it is the right thing to do. 
   Last summer, they recommended that we--I will not read the whole quote, I will begin in the middle--  
   ..... provide higher flows during critical spring and early summer periods for native fish spawning and habitat development followed by lower flows during the critical summer period.  
   That is the recommendation. They have studied this thing, believe me. Guess what? The Fish and Wildlife Service agrees. Its draft biological opinion says:  
   Spring and summer flow management is an integral component of the measures to avoid jeopardy to listed species ..... This would include higher spring flows and lower summer flows than currently exist.  
   They have studied this. Guess what again? The Army Corps of Engineers recognizes the benefits of a spring rise and a split season. The Corps has said that ``periodic high flows are required for terns and plovers to remove encroaching vegetation, but during the nesting season, stable or declining flows are needed to avoid nesting flight.'' The Corps has made similar observations about the pallid sturgeon. In other words, the fish and game experts from the Missouri River basin States, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Corps of Engineers all recognize the importance of higher flows in the spring and lower flows in the summer. 
   This is where the section 103 rider comes in. Simply put, the rider prevents the Corps from revising the master manual to provide for higher water levels in the spring. The Senator from Missouri said so. He said that is what he intends to do. Those are the words of the rider: Prevent the master manual from providing higher water levels in the spring. By doing so, the rider contradicts what fish and game experts from the basin States and Federal agencies involved all recognize is necessary to provide more protection for the three endangered species and comply with the law. 
   Again, the debate is not just about the allocation of water between upstream and downstream States. The debate is also fundamentally about whether in one fell swoop we tell the Corps of Engineers to ignore the law; ignore the Endangered Species Act regarding the management of one of the country's largest rivers. The answer, of course, is obvious. The Corps should obey the law, just like everyone else. 
   Forget about the species for a minute, think about basic fairness. We  require private landowners to comply with the Endangered Species Act, so why shouldn't we also require the Federal Government to do so. They shouldn't get a free pass, especially when the Federal Government is the main cause of the problem. The Federal Government should not get a free pass. The Federal Government--in this case, the Army Corps of Engineers-- 
   should be held to the same standard as everybody else, and the Corps agrees that it should be held to that same standard. 
   That brings me to a related point; that is, government by litigation. Stop and think about this for a moment. If we think about it, we probably all know what will happen down the road if this rider becomes law. What is going to happen? The Fish and Wildlife Service will issue its final biological opinion. Like the draft, it probably will recommend higher flows in the spring, lower flows in the summer. Normally, the Corps would then revise the master manual. But because of the rider, the Corps cannot make the revisions necessary to comply with the Endangered Species Act. The rider says: Army Corps of Engineers, you cannot follow the law. 
   So what is going to happen? At that point there is certain to be a lawsuit brought by environmental groups challenging the Corps' failure to obey the law. Guess what? The environmental groups are likely to win. Why? Because the master manual will effectively ignore the needs of the species and therefore violate the Endangered Species Act. 
   It is not just my opinion that a master manual without a spring rise and a split season would ignore the needs of the endangered species. This is the unanimous opinion of the experts who reviewed the biological opinion. This unanimous recommendation was based on sound science. I might add, two people from the State of Missouri were on the peer review committee. They unanimously agreed that this is the alternative--that is spring rise/split season--which is necessary to protect these species. 
   Let's go back a little bit. Let's say that the rider passes. Let's say a lawsuit is brought. As I mentioned, the likelihood is very high that the plaintiffs, the environmentalists, would win. What happens next? We wind up with the river being operated not by the Corps of Engineers, not influenced by the Congress, but by the courts, a judge in some Federal court somewhere--they will get venue probably somewhere along the Missouri River--will be overseeing the operation of the entire Missouri River system; again, because of a lawsuit that wins. That might be politically convenient for some, but it is an abdication of our responsibility. As we have seen along the Columbia and Snake Rivers, it generates much more litigation and much more uncertainty. 
   Let us not go down the path of litigation. We do have a process in place to carefully revise the master manual. It has been underway for years; 10 years to be more specific. Now at the last moment, when the end is in sight, here we find a rider on an appropriations bill which would derail the process by taking not only one of the alternatives right off the table but the one that probably is necessary to comply with the law. Of course, that is not fair; of course, it is not right. It is not the right way for us to be doing business here. Instead, we should give the process we began 10 years ago a chance to work. 
   Now that we have a draft biological opinion, there will be an opportunity--this is a very important point--for public comment, both on the draft and on the later environmental impact statement. That way we have a decision that is not made in a vacuum. But this rider makes a mockery of that process. There will be an extensive period for public comment, but the public agencies cannot take any of those comments into account. That is what this rider does. It says: OK, here is your alternative, but you can't be implemented so the comments are irrelevant. What kind of message does that send to our people, already cynical about the way Government works? I say there is a better way: allow the process to work. 
   With that, I will briefly respond to a point made by the Senator from Missouri and some of his supporters. Concern has been expressed that if we have higher flows in the spring, there is a greater chance of flooding--a wonderful metaphor, floods; wonderful picture, floods; wall of water; risky proposition. It gets people scared and nervous, obviously. That is what it is designed to do. It is designed to scare people, scare them into supporting the rider. But we are not only emotional entities, we are supposedly analytical beings. 
   We are supposed to think about this stuff a little bit, look at the facts, not just the emotion. So let's look at the facts, I say to my other good friend from Missouri who is managing this bill at this time. 
   First of all, nobody wants floods. Flood control comes first. There is no question about it. Flood control comes first. I might say, though, the Corps and other agencies have taken flood control into account. In fact, the Corps has modeled many different river management alternatives. Their models show that under a spring rise/split season, there is no difference in flood control. Statistically, it is about 1 percent, which is basically zero. The Army Corps of Engineers has taken this question fully into account already. Of course, they would; it is their responsibility, and they have done that. Their conclusions show that under this alternative, there is virtually no difference in flooding compared with the current master manual--virtually none. 
   I heard one of my good friends from Missouri say, well, gee, nobody can predict the weather. Mr. President, that is a total red herring, totally irrelevant. That has nothing to do with what we are talking about here. We can't predict the weather today under the current master manual or tomorrow if the spring rise/split season are adopted--in either event. The two floods mentioned--in 1993 and 1997--under this proposal, the spring rise/split season, would not have been in effect; that is, the spring rise/split season proposal would not have been permitted because of the modeling and the anticipation of the flood years 1993 or 1997. Actually, the spring rise is to be implemented only once every 3 years. Say year No. 1 comes up, and 4 years later year No. 1 comes up again, and this might be a flood year. The model says, no, we don't implement a spring rise; we are not going to take the risk of more flooding. 
   So let's get the flood scare tactic off the table here. It has nothing to do with what we are talking about. The Army Corps of Engineers' own models conclude that the risk of flooding is virtually insignificant. 
   In closing, I want to also point out one other thing. The basic argument of the Senator from Missouri is that we are just taking one item off the table--spring rise/split season. That is all we are doing. We are not taking other alternatives off the table, other environmental enhancement measures, wetlands restoration, and habitat restoration. We are not taking that off the table. So what is the big fuss here? That is the basic argument. 
   The flaw in that argument is that the people who have studied this, the peer reviewers, have unanimously concluded that both are needed in order to solve this problem--that is, both a spring rise/split season and legislation to help restore habitat. Both are needed. They have concluded you can't have one without the other; you have to have both. You have to have the spring rise/split season. It makes sense because that is the natural order of things; that is the way the river runs naturally. It tends to flood in the spring and not later on. 
   The argument has also been made that this is going to hurt Mississippi barge traffic downstream. Frankly, that is another red herring designed to scare Senators downstream from Missouri, from St. Louis. It is a scare tactic because if you look at the data, at the facts, the facts show that, actually, because more water is being let out of the dams in the spring, and it is saved in the summer, on a net basis, they are going to have to let a little bit more out in the fall, which benefits the barge industry on the Mississippi. So it is a red herring. It is inaccurate--more to the point--that this proposal would hurt barge traffic down from St. Louis. That is not right. The Corps data shows more water is going to be released at the time it is more necessary. 
   To sum it all up, let's pass this amendment that strikes section 103.  Let the process continue to work. There is ample opportunity for public comment. But let's not disrupt it in a way that will cause a lawsuit and will cause a lot more problems than it will solve. I understand Senators who feel obligated, regardless of the facts, to support the Senator. But let's do what is right and not pass this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just several points for the record. In all due respect, listening to my colleagues, there were lots of conclusions. I don't hear a lot of facts, support for the statements made. 
   One of the statements I heard is that flood control benefits will be much worse under the preferred plan, that is the spring rise/split season. But that is not what the facts are, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. If you look at all the various data here on all the various alternatives that the Corps considered, it totaled up the flood control benefits for the river from the Fort Peck Dam down to the mouth, and I must say there is statistically no difference in flood control benefits. So this big scare tactic of floods--I have heard some say, not on this floor, a wall of water--is, according to the facts, inaccurate. It is inaccurate according to the modeling done by the Corps on all the various alternatives. 
   The benefits under the current master manual, flood control benefits, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, are about $414 million. The spring rise/split season flood control benefits are virtually statistically the same; that is, $410 million--virtually no difference. Those are the facts. Not the rhetoric, not the abstraction, not the generalization, but the facts. 
   Second, I have heard here that the spring rise/split season will increase Mississippi River navigation costs. That is the assertion. Let's look at the facts, again, facts according to studies done by the Army Corps of Engineers--not by that dreaded Fish and Wildlife Service, but by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   The facts: If you look at the average annual Mississippi River navigation costs for the Army Corps of Engineers, under the master manual it is about $45.70 million; under the spring rise alternative is it $46.85, which comes out to less than a 1-percent difference. So, again, it is a scare tactic and an inaccurate scare tactic to say that the spring rise/split season is going to increase navigational costs downriver on the Mississippi. It is just not accurate, according to studies done by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   I have also heard on the floor this evening that the spring rise/split season will decrease hydropower benefits for the main stem reservoir system. That is the assertion. That is the rhetoric. Let's look at the facts. Let's look at what the Army Corps of Engineers' actual data says. I have it here before me. Under the current master manual, the average annual hydropower benefits total $676 million. Under the spring rise/split season, the average annual hydropower benefits are higher, $683 million; not lower, higher. So the hydropower benefits under the spring rise/split season are actually better, higher than they are under the current master manual. 
   Another point, you have heard stated many times on the floor tonight this provision has been in the appropriations bill for about 4 years and there has been no objection; the President hasn't objected, so what is the big deal? The difference is in those prior years it was all abstraction. That is, there was no Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion. We were dealing with thin air, not dealing with something substantive. Now we are. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued their biological opinion. We have something definite. And they concluded the spring rise/split season is necessary. 
   On that same point, I might say the group that peer-reviewed this proposal--I think there are seven or eight from the Missouri River basin--unanimously concluded this is necessary. 
   I might tease my good friend from Missouri, saying his colleague at length quoted a Missourian who has had problems with the proposal alternative. I might tease my friend from Missouri, pointing out of the seven scientists on the peer review who unanimously concluded this makes sense, two of them are Missourians, one with the department of conservation and the other with the University of Missouri at Columbia. One says it is a bad idea; two say it is a good idea. I will take the majority vote from the Missourians. 
   I might also point out that basically we want the Corps of Engineers to follow the law. Under the law, whenever a species is threatened or endangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service consults with the relevant agency--in this case the Army Corps of Engineers. And under the law, the alternative must comply with the Endangered Species Act. It will not have the devastating effect that has been asserted. 
   I say so not as an assertion but backed up by facts, backed up by the Army Corps of Engineers' own data. Look at the data. The data shows, A, this is not going to cause all the problems that have been asserted and, B, this is probably necessary under the law. Otherwise, it is thrown in the courts, and we all know what happens when something like this is thrown into the judicial system. We will be wrapped up trying to resolve this for years and years. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to do what is right. Follow the science, follow the law, and vote to delete section 103 from the appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to say it has been a good debate. Our views have been aired. I deeply respect that different Senators might have different points of view on this issue. After all, that is why we run for this job. That is why we are here. We all have various points of view. I do not want to be corny, but that is what makes democracy strong--various points of view. 
   I very much respect and appreciate my good friend from Missouri and others who are arguing to include this provision in the appropriations bill to prevent the spring rise. My basic point is we have different points of view on this. My basic point is let the process work, do not preempt it. There will be plenty of opportunities for comments on the draft opinion and on whatever alternative the Army Corps of Engineers picks. There are lots of different options. Let's not prejudge it by saying it cannot be one as opposed to others. Somebody might come up with a better idea between now and then. My belief is we should let the process work. We can let it work by not adopting this rider to the appropriations bill. We should work through this as it evolves. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join the minority leader and others who have expressed strong opposition to section 103 of the energy and water appropriations bill, which affects the management of the Missouri River. 
   From the debate that we've had thus far, you might think that this is pretty straightforward. Upstream states against downstream states, in a conventional battle about who gets water, how much they get, and when they get it. 
   I'm not going to kid anybody. That is a big part of the debate. I'm from an upstream state. We believe that we've been getting a bad deal for years. We want more balanced management of the system. That will, among other things, give more weight to the use of the water for recreation upstream, at places like Fort Peck reservoir in Montana. 
   Under the current river operations, there are times when the lake has been drawn down so low that boat ramps are a mile or more from the water's edge. 
   Our project manager at Fort Peck, Roy Snyder, who does a great job at that facility, has talked to me about how much healthier the river would be with a spring rise/split season management. 
   But it's not just a conventional battle over water. There's more to it. A lot more. 
   You wouldn't necessarily know that from the text of the provision itself. It says that none of the funds made available in the bill:  
   ..... may be used to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual when it is made known to the Federal entity or official to which the funds are made available that such revision provides for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.  
   That's what the bill says. 
   Here's what it does. 
   Simply put, it prohibits the Secretary of the Army from obeying the law of the land. Specifically, it prohibits the Secretary from complying with the Endangered Species Act. 
   Let me explain. Like any other Federal agency, the Army Corps of Engineers has a legal obligation, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to operate in a way that does not jeopardize the existence of any endangered species. 
   That's just common sense. After all, private landowners have to comply with the Endangered Species Act. Why should federal agencies get a free pass? 
   They shouldn't. The federal government should do its part. That's why section 7 is a fundamental part of the ESA. Without section 7, the ESA would be unfair to private landowners and, in many cases, would provide no protection for endangered species whatsoever. 
   Let's turn to the Missouri River. The river provides habitat for three endangered species: The pallid sturgeon, the piping plover, and the least interior tern. 
   Accordingly, in developing its new master manual, which will govern the  operation of the river, the Corps is legally required to propose a management approach that protects the habitat for these three species. 
   Now, under section 7, when there's a pretty good chance that a federal agency's actions might jeopardize a species, the agency must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   That's the right approach. When it comes to the nuts and bolts of running a river system, the Corps is the expert. But, when it comes to the nuts and bolts of protecting a species, the Fish and Wildlife Service is the expert. No question. 
   So, as it is legally required to do, the Corps has consulted with the Fish and Wildlife Service, initially under what's called the ``informal consultation process.'' 
   There have been problems. Serious problems. 
   When the Corps issued the first Environmental Impact Statement for the Master Manual, back in 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a draft opinion saying that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation would jeopardize the three species. 
   In 1998, the Corps issued a revised EIS. Once again, the Fish and Wildlife Service said that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation still would jeopardize the three species. 
   Then we made progress. On March 30 of this year, the Corps announced that it was entering into a formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and would rely on the Service's biological judgment to propose an alternative that does not jeopardize the species. In other words, it would fully comply with the ESA. 
   We expect the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue it's biological opinion any day now. That opinion will explain, based on the best scientific information available, how to provide the needed protection for the recovery of the 3 endangered species on the river. 
   Nobody outside the agency knows for sure what the biological opinion will say. But, based on all of the scientific discussion that's gone on so far, there's a good likelihood that it will require more releases of water in the spring, to maintain the instream flows necessary to provide habitat for the sturgeon, plover, and tern. 
   That probably will mean fewer releases in the summer which, some will argue, could affect barge traffic downstream. 
   That's where section 103 of the bill comes in. It prevents the Corps releasing more water in the spring. 
   In other words, if the biological opinion comes out the way most folks expect it to, section 103 prevents the Corps from complying with the Endangered Species Act. 
   So, again, this debate is not just about the allocation of water between upstream and downstream states. 
   The debate is also, fundamentally, about whether, in one fell swoop, we should waive the application of the Endangered Species Act to one of the largest rivers in the country. The river, I might add, that is the wellspring of the history of the American west. 
   I suggest that the answer is obvious. 
   We should not. 
   Mr. President, let me also respond to a point that some of the supporters of section 103 have made. 
   They argue, in essence, that we've lost our chance. Sort of like the legal notion of estoppel. This provision has been in the bill for several years, they argue. We've never tried to delete it before. 
   So, I suppose they're trying to imply, it's somehow inappropriate for us to raise it now. 
   This argument is a red herring. A distraction. 
   Up until now, we've never been in a situation in which there was an impending biological opinion under the endangered Species Act. So, by definition, the earlier provisions did not override the Endangered Species Act. 
   What's more, in the absence of a biological opinion, there was no real likelihood that the Corps would implement a spring rise. 
   So the provision was theoretical. Symbolic. It had absolutely no practical effect. 
   Now, Mr. President, it most certainly will. That's why we are raising the issue. 
   One final point. If we pass section 103, and the Corps is directed to operate the system in violation of the Endangered Species Act, there will be a lawsuit. 
   That will have two effects. First, it will slow things down. Second, it may well put us in the position of having the river operated, in effect, by the courts rather than by the Corps. 
   We've seen this happen along the Columbia Snake River system, and it's not been an easy experience for anyone. 
   In closing, I suggest that there's a better way. After all, once a biological opinion is issued, there will be an opportunity for public comment, so this decision will not be made in a vacuum. 
   In fact, there have been countless public meetings and forums on the revision of the Master Manual over the years. And that's as it should be. 
   So let's not create a special exemption for the Corps. Let's require them to abide by the same law that we apply to everybody else. 
   Let's allow the regular process to work. Let's allow the agencies to continue to consult and figure out how to strike the balance that's necessary to manage this mighty and beautiful river: for upstream states, for downstream states, and for the protection of endangered species; that is, for all of us.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very glad the Senate has voted to invoke cloture and will finally get to the bill granting China permanent normal trade relations status. That bill will come up in September. That legislation has the strong support of at least three-quarters of the Members of this body, and it is deeply in our national interests. We should have rapidly disposed of it months ago. But later is better than never. I hope very much when we bring it up in September that we have a very large vote--at least three-quarters, as I earlier stated. 
   When we make that vote, it will be a profound choice. The question will be, Do we bring China into the orbit of the global trading community with its rule of law? Or do we choose to isolate and contain China, creating a 21st century version of a cold war in Asia? 
   China is not our enemy. China is not our friend. The issue for us is how to engage China, and this means engagement with no illusions--engagement with a purpose. How do we steer China's energies into productive, peaceful, and stable relationships within the region and globally? For just as we isolate China at our peril, we engage them to our advantage. 
   The incorporation of China into the WTO--and that includes granting them PNTR--is a national imperative for the United States of America. 
   I might add that when the debate comes up on PNTR in September, various Senators will offer amendments, as is their right, to that legislation. I think it is essential that we maintain the integrity of the House-passed bill. Many of those amendments that will be coming are very worthy amendments, and in another context they should pass. I would vote for them. But to maintain the integrity of the House-passed bill, I will strongly urge my colleagues to vote against amendments that are added on to the PNTR legislation, as worthy as they are, even though Senators certainly have a right to bring them up, because if those amendments were to pass, we would no longer be maintaining the integrity of the House-passed bill. But the bill would have to go back to conference, and that would, in my judgment, jeopardize passage of PNTR to such a great degree that we should take the extraordinary step of not passing those amendments. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this morning we voted on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. I rise to address an issue that will certainly arise in the debate. The issue is the U.S. embargo on Cuba as it relates to food and medicine. 
   Earlier this month, I traveled to Havana along with Senators ROBERTS and AKAKA. It was a brief trip, but it gave us an opportunity to meet with a wide range of people. We met with Cuban Cabinet Ministers and dissidents, with the head of the largest NGO in Cuba, 
   and also with a good number of foreign ambassadors, and with President Fidel Castro himself. I might say that was a marathon 10-hour session, about half of it dining. 
   I left those meetings more convinced than ever that it is time to end our cold war policy towards Cuba. We should have normal trade relations with Cuba. Let me explain why. 
   First, this is a unilateral sanction. Nobody else in the world supports it. Not even our closest allies. Unilateral economic sanctions, don't make sense unless our national security is at stake. Forty years ago Cuba threatened our national security. The Soviet Union planted nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. Twenty years ago, Cuba was still acting as a force to destabilize Central America. 
   Those days are gone. The missiles are gone. The Soviet Union is gone. Cuban military and guerilla forces are gone from Central America. The security threat is gone. But the embargo remains. 
   My reason for my opposing unilateral sanctions is entirely pragmatic. They don't work. They never worked in the past and they will not work in the future. Whenever we stop our farmers and business people from exporting, our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors rush in to fill the gap. Unilateral sanctions are a hopelessly ineffective tool. 
   The second reason for ending the embargo is that the US embargo actually helps Castro. 
   How does it help Castro? I saw it for myself in Havana. The Cuban economy is in shambles. The people's rights are repressed. Fidel Castro blames it all on the embargo. He uses the embargo as the scapegoat for Cuba's misery. Without the embargo, he would have no one to blame. 
   For the past ten years I have worked towards normalizing our trade with China. My operating guideline has been ``Engagement Without Illusions.'' Trade rules don't automatically and instantly yield trade results. We have to push hard every day to see that countries follow the rules. That's certainly the case with China. 
   I have the same attitude towards Cuba. Yes, we should lift the embargo. We should do it without preconditions and without demanding any quid pro quo from Cuba. We should engage them economically. But we should do so without illusions. Once we lift the embargo, Cuba will not become a major buyer of our farm goods or manufactured products overnight. 
   We need to be realistic. With Cuba's failed economy and low income, ending the embargo won't cause a huge surge of U.S. products to Cuba. Instead, it will start sales of some goods, such as food, medicine, some manufactures, and some telecom and Internet services.  
   In addition, ending the embargo will increase Cuban exposure to the United States. It will bring Cubans into contact with our tourists, business people, students, and scholars. It will bring Americans into contact with those who will be part of the post-Castro Cuba. It will spur more investment in Cuba's tourist infrastructure, helping, even if only a little, to further develop a private sector in the economy. 
   In May of this year, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would repeal all of the Cuba- specific statutes that create the embargo. That includes the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and the 1996 Helms-Burton Act. I look forward to the day when that legislation will pass and we have a normal economic relationship with Cuba. 
   Until that day, I support measures such as this amendment which dismantle the embargo brick by brick. The sanctions on sales of food and medicine to Cuba are especially offensive. 
   Last year, legislation to end unilateral sanctions on food and medicine passed the Senate by a vote of 70 to 28. That legislation was hijacked by the House in conference. This year we passed similar legislation again as part of the Agriculture appropriations bill. I hope our conferees stand firm and ensure its passage this year, with one correction. 
   This year the sanctions provisions of the Agriculture appropriations bill contain a new requirement. The bill requires farmers who want to sell food to foreign governments of concern to get a specific license. That is needless red tape which will make it harder to export. Last year the bill we passed had no such licensing requirement. We should strike that provision in the Agriculture appropriations conference this year. 
   When we begin debate on the bill, one of my colleagues will offer an amendment to address unilateral sanctions on food and medicine from a different angle. The amendment will cut off funding to enforce and administer them. The House passed a similar measure by a substantial majority. We should do the same in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote in favor of this amendment and will support the ultimate lifting of the entire Cuba trade embargo.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. We are living in a time of unprecedented prosperity. However this prosperity has not reached every American equally. The boom on Wall Street has not reached Main Street in many regions of our nation. The problem is quite simple. Many of our lower income communities are unable to attract the investment capital that is allowing more affluent areas to flourish. As the United States economy continues to grow it has become more and more apparent that attracting capital to these communities is one of the largest challenges facing the private sector and all levels of government. 
   It is important to keep in mind that this is not just an urban problem. Many rural communities, especially those that rely on agriculture, are watching their jobs disappear with nothing on the horizon in the form of new business or industry to offer much hope. My home state of Montana is facing this economic turmoil right now. A state that was built on agriculture, mining, and timber has watched these industries diminish to the point that Montana is now 50th in per-capita income relative to other states--dead last. 
   We often hear the phrase ``digital divide.'' Well, Montana is standing on the edge of an economic divide, but we are not quitters. Montana has much to offer. We have an unparalleled quality of life, a highly-educated work force, a burgeoning high-tech sector, and top-notch schools. In many respects, we are right on the cusp of an economic upswing. However, we are having an extremely difficult time attracting the investment capital that we need to become a partner in the Internet mainstream, create good paying jobs, and truly turn the economic corner. 
   This past June over the course of two days, I convened a Montana Economic Development Summit that brought together not only our state's leaders and decision makers, but also outside experts in various disciplines in an effort to build a road map for improving Montana's economy. We covered many issues, but primarily focused on high-tech, business development, and marketing and trade. We tackled tough questions such as how we retain and support our current businesses and also attract new businesses that truly fit with Montanans and their values. Three points came up time and again. First, the need for and inability to get the necessary investment capital. We simply do not have the population or resources available that larger states enjoy. Second, our window of opportunity is closing. Time moves faster than it used to and if we don't act quickly the world will move right past us. Third, and most importantly, any action or strategy that we take must come from begin locally. Economic development initiatives must be bottom-up and not top-down or they just will not work. 
   It is for these three reasons that I am cosponsoring this legislation. The New Markets proposals are a quick and efficient way to leverage the necessary investment in lower-income communities through private/public partnerships. And it will give these communities the tools they need to map their own economic destiny and create the better paying jobs that are so desperately needed. 
   Two portions illustrate the private/public partnership. On the public side, the Trade Adjustment Assistance provision will enhance the ability of each community to be proactive in crafting a long-term strategy for economic development. This is crucial for communities and regions in rural areas that are natural resource dependent and have suffered severe employment losses in the past decade. For the private sector, the New Markets tax credit will create opportunity by providing a tangible incentive for companies to take a serious look at areas of the country that are currently being ignored. 
   In closing, this legislation will provide the necessary ingredients for revitalizing America's less fortunate rural areas. It will help target investment to these communities and it will allow them the flexibility to build their economies on their terms and their ability. I commend my colleague from Virginia, Senator ROBB, for introducing such proactive legislation that addresses several of the most urgent issues facing economically troubled areas. Finally, I urge my colleagues to work together and pass this legislation so that states like Montana can begin their long climb back up to economic stability and prosperity.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to follow on with the comments of my good friend from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, and praise him for pointing out that the conference system is becoming bankrupt. 
   Way too often conferees put in measures and take out measures that have nothing to do with the underlying bill that goes to conference. It is becoming so bad that I think sometime--my hope is in the next Congress--the Senator from Iowa, myself, and others should meet with our leadership to prevent this from continually happening. It bankrupts the process. It also causes more Americans to become even more concerned about the political process. We, as Senators, cannot go home and say what is or is not happening. Rather, we have to go home and report just what the Senator from Iowa reported--that somehow, by magic or by mystery, things sort of appear and disappear. It does not make us feel good as Senators because we like to know what is occurring. It certainly doesn't help our constituents feel any better about the process because they hope we know what is happening. More than that, they hope we are fighting for their case. But if we don't know the contents of the conference process, we don't know how something gets put in or taken out, and we look foolish. It is a major abrogation of our responsibility as a Senate to the American people for whom we work. They are, after all, our employers. At times, the Senate is too secretive. 
   It reminds me of an incident I was involved in when I first came to the House more than 20-some years ago. At that time, I was a freshman House Member. I had a few free minutes one afternoon--about an hour or two. I thought that I would go to the conference on the tax bill; I might learn something. I thought I would go to the conference and learn a little about tax law and the conference process. 
   I called around to try to figure out where the conference was meeting. Nobody would tell me. At that time, Mike Mansfield from Montana was the majority leader of the Senate. I thought I could call Senator Mansfield's office; certainly they could tell me where the conference was meeting. They did. They told me. It was in the big hearing room over in the Longworth Building. There was a policeman standing at the door leading to the executive room. I knew what was going on. He challenged me. I said I was a Member. I intended to reply that I was a member of the conference, but, rationalizing, I said I was a Member of Congress, and he waved me in. 
   I walked back into the executive room. There were Senate Members in the hearing room on one side of the table with conferees, and Russell Long was at the table with House conferees. Russell Long was talking about when he was a kid in Louisiana. It was great listening to it. There was a sea of executive branch people. In the hearing room with Treasury Secretary Simon was a sea of Treasury employees. 
   I took an out-of-the-way spot. I found a chair over on the side, and I sat down out of the way to watch. After about 10 minutes, Congressman Jim Burke from Massachusetts shuffled over 
   to me--an elderly man. He came to me and said: I am sorry. I have to ask you to leave. Leave? Why? He said it was just the rules. I said respectfully that I would like to know what rule was requiring me to leave. He said, well, it is the Senate rules. So I said, well, I appreciate that. As a House Member, I wanted to know which Senate rule it was that prohibited my attendance as a Member of Congress watching this conference. He said, well, it is just the Senate rule. 
   I thought for a while. I thought: That is wrong; it is not right. I am not going to make a big fuss about it right here; I will later. I am going to leave because he asked me to leave, but I will see what I can do about it. It is the rule. 
   For example, Congressman Bill Green couldn't be there either. Bill Green was then a Congressman and the member of the House Ways and Means Committee in the House who authored a provision to delete the depletion allowance that was in the House bill. Even he could not attend, the rule then being nobody could attend a conference except conferees--nobody else. But there were more people from the executive branch. They were there, along with Treasury Secretary Simon. 
   I came over to the House floor. I mentioned this to Congressman Mikva from Illinois. He said: MAX, you are entirely right. That is wrong. I have been fighting that rule for years. 
   A few of us stood up on the House floor that afternoon and explained how we thought it was wrong. In the next session of Congress, the rules were changed. Afterwards, all conferences were totally open to the public. 
   I know some Members of Congress don't like that. They do not like the sun shining in conferences. But that was the rule. We started it back then. I think it is in the public interest. It is a good rule. 
   It seems things have changed slowly; conferences should not be secret. They are bipartisan. Both political parties attend, but often the minority party is shut out. One wonders what is happening. The real danger is, if and when the Democrats are in the majority, the Democrats are going to be tempted to do the same thing. It is wrong. Neither side should do that. They should be  much more open and much more closely should enforce that rule, and matters not pertaining to the conference should not be included in the conference report. It is something we have to stand up and enforce for the good of the Senate and for the good of the country; otherwise, there will be chaos, or anarchy, or a dictatorship--whatever it is. 
   Based upon the comments of my good friend, I am very inclined to work with him next year to see if we can do something about that. I think there are many others in the Senate who share the same view. It has gotten out of hand. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa for the statement.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few words on a matter that will be coming before this body, I hope, later this week; that is, beginning the process of the United States agreeing to extend permanent normal trading relations status with China. 
   I would like to step back for a few moments and reflect a bit on its significance and on its implications. The irony is that we are even talking about this today because I think the bill to grant China PNTR has the strong support of at least three-fourths of the Senate. It is deeply in our national interest. I wish it had been passed some time ago. Actually, we should have passed it months ago. Instead, we have had to struggle to find time to consider it in this chamber. We are now approaching the eleventh hour of this session of Congress with a week left this month and a few weeks in September. 
   I personally believe this issue should have been handled differently. We should have brought it up much earlier. But later is better than never. I am glad we are finally approaching the denouement. 
   For over two millennia, China was ruled by a series of imperial dynasties. The last Emperor was overthrown in 1912. Warlords, dictators, and the Japanese military then took over parts of the country at various times. 
   In 1949, the Chinese Communists took control of the entire Chinese mainland. Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters were forced to flee to Taiwan. Then followed three decades of absolute, totalitarian, Communist rule by Mao Zedong. 
   To oversimplify, in 1979, Deng Xiaoping signaled the beginning of the end of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology as the underlying construct of the Chinese economy, polity, and society. 
   Another critical turning point was Deng's so-called ``Southern Journey'' in 1992. He visited Shenzhen, other parts of Guangdong Province, and Shanghai. On that journey, he advocated more economic openness, faster growth, and more rapid progress toward a market-based economy. 
   For the next two decades, we witnessed both progress and retreat in China's economic and political developments. Dramatic opening to foreign products and foreign investment. Yet a continuing government effort to maintain control over telecommunications. 
   The massacre of students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Yet relatively unfettered access today by many Chinese to the Internet. Repeated violations of contract sanctity. Yet the development of domestic stock markets and Chinese companies placing issues on foreign stock exchanges. 
   The battle in China between the forces of reform and the forces of reaction continues. No one can predict how it will end, or when. But it is certainly in the vital interest of the United States to do everything we can to support those who favor reform over totalitarianism. Those who favor private enterprise over state-owned enterprises. 
   That means we must work to incorporate China into the international community. We need to engage China with the goal of promoting responsible behavior internally and externally. Encouraging them to play by international rules. Integrating the Chinese economy into the market-driven, middle-class, participatory economies of the West. 
   Economic reforms never have an easy time. And the forces in China that want to maintain the status quo are strong. 
   But, economic reform, moving to a market economy, transparency, direct foreign investment, listing of companies on overseas markets. Progress in all these areas is of vital importance to the United States as they relate to stability in China, accountability, and the development of a middle class. China's entry into the WTO will help anchor and sustain these economic reform efforts and empower economic reformers. China will not become a market-driven economy overnight. But it is in our interest that they move in this direction. And the WTO will help the process. 
   Around the world, we have seen that economic growth leads to the development of a large and strong middle class. Eventually, the middle class makes demands on political leaders for greater participation, accountability, and openness. It takes time. For example, eighty years ago, the Kuomintang, the KMT, was created by the same Soviet advisors who created the Chinese Communist Party. Fifty years ago, the KMT massacred Taiwanese citizens. Twenty years ago, the KMT still ruled Taiwan under martial law. Yet Taiwan just held its second truly democratic election. 
   There are many other examples. Look at Korea. A quarter of a century ago, the Korean government tried to murder the dissident Kim Dae Jung. Now, President Kim Dae Jung has begun to transform Korea's economic structure. He has traveled to Pyongyang in one of the most remarkable initiatives in modern world history. He is worried about being turned out of office in the next democratic election; such is the way of democracy. 
   The Philippines in 1986, Thailand in 1990, Indonesia in 1999. They all showed us the power of the development of a middle class. There is nothing fundamentally unique about China that makes a similar type of change impossible, or even improbable, over time. 
   Once China joins the WTO, China will be accountable for its behavior to the outside world, for perhaps the first time in history. The dispute settlement system at the WTO is far from perfect. Many members are working to open up dispute settlements and make it more available to the outside world. I have been among its most vociferous critics. But WTO dispute settlement will allow other countries to examine Chinese domestic economic practices. 
   It will force China to explain actions that other members believe violate global rules for the first time in world history. When a violation is found, it will put pressure on China to change and comply with the internationally accepted rules of the WTO. Not a perfect organization, but certainly better than none. This type of external scrutiny of China is virtually unprecedented. It has implications that may go far beyond trade, as China learns about the need to respect the rule of law among nations. 
   Let me turn to Taiwan for a moment. Taiwan will accede to the WTO very shortly after China does. What will happen when both enjoy full membership? 
   They will participate together, along with all other WTO members, in meetings ranging from detailed technical sessions to Ministerial level gatherings. There will be countless opportunities for interaction at many levels. Under the WTO's most-favored-nation rule, they will have to provide each other the same benefits that they grant to all other members. That is a very important principle. Taiwan's current policy limiting direct transportation, communication, and investment with the mainland will not stand up to WTO scrutiny. Each will be able to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism against the other. They will have to meet directly and deal with economic differences in a peaceful way. 
   Presumably, either could take reservations, such as a national security exception, against the other in certain areas. That is a decision still to be made. But, no matter what, membership in the WTO and WTO-induced liberalization will increase and deepen ties between Taiwan and the PRC in trade, investment, technology, transportation, information, communications, and travel. And that has to contribute to the maintenance of peace across the Taiwan Strait. 
   China is emerging from one hundred and fifty years of national torpor. How we in America, and how the leadership in China, manage this relationship will  set the stage for regional and global politics, security, and economics for decades to come. 
   We must make a profound choice. Do we bring China into the orbit of the global trading community with its rule of law? Or do we choose to isolate and contain China, creating a 21st century version of the cold war in Asia? 
   It is a truism in international relations that rising powers have proven to be the most dangerous. Germany at the end of the 1800s and the Soviet Union in the 1940s. But this is not 1900 or 1945. As the world has become smaller for us because of revolutions in information, transportation, and production, so for China has the world come closer. 
   China is not our enemy. China is not our friend. The issue for us is how to engage China, and this means engagement with no illusions. Engagement with a purpose. How do we steer China's energies into productive, peaceful and stable relationships within the region and globally? For just as we isolate China at our peril, we engage them to our advantage. 
   Incorporation of China into the WTO, and that includes granting them PNTR, is a national imperative for the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this issue is really quite simple. It is unfortunate that it has been confused by lots of statements, which are somewhat true but not entirely true. 
   The goal here is to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Remember, there is nothing in the code that we enacted to create the penalty. It was not an intentional act. It is just a consequence of the way the code has worked. It is a necessary consequence if we want to have progressive tax rates and also have the same taxation for American citizens with the same income. 
   We also have to remind ourselves that there is a bonus in the Tax Code; that is, certain people who get married get a bonus. In fact, there are more taxpayers receiving a bonus than there are taxpayers who receive a penalty. That is indisputable. That is a solid fact. But we are here to try to find a way to help eliminate the marriage tax penalty for those who get a penalty as a consequence of getting married. 
   There are two approaches here. One is the approach by the majority, and one is the approach by the Democratic side of the aisle. The majority eliminates only 3 of the 65 provisions in this code that create a penalty--only 3. The Democratic proposal eliminates them all, all 65. There is a big difference between the two. 
   In the Democratic alternative, taxpayers have the right to choose. They can choose which way to file their taxes so it benefits them. On the majority side, the taxpayer does not have a choice. That is just the way it is. 
   I might also say, if we say we are going to pass marriage tax penalty relief, we should pass marriage tax penalty relief. That is what the Democrats have tried to do. The Republicans are doing some of that--albeit only 3 out of the 65--but they are also giving a tax cut, irrespective of marriage, which widens the disparity between married couples and singles. 
   A lot of single people in this country, when they see what is passed by the majority party, are going to wonder what in the world is happening. Why are we giving the 60 percent of married people who don't even have a marriage penalty such a big tax break and not giving a tax break to them simply because they are single? That is not fair at all. Again, the Democratic proposal says, we will give a break, a true break for marriage, but not widen the discrepancy between marrieds and singles. 
   The long and short is, we have a conference report. The battle has been waged and the battle is over.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that has happened under this Republican majority. 
   To sum it up, Mr. President, we on this side are definitely for tax cuts, very significant tax cuts. We are for eliminating entirely the marriage tax penalty. We want to reduce the Federal estate tax dramatically. But it is unfortunate that the conference report before us goes way too far. It is unbalanced. It is unfair. If the American people truly see all the components of it, compare it to all the other tax provisions going through here, I think they will say: Wait a minute, this is kind of a funny thing the Congress is doing. It is not what they say it is. Why don't they fess up and be honest and say what is really in the conference report. 
   That is sometimes the way this place operates. It is up to us on this side of the aisle to get the facts out, to allow more sun to shine on the conference report so that more married American people will know exactly what is in it. 
   I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>106-baucus-mt-2-20000720</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have two amendments, one of which I am not going to offer. 
   I have an amendment which establishes the Trade Injury Compensation Act of 2000. This measure is identical to my bill, S. 2709, which enjoys wide bipartisan support by my fellow members of Senate Beef Caucus and has already been referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund to help the United States cattle industry withstand the European Union's illegal ban on beef treated with hormones. 
   Over a year ago, the World Trade Organization endorsed retaliation when the EU refused to open to American beef. Since that time, the EU has continued to stall in its compliance which is frankly, outrageous. For over a decade we've fought the beef battle. Now its time to try something new to help producers who continue to be injured by the ban. 
   The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using the tariffs imposed on the EU to directly aid U.S. beef producers. Normally, the additional tariff revenues received from retaliation go to the Treasury. This bill establishes a trust fund so that the affected industry will receive those revenues as compensation for its injury. 
   Mr. President, my amendment creates a fund which provides assistance to United States beef producers to improve the quality of beef produced in the United States; and provides assistance to United States beef producers in market development, consumer education, and promotion of the beef industry in overseas markets. 
   The Secretary of the Treasury shall cease the transfer of funds equivalent to the duties on the beef retaliation list only when the European Union complies with the World Trade Organization ruling allowing United States beef producers access to the European market. 
   In a perfect world we would not need this amendment because the European Union would abide by its international trade commitments. And it is still my hope that the European Union simply comply with the WTO Dispute Settlement rulings and allow our beef to enter its borders. 
   Mr. President, the WTO is a critically important institution that sets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow. 
   We all recognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of my colleagues, are working on ways to fix it. We must bring credibility and compliance to the system. The Trade Injury Compensation Act will give some relief to our producers as we strive toward this endeavor. 
   Mr. President, I realize that we still have work to do in perfecting this amendment. That is why I appreciate my colleague Senator LUGAR's commitment to allow an Agriculture Subcommittee hearing on this bill in September. 
   In light of that impending hearing, I will not offer the amendment at this time. 
   Time is of the essence for our producers who have been injured by the European Union. I look forward to this hearing and further expeditious action in this matter.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to by my good friend, the ever gracious senior Senator from North Carolina. 
   The amendment strikes the provision in the bill that transfers portions of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps of Engineers. It also requires the Army Corps to conduct a study within 180 days of alternatives, including nonstructural alternatives, to the currently authorized inlet stabilization project at Oregon Inlet. This study would have to take into account objectives in addition to navigation, such as the policies of the State of North Carolina regarding construction of structural measures along the coast and minimizing adverse impacts to the national seashore and the wildlife refuge. Most importantly, the study would have to develop recommendations to meet those objectives. I hope this study will provide a sound basis on which Congress can resolve this issue. 
   I believe this amendment will be fair to the people of North Carolina and also to the American taxpayers. 
   The senior Senator from North Carolina has been very helpful in working out this amendment. I appreciate his efforts. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, my amendment would replace section 3104 of the bill, which transfers land from the Interior Department of the Corps of Engineers in order to circumvent environmental rules and promote the construction of a system of jetties at Oregon Inlet in North Carolina. 
   Some background about the Oregon Inlet project. 
   At the outset, let me acknowledge the obvious. I'm no expert about Oregon Inlet. 
   Senator HELMS is. He has been working on this issue for at least 30 years. 
   I am simply trying to react to an appropriations rider by mustering the facts as well as I can. 
   Oregon Inlet is on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, near Roanoke Island. It is the only inlet between Cape Henry, Virginia, 45 miles to the north and Cape Hatteras, 85 miles to the south. 
   Like much of the Outer Banks, the Inlet is a dynamic ecosystem, with high waves, swift currents, and a rapidly shifting sandbar at the mouth of the Inlet. 
   Make no mistake. It is treacherous water. Between 1965 and 1995, more than 20 ships sank or ran aground, with the loss of 22 lives. 
   I should not, though, that all but one of the deaths occurred before the early 1980s, when the Corps began a dredging program. 
   In 1970, at the urging of Senator HELMS, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the Corps of Engineers to construct a jetty system at Oregon Inlet. 
   Specifically, the Corps was directed to deepen the navigation channel through the Inlet from 14 feet to 20 feet and to maintain that channel with two jetties. 
   It gets more complicated. And much has changed since 1970. 
   The jetties would prevent the natural flow of sand from north to south. That flow is what replenishes Pea Island, a national wildlife refuge which otherwise would erode. 
   To counteract this effect, the system includes a system of pipes and pumps that will transport 2 million cubic feet of sand each year. 
   All told the project will cost American taxpayers $108 million to construct and about $6 million a year to maintain. We all know it will cost more than that. 
   The project would be built on: The northern part, on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore; and the southern part on the Pea Island Wildlife Refuge. 
   Therefore, before the Corps can build the project, it must get permits from the Interior Department, confirming that the project will be compatible with the Seashore and the Refuge. 
   The provision that has been included in the Agriculture appropriations bill, as section 3104, effectively eliminates this permit requirement. It transfers the land from the Interior Department to the Corps, so that permits no longer are necessary. 
   Those are the basic facts. 
   Now, some of you listening may be scratching your head, wondering what's going on here. After all, the project was authorized in 1970. Thirty years later, it still hasn't been built. That, you might be thinking, is unacceptable. It's probably because of Government red tape. 
   Maybe it's high time we cut through all the red tape and move this project along, as the bill would do. 
   An understandable reaction, if you just look at this on the surface. But, as is often the case, if you dig a little deeper, and get past the surface, it's not that simple. 
   The principal reason that the project has not been built is that the project is very questionable and very controversial. Many have argued that the project will cause great environmental harm and waste more than one hundred million dollars of taxpayers' money. 
   Time after time, Interior Secretaries have refused to grant the necessary permits. Including I should note, President Reagan's Interior Secretary, James Watt. 
   The only exception was when Secretary Lujan granted a permit towards the end of the Bush Administration. Soon after taking office, Secretary Babbitt reversed the decision. 
   Also time after time, the environmental impact statements developed by the Corps have been found to be inadequate, and the Corps has been sent back to the drawing board. 
   As we speak, the process continues. The Corps has been asked to revise its latest Environmental Impact Statement, to address what the National Marine Fisheries Service called ``significant errors and inadequacies.'' 
   As I understand it, the revised EIS will be submitted to Corps headquarters around the end of this month and issued in August. 
   After that, the Corps can move ahead and again seek permits from the Interior Department. If there is a dispute, it will be resolved by the White House. 
   Section 3104 of the bill circumvents this process by transferring the land and therefore eliminating the need for any permits. 
   Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the concerns of Senator HELMS and others who support this project. I know that they're frustrated that this project has drawn on too long. 
   But I believe that the approach taken in the bill has four main faults. 
   The first goes to process. The provision in the bill is, simply put, a rider. It is authorizing legislation, properly within the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   This is a controversial issue; it has been debated, back and forth, for thirty years. It should be resolved on the merits, with input from the committee of jurisdiction. It should not be resolved as a rider on an unrelated appropriations bill. 
   The second fault is that the bill may cause serious environmental harm. 
   This is, again, a dynamic ecosystem. Always shifting. Always changing. 
   As this chart shows, there have been major changes in the geography of Oregon Inlet over the years. The Inlet itself has shifted south by about 80 feet a year, which amounts to more than two miles since the Inlet opened in 1848. 
   In the middle of this dynamic, shifting system, the project would construct a pair of rock jetties that are a total of more than 3 miles long. 
   That poses two big risks. 
   In the first place, we'll be altering the natural system by which the ocean erodes and then replenishes the barrier islands along the coast. 
   As it now stands, each year, tons of sand shift, mostly from north to south, replenishing Pea Island. The jetties will block most of that sand from shifting naturally. To compensate, the Corps plans to pump about 2 million  cubic feet of sand each year, that will be trapped above the north jetty, through a large pipeline, and unload it below the south jetty. 
   Maybe it will work. But what if it doesn't? 
   Consider what happened on Assateague Island. 60 years ago, we constructed a jetty. It blocked the sand from replenishing the southern part of the island. Since then, the coastline has eroded about one-half mile. 
   Another thing. We'll alter the natural flow of water through what is now a broad, relatively shallow inlet leading to Albermarle and Pamlico Sounds. The Sounds contain important and productive habitats for several species of fish, including Spanish mackerel, Atlantic croaker, and gray trout. 
   These fish spawn at sea. The larval fish then migrate into the calm waters of the sounds where they grow until they're strong enough to return to the ocean. 
   It is not at all clear that these fish will be able to make it through the jetties. The fishery biologists just aren't sure. 
   So we are taking major environmental risks. 
   The third major fault is that the economics don't add up. 
   True, the Corps projects an economic benefit, of about $37 million over a 50 year period. 
   However, as we all know, the Corps' economic analysis has come under heavy criticism lately. 
   In any event, many people have questioned the Corps' estimate of the cost and benefits of this project 
   I am not talking about environmental groups, which, it might be argued, have their own agenda. 
   I am talking about Taxpayers for Common Sense, and several distinguished economists who have studied the project. 
   For example, Professor Richard Seldon, who I understand is a distinguished professor emiritus at the University of Virginia, said this:  
   My extremely conservative analysis of the Corps' data found that rather than the almost $37 million of net benefits claimed for the project by the Corps ..... this project will have negative benefits of [more than $4 million]. In fact, I believe the project is very likely to have a much worse return on investment based on many costs thus far not accounted for by the Corps.  
   In a letter sent to Senator HELMS a few days ago, Professor Emeritus Seldon said.  
   I am convinced that these jetties should not be built--not for environmental reasons but simply because the benefits claimed by the Corps are nowhere near as large as the likely cost to taxpayers. This is a bad economic deal, even if we forget about the environment.  
   The fourth fault is that I believe there's a better way. 
   Let me say again that I understand the frustration that Senator HELMS and others in North Carolina feel about this project. 
   They have serious concerns. One is safety. Again, these are treacherous waters. 
   Another is economic development. As I understand it, this is an area that could use the economic boost that increased fish landings might provide. 
   I'm not going to stand here and say that environmental concerns should prevail over safety and economic development. Not a all. 
   I don't buy that, whether we're talking about Montana, North Carolina, or anyplace else. We have to strike a balance. 
   But here is the rub. There may be a better way. 
   We may be able to achieve all the benefits that would be achieved by constructing the jetties, and do it much more cheaply and without the environmental risks. 
   Here is how. By dredging a better channel. 
   We could direct the Corps to dredge the Inlet deeper and more often. 
   But there is a problem. In the most recent EIs the Corps has studied only one non-structural alternative. One that would have more than doubled this width of the channel. It's no surprise that the costs out-weighed the benefits. So, for at least 30 years, we haven't fully considered whether there's a better alternative to the jetty system. 
   In addition there are many more factors to consider--environmental, recreational, and so forth--then there were in 1970. 
   That brings me to my amendment. 
   It deletes the provision in the bill that transfers the land, thereby circumventing the permitting process. 
   Instead, the amendment requires that, within 180 days the Corps, must evaluate alternatives to the jetty project, including dredging. 
   In doing so, the Corps must consider the views of affected interests, must consider how various alternatives accord with North Carolina's shoreline protection laws, and must minimize adverse environmental effects. 
   Mr. President, pulling this all together, we need to do more to improve safety at Oregon Inlet. 
   But the jetty system that we authorized in 1970 is an idea whose time has probably gone. 
   We do not need 3 miles of granite rock jetties. We don't need 2 miles of pipeline, to pump 2 million cubic feet of sand every year. 
   We do not need huge environmental risks. 
   We don't need to ask taxpayers to fork over $108 million. 
   Instead, we should step back, take stock, and see whether we can solve the problems at Oregon Inlet in a way that avoids big environmental risks and saves taxpayers' money. 
   Therefore, I urge colleagues to support my amendment.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment that Senator BURNS and I were working with the Committee on in this Agriculture Appropriations bill that would  help Montana's senior citizens and low-income citizens. In particular, this measure would provide an additional $500,000 to enable the State of Montana continue its food stamp program standard utility allowance (``SUA'') waiver. Montana is currently operating under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue extending the waiver. 
   Montana has approximately 25,000 households using food stamps. Of this number, over 19,000 would be tragically affected by the loss of this waiver. For example, many elderly food stamp recipients who live on fixed incomes and/or reside in public housing would be hard hit be the loss of the Standard Utility Allowance waiver. In many such cases, records from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services indicate that the loss could be higher than fifty percent of the benefit. 
   Second, the state of Montana is currently serving 952 ``able-bodied adults without dependents.'' Many of these are either homeless or at risk of losing their housing. Decreasing their current food stamp benefit would only exacerbate their difficult situations. 
   Finally, many of these food stamp recipients live in Montana's 634 group homes for the disabled. The loss of the Standard Utility Allowance would decrease food stamps for these individuals with disabilities creating further hardship for group homes which already operate with very little budget flexibility. 
   The entire Montana delegation has worked hard over the past two years in conjunction with our Montana Department of Public Health and Human Service, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget to maintain this critical program. I am pleased that Senator COCHRAN is willing to work with Senator BURNS and myself to address this issue within the context of this Agriculture Appropriations bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to pay tribute to PAUL COVERDELL. I have listened to a lot of tributes today. There have been so many themes, including cheerfulness, optimism, a welcome hand, no rancor, no bitterness. We all know that to be PAUL COVERDELL. I want that to mention one incident which, for me, encapsulates it all. It is going to be the incident that is defining for me. Whenever I think of PAUL, I will always think of this incident, and I always will. 
   This outfit--the Senate--tends to be a little partisan. Over the years, it has become too partisan, almost as two armed camps, one over there and one over here. It is regrettable, but that is something that has occurred and evolved up here in the Senate. 
   Not too many years ago, I was in Atlanta, GA, speaking at an event. I neglected, as is a common courtesy, to tell Senator COVERDELL I was there. Sam Nunn was a Senator at the time. I didn't tell PAUL I was having an event in Georgia, his home State. I felt kind of bad about it. But like a lot of us, I kind of pushed it to the side and rationalized that it was not that important. 
   Lo and behold, at that same hotel, PAUL was speaking about three or four rooms away, and I heard about it. I said to myself: Oh, my gosh, MAX, how stupid you are; why didn't you tell him? How guilty I felt. Oh, my gosh, here I am in PAUL'S home State and he doesn't even know I am here. I am in his State and he is just down the hall. I thought: You blew it, MAX. 
   When I finished, I was walking out in the hall and PAUL happened to be coming up. He bounced up to me and said, ``Hey, MAX, how are you? Welcome to Georgia. I hope you're having a good time.'' 
   That was PAUL--positive, upbeat, cheerful, with a smile and a good attitude and a gleam in his eye. That made me feel even smaller and more guilty, but it made me feel even better about PAUL. That is the PAUL COVERDELL I will always remember. 
   Mr. President, Wanda and I send our deepest sympathies to Nancy and the family. Life is fickle, unpredictable. There but for the grace of God go any of us. People with the personal qualities of PAUL COVERDELL are the ones we will treasure here. I know the people of Georgia will treasure the same qualities in PAUL COVERDELL. He was a great man. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on the issue of snowmobiling in Yellowstone. 
   It is pretty clear to anyone who has visited Yellowstone during the winter that changes need to be made to protect the park. I have met with folks on all sides of this issue, and I think that most people agree that the noise, air pollution and wildlife impacts are unacceptable and have to be addressed. 
   Yellowstone is the engine for local economies and is part of our national heritage. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to make sure that we don't harm the park and its wildlife. 
   That having been said, I don't think we need an outright ban. I believe that we can protect the park and its wildlife in other ways. Already, people have put forth a number of creative alternatives to meet these goals, including limiting the number of snowmobiles allowed in the park, requiring clean and quiet machines, and using guided tours. 
   I think we need to explore all these alternatives and work together to strike a common-sense balance that best serves Yellowstone and Montana. A balance that protects the Park, the local economies and involves people on all sides of this issue. 
   As my colleagues in this body know, I am not in favor of legislating on appropriations bills. I am pleased that the Senate has decided to not pursue that route for the time being. It is my hope that the current administrative process that is underway for Yellowstone will produce an administrative compromise that protects Yellowstone National Park and provides for a broad range of visitor uses of the Park.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman SMITH and  others to introduce the ``National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial Commemoration Act of 2000.'' 
   First established by that great conservation leader, President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903, the National Wildlife Refuge System has grown today to be the premier system of reserves for the conservation of wildlife habitat and biological diversity in the world. 
   There are more than 500 refuges today, supporting over 1500 vertebrate species and thousands of species of plants. Open to the public, these refuges are the focal point of thousands of visitors each year that participate in wildlife viewing, photography, hunting, fishing or biking. They are places where families go to introduce youngsters to nature and to teach them the meaning of stewardship. 
   In some cases, refuges provide the last habitats for endangered species. In all cases, the nearly 93 million acres in the National Wildlife Refuge system provide special places for wildlife, fish, plants and people. These lands provide a buffer against ever-increasing development and are reserved for future generations to enjoy and learn from. 
   In Montana, we have seven National Wildlife Refuges including the 2,800 acre Lee Metcalf Refuge, the 15,500 acre Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge in the Central Flyway, and the National Bison Range, originally set aside to protect the last of the great bison herds. 
   Mr. President, the bill that we are introducing today will celebrate the last 100 years of the National Wildlife Refuge System on Mary 14, 2003. In addition, the bill establishes a commission to look ahead and plan for the future, including a review of the backlog of maintenance needs at our refuges. It is my hope that this bill will increase public awareness and understanding of these national treasures. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Moynihan amendment, which provides an alternative form of marriage penalty relief. 
   I do so for two main reasons. 
   First, unlike the bill, the Democratic alternative completely eliminates the marriage penalty, by giving taxpayers the choice whether to file their taxes individually or jointly. 
   Second, unlike the bill, the Democratic alternative only addresses the marriage penalty, rather than providing a more general tax cut that benefits some people but not others. In that sense, it's a replay of yesterday's debate, about estate taxes. By concentrating on the real problem, the Democratic alternative leaves resources available for other pressing national needs. 
   Before going into these arguments in more detail, I'd provide a little background. 
   From some of the debate that we've heard over the past months, you'd think that the proponents of committee bill are only ones in favor of marriage. 
   But as is usually the case, it's not that simple. In fact, the taxation of married couples presents some complex issues, requiring careful thought. 
   After all, the so-called ``marriage penalty'' is not some devilish concoction designed to discourage marriage and reward sinners. 
   It is, instead, a reflection of some difficult choices that have been made. We have to decide how to tax married couples compared to individuals, and we have to decide whether couples that earn the same amount of income, but in different proportions between the husband and wife, should be taxed differently. 
   These are not easy issues. They don't have pat, obvious answers. And, when you try to solve one problem, you often create another. 
   Congress has wrestled with these questions before. Up until 1948, married people filed taxes individually. That created problems. Among other things, the Supreme Court held that the IRS must give effect to state community property laws. As a result, couples were taxes differently depending on how different state community property laws allocated income between spouses. If a couple lived in a common law state, they may have had to pay higher taxes than a couple with the same income between spouses. If a couple lived in a common law state, they may have had to pay higher taxes than a couple with the same income who lived in a community property state. 
   In 1948, Congress addressed this by allowing all married couples to file joint returns. Congress set the personal exemption, standard deduction, and ``rate breaks'' for couples at twice those for individuals. For some couples, that created the so-called ``marriage bonus''. For example, if one spouse earned 100 percent of the income, the couple would probably pay lower taxes after marriage, because the income would be split evenly between the two spouses, and they would benefit from lower tax rates. 
   In 1969, Congress decided that this system treated individuals unfairly. 
   The Senate Finance Committee report said that ``the tax rates imposed on single persons are too heavy relative to those imposed on married couples at the same income level ..... While some difference between the rate of tax paid by single persons and joint returns is appropriate to reflect the additional living expenses of married taxpayers, the existing differential of as much as 41 percent which results from income splitting cannot be justified.'' 
   So in 1969, Congress adjusted the rate schedules, setting the rate breaks for individuals at about 60 percent of those for couples, rather than 50 percent. That addressed the perceived unfairness to individuals. 
   But it resulted in some couples paying higher taxes after they marry--the marriage penalty. 
   We've pretty much stuck with that system ever since, through Democratic and Republican Administrations, when Democrats were in the Senate majority and when Republicans were in the Senate majority. 
   In recent years, however, some things have changes, that have made the taxation of married couples a bigger issue. 
   First of all, as we've added more credits, deductions, and exclusions to the Tax Code, each has included it's own ``marriage penalty,'' because there's a separate rate schedule for individuals and married couples. 
   For example, the 1997 tax bill, sponsored primarily by Republicans, made two noteworthy additions to the marriage penalty. The first is the child tax credit. The phase out for this credit begins a $110,000 of adjusted gross income for joint return filers, but at $75,000 for unmarried parents, creating both a marriage bonus for sole earner couples and a marriage penalty for dual earner couples. 
   The second is the phaseouts of the deduction for interest on student loans. The phaseout for this deduction begins at $40,000 for unmarried individuals and at $60,000 for joint return filers. Like the child credit phaseout, it creates a marriage bonus for one earner couples and a marriage penalty for two earner couples. 
   So the issue has become compounded by all of our tinkering with the Code. 
   In addition, there's been a demographic shift. More couples today are two earner couples than there were three decades ago. So more couples today face a marriage penalty than a bonus. 
   Pulling this together, the marriage penalty is not intentional. It's not designed to penalize marriage. It's a natural consequence of some rational decisions. 
   But it's still a problem, both in fact and in the eyes of the American people. 
   And it's a problem that we should do something about. But we should all understand that there is no ``magic bullet'' that will solve the problem without potentially creating others. We must make some tough choices. 
   That brings me to the committee bill. 
   It has some good features, including the provisions regarding the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit. 
   But is also has several flaws. 
   Most important of these, the bill isn't a ``marriage penalty'' proposal at all. 
   Let's have a little truth in advertising. Let's tell people what's really going on. This isn't a marriage penalty bill. It's a tax cut, disguised as a marriage penalty bill. 
   More than half of the tax cut goes to couples who don't face a marriage penalty, or to individuals who pay the alternative minimum tax. 
   It's really more like a broad-based tax cut, at least for married couples and some individuals.  
   That kind of a tax cut may or may not be a good idea, compared to other priorities. But let's be clear. The Chairman's bill is not simply a bill to reduce the marriage penalty. 
   Viewed not as a marriage penalty bill, but as a tax cut, it's arbitrary--there's no particular rhyme or reason to it. If you're married and pay a marriage penalty, you get a tax cut. If you're married and don't pay a marriage penalty, you also get a tax cut. And if you're married and get a tax bonus, you still get a tax cut. 
   If you're single, you get no tax cut. In fact, the disparity between married and single taxpayers widens, to where is was before 1969. 
   Think about it. If you're married, with no kids, and you're already receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut. 
   If, on the other hand, you're a single mom with three kids, struggling to make end meet, you get no tax cut. Zero 
   The Democratic alternative, on the other hand, is more fair and more logical. You only get a tax cut if you have a marriage penalty. And if you have a marriage penalty, the Democratic alternative completely eliminates it. Not partial relief. Complete elimination. 
   You won't have to worry about the marriage penalty in the student loan deduction, or in Social Security benefits, or in any of the 65 separate marriage penalties that have crept into the Tax Code over the years. The Democratic alternative eliminates all of them at one time. 
   And it does so in a way most taxpayers can understand--if they save more in taxes by filing as individuals, that is what they're allowed to do. It's their choice how they file their returns. Taxpayers in a number of states, including my own home state of Montana, already have this option and it saves them millions of dollars in taxes. 
   Mr. President, let's eliminate the marriage penalty, not just provide some relief from it. 
   And let's do it by empowering taxpayers to make the choice about how they file their taxes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic alternative.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 74, The Paycheck Fairness Act. Over 30 years ago, President John Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law. At that time women were making only 61 cents for every dollar that was earned by a man. Since that time, we have made significant strides to ensure equality in the workplace, however, the disparity in wages between men and women still exists. 
   Today, as a nation, women earn 74 cents for every dollar that a man earns. In Montana, the difference is even more significant, women are earning only 69 cents for every dollar that is earned by a man. This translates into more than $5,000 a year. This is unacceptable. We must have pay equity. 
   In our state, and the country as a whole, women work a variety of jobs, from minimum wage jobs, to women who run their own businesses. The work that women do is not adequately reflected in the wages that they earn. 
   In Montana we are faced with a unique situation--we are ranked almost last in per capita income. The economic boom that has created tremendous wealth on Wall Street hasn't echoed on Main Street, Montana. It is necessary to invest our resources to maintain our quality of life while creating good jobs and boosting our working families standard of living. If women were paid equitably, Montana families would greatly benefit. Family incomes would rise and, poverty rates would fall. 
   Mr. President, pay equity is not the entire solution to the economic development challenge. It is part of a package, we must also invest in and protect our small businesses. After all, small business is the backbone of our economy. In order to improve jobs and wages in Montana and in the nation, we must maintain our educational systems. When we make additional investments in education and job training, we can attract new businesses to our state, increase our wages, and prepare our children for the jobs of tomorrow. 
   If we are willing to do these things, economic growth will improve the quality of life for all men and women of Montana.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Paul Hatfield. Last week, Montana lost not only a great man, but a dedicated and passionate public servant who spent most of his life committed to working for the people of our state and our nation. 
   A native Montanan, Paul Hatfield was born and raised in Great Falls, where he graduated from the local high school in 1947 and pursued pre-law studies at the College of Great Falls. His education was interrupted by two years of service in the U.S. Army, including overseas duty with the Signal Corps during the Korean conflict. 
   In 1953, Paul returned home and entered the University of Montana Law school, After several years in private practice, he was appointed Chief Deputy Attorney for Cascade County, serving until his election as 8th Judicial District judge in 1960. He held this post with honor and distinction for the next sixteen years. Heeding the call for public service, he was elected Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, moving to Helena to assume his new duties in January 1977. 
   When Senator Lee Metcalf passed away on January 12, 1978, Judge Hatfield was the Governor's choice to complete the remaining year of that term. During his tenure in the Senate, Hatfield served on the Armed Services and Judiciary Committees. In 1978, Judge Hatfield and I both ran for the Democratic nomination for the opportunity to represent Montana in the United States Senate. Paul campaigned as a man of integrity. He was always gracious and principled. Following the election, we remained friends and I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for him. 
   While already having a distinguished career, Judge Hatfield was not yet done with public service. In 1979, he was appointed to serve on the Federal District bench by President Carter. Although Hatfield took senior status in 1995, he continued to serve actively in the courtroom until the time of his death. 
   Mr. President, as I have said, Paul Hatfield was an incredibly gracious man. His dedication was apparent through his long career as a public servant and his commitment to his faith. He was full of charisma as everyone who came into contact with him would attest to. Paul Hatfield was a treasure to our state and to this nation and he will be greatly missed.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will start by complimenting the two leaders. Yesterday at this time, we were facing a likely cloture petition which would have severely limited debate on different amendments. We finally reached agreement on a certain number of amendments. It is good we have crossed that bridge and are now on the bill. 
   Some of the amendments that are going to be offered today may be adopted--some may not--but at least they will all improve the bill. We will have an open debate on them, and that allows the American people to have a better opportunity to determine what makes sense and what does not. Again, I congratulate the leaders. 
   The House bill still raises many serious questions that deserve careful consideration. I will name a few. 
   One is the impact of the House bill across various income levels, something that has really not been discussed. How does it affect one income level versus another income level versus the highest income levels in America? 
   Another is the new rules that maintain the carryover basis of certain inherited assets. What is all that about? It is kind of technical. The fact is, under the House bill--remember, the House bill doesn't repeal the estate tax until 10 years after enactment--there is not much relief in the first 10 years. But after 10 years, after the estate tax is repealed, many assets will no longer have a stepped up basis but instead have a carryover basis. 
   What does someone who inherits an asset and wants to then dispose of that asset have to do? He or she cannot just figure out how much tax is owed by using the ordinary market value when it was inherited, which presumably is quite a bit higher than when it was  bought. Rather, he or she has to use the carryover basis from when the asset was first acquired with whatever adjustments were made in the meantime. This is usually much lower. And it is awfully technical. 
   The net effect is twofold: One is that people who receive an inheritance, under the House bill, are going to suddenly face a much higher capital gains tax if and when they want to dispose of it than they would under current law. Under current law, again, it is called a stepped-up basis. The net effect is a much lower capital gains tax when the asset might otherwise be sold. 
   All you folks who think, boy, this House bill is going to repeal the estate tax, beware. It does not really repeal the estate tax. What it does is say that 10 years later, when you get that asset, if you want to do anything with it, if you want to sell it, want to realize the value of it, you will pay a whopping capital gains tax, much higher than you would otherwise pay under current law. 
   The second problem with that is the complexity of the paperwork. Let's assume the House bill passes. After 10 years --you are a person who receives inheritance from an estate. If you have to go back and figure out what the basis of all the assets are, some assets may have been acquired by the decedent 5 years earlier, 10 years earlier, maybe 20 years earlier, maybe 30 years earlier. The basis may have to be carried over for generations. If you have to stop and find the paperwork, find the data which determines what the cost was of that asset from who knows how many years ago, that is a huge change from current law. It will cause undue complexity. 
   A lot of people in this body correctly complain about the complexity of the Tax Code. That is a valid complaint. If the House bill passes, the additional complexity that this body will impose on taxpayers is going to be beyond imagination. When this Congress did the same thing about 24 years ago, in 1976, guess what happened. Our own constituents raised a huge outcry. What did we do in the Congress? We agreed with our folks. 
   We ended up repealing carryover basis before it even took effect. I don't think many people have focused on it, but that same provision is in the House bill right now, the bill we have before us. 
   Then there is the effect of the House bill on charitable giving, when the estate tax is totally repealed on down the road after 10 years. I have talked to a lot of estate tax attorneys--reasonable people, good, solid estate tax attorneys. They say: Max, if you pass a total repeal, I guarantee you there will be a huge drop in charitable contributions in America--huge. It stands to reason. 
   Think of some taxpayers who have been in the news a lot, some Americans who have huge estates. We see in the news that they are giving a lot to charity. I am sure a lot of those folks are giving to charity out of the goodness of their hearts, for good, solid altruistic reasons. I am also confident that a lot of people with wealth give to charity because under current law, it benefits them; those charitable contributions are deductible. They would far rather give to a charity than to Uncle Sam. They would rather give to their children first, but they would rather give to a charity than Uncle Sam. 
   I think you are going to see a huge drop in charitable contributions if this House-passed bill the majority party is pushing is enacted into law. At the very least, we never had hearings on this. We really don't know what effect it will have on charitable contributions. We really don't know what real effect repeal of the stepped-up basis and moving over to the carryover basis can have either. We can surmise. I don't hear the majority talking about those issues much, which leads me to the conclusion that there is probably more of a problem with these issues than they want people to believe. What our best guess of the effect? We could determine it best if we had hearings, but there have been no hearings on Federal estate taxes in this Congress--none in the Senate. 
   I won't belabor the point. I think it is just basic things we should be thinking about before we rush to passage of the House-passed bill. Let's move on to the substance. Remember, under current law, the estate tax applies to estates worth more than $675,000. That is the law. That amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in the year 2006. In addition, we have special rules that increase the exemption for family-held businesses to $1.3 million. That is current law. 
   To put this in perspective, next year it is expected that about 2.5 million Americans will die. Of those 2.5 million, roughly 50,000 will have estates that will pay an estate tax under current law. That is 2 percent. I will repeat that because it is worth remembering. Of the number of people who will die this year, about 2 percent of those people will have estates subject to estate tax. So 98 percent of Americans who die will not have estates that are subject to the estate tax. That is current law. 
   With this basic picture in mind, today's debate presents two separate alternatives, two ways to reform the estate tax. There is the House-passed bill and there is the Democratic alternative. 
   Let's look at the House bill. What does it do? It works in two steps. Over the first 9 years, it gradually reduces estate tax rates down to a top rate of about 40 percent. How does it do it? Really, it doesn't reduce taxes very quickly during that 9 years because the first year the only things that are actually repealed are the top rate, which is 55 percent, and the surtax. During that time other modest cuts are made. Then the next year, the 53 percent rate is repealed, and then on down. Then in the final year, you get total repeal. The bill waits a full 10 years after enactment before it completely repeals the estate tax. That is when the real effect of the House bill is felt. It is not in the first 10 years but after total repeal, after 10 years. 
   At the same time, the House bill imposes a new requirement. When full repeal goes into effect, people who inherit estates worth more than certain amounts must maintain what tax lawyers call the ``carryover basis'' of inherited assets. I discussed that a few minutes ago. That, in a nutshell, is the House bill. 
   The Democratic alternative takes a different approach. It does two things--very simple but effective. First, we dramatically increase the amount that is exempt from estate tax. Currently, as I mentioned, it is $675,000. We increase the per person exemption to $1 million per spouse right away. A few years later, we begin to increase it again, until it reaches $2 million. For a couple, that is a $4 million exemption right across the board. 
   Second, we increase the family-owned business exclusion to $4 million per spouse. For a couple, it is $8 million. 
   Those are the two alternatives. 
   When you compare them, it should be pretty clear the Democratic alternative has two important virtues. First, the Democratic alternative provides dramatic relief, while the Republican bill does not. And it provides dramatic relief where it is needed the most--small businesses, family-held farms and ranches. 
   In the first year, we would exempt over 40 percent of the estates that are currently subject to an estate tax. Not the House bill, the majority proposed bill; it actually would affect very few people in the first year and it wouldn't exempt anyone from the tax. The Democratic alternative would exempt 40 percent. In fact, ours contains much more relief for estates in this range than the House bill would begin to provide. 
   Over the longer term, when the provisions take full effect, the Democratic alternative exempts more than two-thirds of all estates. Remember, of all the people who die in America, only 2 percent are subject to estate tax in the first place. The Democratic alternative exempts two-thirds of all those; that is, two-thirds of the 2 percent. It would also exempt three-quarters of all small businesses that might otherwise be paying tax, and 95 percent of all farms and ranches that would have to pay the estate tax under current law. 
   In contrast, the House-passed bill doesn't go nearly that far. It provides very little relief to these estates for the first 10 years. Granted, eventually it provides total relief, but that is 10 years from now, not in the interim. In 2010 the Republican bill repeals the tax completely, including estates worth not only $2 million or $3 million, or family businesses up to $8 million, but  it also repeals the estate tax for huge estates--$100 million estates, $1 billion estates, $5 billion estates. It totally repeals any tax whatsoever on estates of that size. 
   Yesterday, I spoke in opposition to the House bill, and Senators THOMAS and INHOFE expressed a little surprise. They said when they talk to ordinary folks in their home States, they hear a lot about the estate tax, and people want reform. They wondered whether I was hearing the same in my State of Montana. I sure am, all the time--in coffee shops, in grocery stores, lots of people talk to me. They think it hits too hard on farms, ranches, and small businesses. That is precisely the point. The House bill responds to these with an abstraction--repeal, 10 years from now. 
   The Democratic alternative says, no, we are not going to wait 10 years; we are going to do it now. We respond with honest-to-goodness relief. I am sure there is somebody in Montana with an estate worth more than $8 million who will still have to pay some estate tax under the Democratic alternative. But there sure aren't many of them. 
   Remember, the vast majority of the estates are either not affected by the tax now or, if they are, would be completely exempt under the Democratic alternative. One other virtue of the Democratic alternative is it costs much less than the House bill, $40 billion less over 10 years. After that, the savings are even greater. 
   As a result, the Democratic alternative allows us not only to reform the estate tax in a way that helps where it is needed the most, but it also allows us to address other priorities that, frankly, are more important than total repeal of the estate tax, particularly for huge estates. 
   For example, what about the national debt? The Democratic alternative leaves an additional $40 billion available to pay down the national debt. Or we could use the savings to provide tax cuts to meet other important needs; help average families save for retirement or their kids' college education, or help people meet long-term medical care costs; protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   Believe me, these are good things that we hear about at home all the time. I believe that more people are more concerned about these matters than they are about total repeal of the estate tax, particularly for large estates.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, I heard him speak about the desire to get the appropriations bills passed, which I am in favor of, but did I hear the majority leader say not only is it his intention to bring up appropriations bills this month, but did I hear him include PNTR? 
   I think in the same spirit of compromise which we just passed the Defense authorization bill, as it has been referred to, we can work to get PNTR up this month and passed, along with the appropriations bills--as many as we can. 
   I say to the majority leader, I will do my part in helping with the estate tax reform bill to try to limit the amount of time on that bill and also work on other appropriations bills. I think it is necessary that PNTR also be included in the list of measures that we will bring up and pass this month.

   I wonder if I could ask the majority leader if PNTR is included in the list of ``must-pass'' measures for July? We are all working together, particularly with the good meeting we had last evening in the majority leader's office with Senator THOMPSON and others, working out provisions of the Thompson 
   amendment. There is a good chance we can move things along.

For example, on the estate tax bill, I think there are a couple of amendments on your side that will be accepted by voice vote or agreed to by voice vote to help move this along. In that spirit, I remind the leader it is critical that PNTR come up and be disposed of this month.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a lot has been said about this issue on both sides, the bill offered by the majority and the Democratic alternative, how best to deal with estate taxes. As often is the case, there is a lot of rhetoric flying around here, a lot of claims, a lot of words. It is, I am sure, difficult for the American public who may be listening to this debate to try to ascertain the facts. Most people would like to know which bill does make more sense, after hearing all the debate and all the rhetoric. I would like to do what I can to give some honest facts and let the people decide for themselves. 
   One is the statement made by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, that the Treasury Department, in estimating the cost of their bill, did not look at the capital gains effect. That is just not true. The fact is the Treasury Department did look at the capital gains effect in the second 10 years of the bill. That figure, $750 billion in cost, is an accurate figure. That is a fact. 
   Second, the point was made--and by other Senators--that the small business exemption in the Democratic bill is too complicated; farmers, ranchers, and small businesses just cannot qualify. The fact is, No. 1, there has to be some provision in the code which indicates who does and who does not qualify for 
   an exemption. There has to be some set of guidelines. There are guidelines which were modified in 1997 on a bipartisan basis by both Republicans and Democrats. That is in the law today. 
   I might say, too, we, in our bill, by raising the small business exemption for small businesses and family farms--and also, I might add, unified credit--do give great relief to farmers and ranchers, not only in the first year but the second year and all the years that are contained in this bill; whereas, in the House-passed bill, even though they might complain about the provision of the law which gives exemption, there is nothing advocated by the majority side which deals with anything that would help farmers and ranchers in the family-held exemption. 
   Basically, the fact is, if you are a farmer or rancher or if you are a small business person and you are trying to decide which of these two bills is going to help you the most, it is clear; it is black and white. The Democratic alternative is going to help farmers and ranchers, small business people--family-held businesses--dramatically more in the first year, the second year, the third year, the fourth year, and forever; whereas, in the House-passed bill, there is virtually no help to farmers and ranchers and business people until the 10th year, when it is automatically repealed. 
   I might also add, the cost is a matter of concern. Here we are in Congress, trying to give estimates as to what the budget surplus will be in the next 10 years, the next 20 years. That is a hard thing to do, but we do our best. Ironically, because we did not want the measures to be backloaded too much the second 5 years, we have now asked for 10-year estimates instead of 5-year estimates. The net effect of that is it blows up the surpluses so they look so large. 
   The difficulty is those are only projections. That is all they are; they are just projections. At the same time, we are here today talking about law. We are discussing what a new law should be and how much taxes should be reduced. On the one hand, it is projections; on the other hand, it is the cold reality of law. 
   I do not know if this is going to happen; nobody knows, but it could well be that 5 years from now, 10 years from now, the economy might not be doing so well; the projections might be off. I do not know if it is wise--I am only talking about wisdom here--to pass a tax reduction bill which does not take effect, in a sense, for another 10 years, which is so dramatic in its reduction of taxes at a time when we really do not know what the economic picture of the country will be.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend from Nevada. 
   I will sum up because these are the facts. We have a choice: It is the House-passed bill or the Democratic alternative. The House-passed bill gives no relief, no estate is exempted under the House-passed bill, none, for 10 years--none. On the Democratic alternative, the vast majority of farmers  and ranchers and small business people--family held--are exempt from paying estate taxes. That is a fact. 
   Fact No. 2: The Democratic alternative is less expensive. Why? Because it does not totally repeal the estate tax, the effect being for the very wealthy taxpayers. That is a fact. 
   Do we want to repeal the estate tax for the most wealthy taxpayers? I submit, because we are dealing with budget estimates, we do not know what the outyears are going to be. Because the House bill does not take effect for 10 years anyway, it makes sense to pass measures which do not repeal for the most wealthy, but, rather, save some of that for debt reduction, for education tax credits, or for other matters that, really, more American people really care more about than total tax relief for the most wealthy. That is really the question here. 
   I think most Americans, when they look at the facts of the bill and ask themselves which of those two choices makes the more sense, would think discretion is the better part of valor here. We cannot have everything. There is moderation in everything. The most moderate, balanced way is to say: OK, let's address the problem we are most concerned with--small businesses, farmers, and ranchers--because that is what is most important; but let's not do everything because we live in a society where we have to work things out on a fair, balanced basis and take things a step at a time. 
   Most Americans are very balanced, have common sense and lots of wisdom. That is the way we should go.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very good friend from Utah for offering this amendment. It is high time that we make the R&D tax credit permanent. It is almost impossible to come up with a reason why it is not permanent. It is like a yo-yo--on for a year and off. Then they have to make it retroactive. It is nuts. 
   Business abhors uncertainty. If we can make this permanent, that is one uncertainty that can be dispensed with. 
   Obviously, the United States is going to remain the powerful economic engine in research and development, and the tax credit should be made permanent. It is a key part of that. 
   I thank my good friend. I am proud to be a cosponsor of his amendment. I hope it passes. Unfortunately, it is on a bill that the President says he will veto. I hope some time between now and then we can find a vehicle and some way to pass this measure.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, for all the reasons indicated, I very strongly oppose this amendment. I point out that the opposition to this amendment is very strongly bipartisan. Senator VOINOVICH from Ohio spoke against the amendment and, in a few minutes, Senator WARNER from Virginia, one of the key Senators in writing the TEA-21 program, will strongly oppose this amendment. There is very strong bipartisan opposition. 
   The second point I want to make is that this is really, in some sense, kind of a disingenuous amendment. It would make Tammany Hall blush. This is an amendment that would lower taxes just before an election, to the effect that it would increase taxes right after election. I tell you, is that what the American public likes us to do? Lower taxes before an election and pop up automatically and increase it after election? Merry Christmas, a new tax. This goes back into effect in 150 days. Thank you, but I don't think that is something we want to do. 
   In addition, I have heard it said that there is an ironclad guarantee that nothing comes out of the highway trust fund and the dollars will go for highways. Not true. If Congress meets today, tomorrow, or next week, Congress can always change this provision if it is adopted. There is no guarantee that dollars won't go to the States--none whatsoever, to be clear. 
   Number 3, I find it ironic that here we are on an estate tax bill trying to help farmers and ranchers, and if this 18-cent Federal gasoline tax actually is passed on--I doubt it will be because the oil industry will take advantage--but if it is, what will be the effect? It will hurt farmers and ranchers. Why? It is going to make gasohol comparatively uncompetitive. 
   Corn producers, wheat producers, and those who need current law to give them a competitive break to produce gasohol and ethanol from corn and from wheat will be severely disadvantaged if this amendment were to have the effect it purports to have. I don't think it is going to have that effect anyway. If it does, that means there is no help to our motorists. Rather, it all goes into the pockets of the oil companies or the jobbers and marketers. There are tons of reasons why this is a bad idea. I haven't the time to go into all of them. But I wanted to give a flavor of some of the problems that this causes. I hope Senators realize what the consequences would be.  
   I yield whatever time I have remaining to my good friend from Virginia, Senator WARNER.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the rule of thumb is that for every $10 billion in highway funds 42,000 jobs are created. Those are good paying jobs. These are not service industry jobs. Those are highway jobs. 
   The effect of this amendment would be to cut the funding of the highway trust fund by $13 billion over 150 days--roughly 5 months. That is going to mean upwards of at least 50,000 American jobs cut--not there.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Not only in Montana, but all across the country because this will cost $13 billion. I know the proponents like to claim that the $13 billion would be spent because we take it from other programs. But I point out that $13 billion translates per 150 days into about $30 billion a year. 
   I ask my good friends rhetorically: Where are we going to cut $30 billion for other programs? I don't think that is going to happen. 
   Second, even though, if this amendment were to pass--I pray that it does not, but if it were to pass--Congress would probably go into a big scramble. I know my good friend on the Appropriations Committee, Senator BYRD, and Senator STEVENS would say: Where in the world are we going to find $30 billion in one year? It just isn't there.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, to summarize, obviously motorists do not like paying higher gasoline prices. As has been pointed out, it is a product, essentially, of supply and demand--in this case, short supply. That is what has happened. 
   I must also point out the price of gasoline is starting to come down significantly. According to figures as of July 10, the national average price of gasoline has fallen 3 cents since last week, 8 cents since the recent high on July 12. That is not a lot, but it is better. In the Midwest, prices have fallen by 28 cents since their high on June 19, settling just below the national average, I might add. And for areas in the Midwest using reformulated gasoline, prices have fallen more than 34 cents since their high on June 19, settling just 4 cents above the national average. So prices are already coming down. 
   No. 2, in real terms we are paying less, one-third less than we were in 1981. That is not an unimportant point. That is very important. 
   In addition, this is an off-again, on-again tax. This is a yo-yo tax. On again, off again, that is no way for the Congress to conduct fiscal policy. It just is not. Pretty soon, if we do this, we will have off-again, on-again taxes on everything under the Sun. What in the world is going on here? The American people want stability. They don't like the charades, the sleights of hand. Here is a tax that is going to go off just before an election, go right back on right after the election. Come on, give me a break. Is that what we want to do here? 
   I might add, this is expensive. The Senator says it is not going to come out of the highway trust fund. Let's put it this way: There is going to be at least $13 billion lost to revenue, and the Appropriations Committee has the authority to set the ceilings that are spent under the highway program. So it could lower those ceilings. It could come out of the highway trust fund, in effect. When we are out here trying to balance the budgets and figure out how to keep spending underneath the caps, there is a very good chance these dollars will come out of the highway trust fund and not go to the States. It is going to happen. 
   Finally, this is a program that has the trust of the American people. When they go to the pump and pay that 18.4 cents, they know it goes to the highway trust fund and they know the dollars come back to their States for highway construction, bridges, urban programs, and so forth. 
   Let's keep a little sanity around here and resoundingly reject this amendment.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an amendment to help people who are not now putting aside money for their retirement. It is combined with measures previously addressed by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. KERREY, with respect to KidSave. It is a combined amendment along with the Democratic estate tax alternative. 
   So, like other Democratic amendments, this replaces the estate tax provisions in the House bill with the estate tax relief in the Democratic alternative. 
   As I said before, there are two reasons we have our Democratic alternative. One, it provides more relief more quickly to the folks who really need it; that is, our family businesses, small businesses, ranchers and farmers; and the second part of the basic Democratic alternative amendment is it puts the $40 billion that is saved, compared with the House-passed bill, to better use. Instead of providing further estate tax relief for the few individuals who, by any measure, are very well off--that is, the top portion of the 2 percent--we decided to encourage middle-class families to do more to provide for their own retirement. 
   We give every child a stake in the American dream. Senator KERREY mentioned the phenomenon of compounding interest. The rule of thumb is that, if you earn 7 percent interest, your money will double every 10 years, at 10 percent interest, your money doubles every 7 years. You can imagine the magic of compounding over a child's lifetime. Senator KERREY has eloquently described that portion of the amendment. 
   I will explain the portion that is the incentive for retirement saving. Why do we need an incentive? Let me start by pointing out that Social Security is the primary source of income for two-thirds of elderly Americans. We have to stop and think about that just a second. Social Security is the primary source of income for two-thirds of elderly Americans. That is, they do not have other sources of income that amount to very much. In fact, it is the only source of income for about 16 percent of the elderly. For 16 percent, it is the only source. 
   Those of us who offer this amendment believe, of course, we must protect Social Security. I think everyone in this Chamber agrees with that statement. But I also believe that is not enough. We must complement Social Security by helping people set additional savings aside because Social Security is not enough. Otherwise, there are far too many Americans who will spend their retirement years just one step away from poverty. 
   So our goal is to increase pension savings, retirement savings, in addition to the Social Security program. That is partly because America is not a nation of savers. We have seen all the statistics. Personal savings rates have continually declined in this country. One-half of all Americans have less than $10,000 set aside for retirement. Let me repeat that. One-half of all Americans have less than $10,000 set aside for retirement. Obviously, we need more.  
   Part of the solution is pension and IRA reform. Senator ROTH of Delaware has done wonderful work helping this Nation develop better IRA programs. In fact, we have an IRA program named after him, the ROTH IRA. And I have worked with Senators GRAHAM and GRASSLEY on reform for employer-sponsored pension plans. But pension and IRA reform are not the complete solution. After all, pension reform encourages people who are already saving to save a little more. We also need to give people who are not saving anything now--middle- and lower-income people, an incentive to save as well. That is people who are working hard, playing by the rules, but still struggling to make ends meet--which is most Americans, if truth were known--those folks with less than $10,000 set aside for retirement. 
   That is what our retirement savings amendment would do. It would help in two separate ways: First, it provides a refundable tax credit to match the savings of middle-income workers and spouses. It phases out once the income gets higher, but it is focused on lower and middle income--and I mean middle income, because it phases out with incomes about $75,000. Second, we provide tax incentives to encourage small business owners to start new pension plans for themselves and their employees. 
   My State of Montana is a small business State. About 20 percent of employees have access to pension plans because it is very hard for a small business person to set up a pension plan. If you stop and think about it, when a person sets up his business or her business, that first day that business owner must meet a payroll tax, and it is big. It may take a while before the business starts making money, and even then, there is only so much money to go around. So the business owner has to prioritize. And most lower income workers are much more interested in getting health care coverage or other benefits than they are in a pension plan. Our amendment provides an incentive to help make it a good business decision for that small business person to offer a pension plan to his or her employees. 
   I believe this amendment gets our priorities pretty right. In estate tax reform, it provides dramatic tax relief for 90 percent of the farmers and ranchers who are hit by an estate tax; three-quarters of family-held businesses who are otherwise paying estate tax, and about two-thirds of people overall who now pay tax. At the same time, it sets aside $40 billion to give incentives to small businessmen to start pension plans, and help them and their employees keep their pension plan going. It will help millions of Americans, particularly middle-income Americans, increase their wealth so they can have their stake in the economy and encourage them to save for retirement to supplement Social Security. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Senator KERREY spoke earlier on the KidSave portion of this amendment. 
   I don't see anyone else wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a good amendment which includes the best two-thirds of the estate tax relief in the House bill, which is the bill promoted by the majority side. It combines this estate tax relief with important incentives for middle-income persons to save for their retirement. Retirement security is known as a stool with three legs--Social Security, employer-sponsored pension plans and personal savings. This amendment goes a long way toward strengthening those last two legs for middle and lower-income America. By giving a tax credit to those under $75,000 in income to encourage them to save for retirement, and tax credits to small businesspeople who set up new plans for their workers, we can truly help average Americans save for the future.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I heard the speech of my good friend from Georgia on the House bill. After very thorough consideration of this matter, I reach a different conclusion, I must say to my good friend from Georgia. Frankly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the House bill to repeal the estate tax. I do this for three reasons. 
   First, there is a significant chance that the debate will be conducted under the restrictions of cloture, which denies Senators a fair opportunity to propose amendments. 
   Second, the House bill reforms the estate tax the wrong way. There are all kinds of ways to reform the estate tax. The House bill is the wrong way. 
   Third, the House bill crowds out and pushes aside other more important priorities in which the vast majority of the American people are far more interested. 
   Before getting into those arguments in detail, I will provide some background about the estate tax. Nobody likes paying taxes, whether it is income taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, corporate taxes, or estate taxes. Of course, if one asks in a poll, would you like to have a certain tax repealed, the vast majority of Americans would say, yes, I don't like paying that tax, repeal it. Unfortunately, we all know we do have to pay some tax. After all, in a civilized society, there is some revenue that has to be raised to support society's governmental, organizational purpose and structure. The only question is, obviously, how much and what is the balance. 
   We should aim to have a tax system that raises the minimum amount of revenue that is necessary and does it in a fair and balanced way. For more than 80 years, there has been a consensus that the estate tax is a small but important part of a fair and balanced tax system. It has been a bipartisan consensus. 
   The Federal estate tax was first proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt. It was repeated by his successor, William Howard Taft. In fact, in  his inaugural address in 1909, President Taft said that it may be necessary to raise additional revenue and that if so ``new kinds of taxation must be adopted, and among these I recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection.'' That was President William Howard Taft. 
   A few years later, in 1916, Congress needed to raise additional revenue primarily to prepare for possible involvement in World War I. Congress had to make hard choices. Congress could either raise tariff rates or it could come up with an alternative. This is what the House Committee on Ways and Means said:  
   It is probable that no country in the world derives as much revenue per capita from its people through the consumption tax as does the United States. It is therefore deemed proper that, in meeting the extraordinary expenditures for the Army and the Navy our revenue system should be more evenly and equitably balanced and a larger portion of our necessary revenues collected from the incomes and inheritances of those deriving the most benefit and protection from the government.  
   Congress enacted the estate tax in 1916. It has been amended several times. For example, in 1932, in response to revenue needs generated by the Great Depression, the rates were increased significantly. In 1981, under President Reagan, the rates were cut significantly, with the top rate falling from 70 percent to 55 percent. Today the Federal estate tax applies to estates with a value of more than $675,000. That threshold amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million by the year 2006. There are special rules for farms and for family businesses. 
   All told, the tax applies to the estates of about 2 out of every 100 people who die each year. That is about 2 percent. It raises $28 billion a year. To put that in perspective, it is 3 percent of the amount that is raised by the Federal income tax. under the estate tax. 
   That brings me to the House bill we have before us today. The House bill works in two steps. First, over the first 9 years, the House bill gradually reduces estate taxes down to a top rate of about 40 percent. Then in the year 2010, a full 10 years after enactment, it completely repeals the estate tax. At the same time the House bill imposes a new requirement, something of which not many Senators are aware. People who inherit estates worth more than certain amounts must maintain what tax lawyers call the ``carryover basis'' of inherited assets. That is in the House bill. 
   All told, the 10-year cost of the House bill is $105 billion. But it is important to note that the House bill is constructed to 
   disguise the real long-term costs. In the 10th year, when the estate tax is completely repealed, the cost is almost $50 billion a year, and the cost will rise each year after that. I have seen estimates up to $750 billion over the second 10 years. 
   That, in a nutshell, is the House bill. 
   As I said at the outset, I oppose the bill. I do so for several reasons. My first concern is with the process. Once again, the majority may invoke cloture as a first resort. This limits debate. It limits the ability for Senators to offer amendments. Most important of all, it denies the American people an opportunity to have their elected representatives conduct a full, unfettered public debate about a very important issue. I hope that we can avoid cloture and have an open debate. 
   I have another concern about the process. This is a serious issue, whether we repeal a Federal estate tax. We are considering a proposal that can be fairly described as radical--total repeal. That is pretty radical. The House bill would completely repeal a tax that has been an integral part of the Federal tax system since 1916; repeal it, lock, stock, and barrel, get rid of it totally, with no amendments and no hearing. That raises many serious questions. 
   One is the impact across income levels. I am not talking about class warfare. Believe me, that is one thing I don't like to get into; I don't believe in it. That is bashing the rich. Rather, I am talking about fully understanding the impact of this proposal on the overall fairness and balance of our tax system, a subject we have not addressed. It hasn't even been raised; we haven't had the opportunity. 
   Another question is about the new rules to maintain the carryover basis of certain inherited assets--very complicated, totally new, not debated, not even known by a majority of Senators. In some cases, this would require recordkeeping across several generations. Just think of that, requiring new recordkeeping across several generations. I remember back when Congress tried to do something similar in 1978. The new law was extraordinarily complex. It created a fierce public backlash, and we quickly repealed it. 
   We would do the same if this were ever enacted into law; I guarantee it. Do we want people to have to keep track of the price that their great-great-grandparents paid for property and investments? Under the House bill they will have to. 
   Another question is the impact on charitable giving. A great deal of charitable giving comes from bequests. People make these bequests primarily because they want to help communities. That is a good cause. But we all know in some cases there is a tax planning element because charitable contributions are deducted from the value of an estate. Do we know how repeal of the estate tax will affect charitable giving? Has that been discussed, debated? Many estate tax lawyers I talk to tell me: Max, if you repeal the Federal estate tax, it is going to have a substantial effect on charitable giving. There will be a substantial reduction in charitable giving, major, big time, if you repeal the Federal estate tax. 
   Another question is the impact on States. Currently--this is not well known; how could it be, there hasn't been a hearing; we had no opportunity for amendments--currently an estate receives a credit for inheritance and estate taxes that the estate pays to a State government. As a result, these State taxes generally don't increase the overall burden on an estate. Instead, they shift revenues from the Federal Government to the States. It is about a third. 
   The long and short of it is, about a third of all the Federal estate taxes that are collected go to States. We, therefore, collect the revenue that goes to the States. Under a total repeal, that is the end of that. Does anybody know that? Do the States know that? Do the Governors know that? I don't think they have focused on this because they don't know about it. How could they? There have been no hearings. 
   If the Federal estate tax umbrella is repealed, many States may face strong pressure to reduce or eliminate their own inheritance taxes and estate taxes--resulting in unintended consequences, unthought-out consequences, unknown consequences. 
   Still another question is how repeal of the estate tax will affect the concentration of wealth. As we all know, one reason the estate tax was enacted and later strengthened was to limit the accumulation of huge fortunes that can be passed on to create economic dynasties. Are we prepared to say that today this is no longer an issue? 
   Now I am not trying to be judgmental, Mr. President, believe me. I am just raising very important questions that have to be discussed, debated, and thought out. I am not suggesting I have all the answers. I am simply saying these are very serious questions that deserve more time and attention than we are giving them. After all, we are not referring the House bill to the Finance Committee for a hearing where the questions can be addressed. In fact, the Finance Committee hasn't held a hearing on estate taxes in this Congress. I will repeat that. The Finance Committee has not held a hearing on estate taxes in this Congress. Instead, we are rushing the House bill to the floor under cloture. 
   Why are we doing this? Why not hold hearings so that we can more fully understand the implications of the House bill? That is just my first concern in the process. 
   Now my second concern. While the House bill reforms the estate tax, it reforms it in the wrong way. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. The House bill reforms the wrong way. 
   For a long time, I have supported reform of the estate tax. Most of us here do. I have worked on special rules for farms and ranches. A few years ago, I worked closely with Senator Dole on reforms for family-owned small businesses. 
   Despite these and some other improvements, the estate tax still hits  some people too hard, especially those who own farms, ranches, and small businesses. We should fix that. We should fix it now. We need to help our farmers and our small businesses. The amendment that I and the majority of my side support will do that. 
   The House bill that we may adopt, would do very little for those estates, very little for those farmers, ranchers, and small business people--until 10 years later when, under their bill, it is fully repealed. 
   On the other hand, the alternative that Senators MOYNIHAN, CONRAD, and I propose would reform the estate tax in the right way. It would do two things that are simple but effective. 
   First, we dramatically increase the amount that is exempt from the estate tax. Currently, it is $675,000. We increase it to $1 million per spouse right away. And a few years later, we begin to increase it again until it reaches $2 million. For a couple, that would be $4 million. 
   Second, we increase the family-owned business exclusion to $4 million per spouse. For a couple, that is $8 million. 
   These simple changes have a huge effect. The first year, we would exempt over 40 percent of the estates that currently are subject to an estate tax. The fact is, it is much more relief for estates in this range than the House bill would provide. 
   As this chart shows, the Democratic alternative is on the left. This chart shows who is left paying taxes after the first year. On the left side, you can see the bar there, which represents the Republican bill, 50,000 Americans would continue to pay estate taxes in the first year, just like they would under current law. In the first year, as it shows on the right side, under the Democratic alternative, only 30,000 Americans would pay estate taxes. Guess what. That basically continues for 9 years--not totally, but basically. 
   So the Democratic alternative provides relief--significant relief--in the first 10 years. The Republicans' doesn't. There is some near the end. But there is a cliff effect after 10 years, with all of the consequences we have not even talked about. 
   These simple changes have a huge effect. The first year, we would exempt over 40 percent of the estates that are currently subject to an estate tax. Under the Republican alternative, none would be exempt over the first 10 years. Over the longer term, when the provisions take full effect, the Democratic proposal would exempt two-thirds of all estates, three-quarters of all small businesses, and 90 percent of all farms and ranches that would 
   otherwise have to pay estate tax. 
   Remember, only 2 percent of the estates pay an estate tax. But we are saying in the Democratic alternative that three-quarters of those who currently pay--three-quarters of the small businesses, two-thirds of all estates, and 90 percent of all farmers and ranchers would be exempt. 
   This chart shows that, under current law, the Democratic alternative exempts three-quarters of all family-owned businesses. The Democratic alternative exempts 95 percent of farms. On the left, under current law--this is a huge bar. That means those folks are still paying. Under the Democratic alternative, very few pay. You can see that. 
   This other chart is showing the same thing with respect to all estate taxes. That is, over the first 10 years, fewer Americans will be paying estate taxes than under the House bill. 
   Next year, it is expected that about 2.5 million Americans will die. Roughly 50,000 will have estates that would pay an estate tax under current law. Under the House bill, every one of these estates will still pay an estate tax, but at slightly lower rates, with the greatest rate reductions going to the larger estates. 
   Again, the greatest rate reductions will go to the larger estates; whereas, under the Democratic alternative, the bulk--almost all of the relief--is immediate, and it goes to farms, ranches, and small businesses. The small business exclusion is raised to $8 million per couple eventually, and the unified credit is raised to $4 million eventually. 
   So under our substitute, fully 20,000 of those 50,000 estates won't pay an estate tax at all in the very first year. They will be exempt, period. The exemptions will be concentrated on the farms, ranches, and the small businesses that need relief. That is the right kind of reform, not the wrong kind, which I mentioned earlier. 
   My third concern is about priorities. At the end of the day, that is what this debate is really about. We provide complete relief to estates worth up to $4 million, and farms, ranches, and small businesses worth up to $8 million--complete relief. 
   The proponents of the House bill insist that we go much further, at an additional cost of about $40 billion over 10 years. In later years, the cost will be much higher, about $50 billion a year. They argue, in support of the House bill, that whatever the size of an estate, we should not impose a tax at the event of death rather than when an asset is sold, and we should not impose rates as high as 55 percent. 
   These are serious arguments. I don't dismiss them out of hand. Senator KYL, in particular, has presented an articulate case. But reasonable people can differ. When we get the facts out and determine what is really going out, different people can reach different conclusions. I think it comes down to priorities. 
   It seems to me that we in this Chamber could agree in an instant to provide relief to the vast majority of farms, ranches, and small businesses and, indeed, for the vast majority of estates that are now subject to the tax. We can do it for a cost of $60 billion over 10 years--less than in the House bill. 
   So the real question, then, is whether it makes sense for us to spend another $40 billion to provide relief for people who are, by any measure, very well off and can take care of themselves. 
   Again, it is a question of priorities. Despite the euphoria the new estimated budget surpluses seem to induce, we all know that, in truth, there is no free lunch. If we reduce tax revenue by another $40 million, we will have much less for other priorities, such as health care and prescription drugs, which are much more important to most Americans. 
   Providing middle-class working families relief from payroll taxes is one example; providing incentives for education and savings, and providing incentives for research and development, which will keep our economy on the cutting technological edge, those are other alternatives and higher priorities of the American people which will help make our economy stronger, and providing prescription drug coverage so that seniors don't have to choose between food and medicine. Many, as we well know, have to make that choice. 
   Oh, yes. Let's not forget that we are paying down the national debt. That is pretty important. 
   I hope cloture is not sought. I hope that at some point soon we have a real opportunity to discuss and resolve our differences. 
   After all, there are some positive signs. The President has signaled that he has an interest in compromise. 
   Enlightened business leaders are now suggesting there can be a compromise. In other words, if we want to write a law rather than create a political issue, we can achieve a compromise that makes meaningful reforms in estate tax and also address other pressing national needs. That would be good news. I hope it happens. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I hope the majority side will not object. PNTR transcends all other issues that are before the Senate. It is an international issue. It is a public policy, a foreign policy issue, one which clearly falls in the category of politics stopping at the water's edge. 
   This measure is monumental in its implications. It must pass. The sooner it passes, the better. Delay is danger. We all know that our relations with China are extremely important but also tenuous. The more this issue is delayed, the more likely it is that some untoward, unanticipated, unexpected event might occur which would deteriorate relations between our two countries and make it more difficult to pass a very needed piece of legislation. 
   I understand the majority's concern about scheduling, about appropriations bills, about other matters. But I strongly urge the majority party and the leader of the majority party, who correctly sets the schedule, to put politics beyond this, to put policy, public interest, and national security above all the other concerns that are legitimate here in the Senate because once PNTR is set for a vote this month, I predict that the logjam will break. It will be easier then to take up other measures. 
   I very strongly urge the Senator from New Hampshire to pass the word on to the majority leader, and others, of the importance of bringing this bill up in July--this month, a date certain--so we can begin to establish a relatively comprehensive and solid relationship with the country that is going to be probably one of the most important countries that this country is going to be dealing with in this next century. It is absolutely critical.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last week, I was successful in achieving the inclusion of a bipartisan amendment in the Manager's Amendment on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriation bill, on one of the most important issues we will deal with in this Congress--the poor condition of our Nation's school buildings. 
   Let me briefly describe this amendment before I talk about the larger problem this amendment is seeking to address. 
   This amendment is co-sponsored by Senator BINGAMAN, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator HUTCHISON from Texas--this bipartisan group should send a very strong signal that this amendment is worthy of support. 
   This is a very simple amendment. Both the House and Senate versions of the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill set aside $25 million for Impact Aid school construction. This amendment increases that amount to $10 million. 
   It offsets the increase by reducing the administrative and related expenses of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education on a pro rata basis by $10 million. 
   Allow me to explain why this amendment is so important to me and to the bi-partisan group of Senators that support this amendment. 
   As you know, there are a number of pending bills that address our nation's school construction needs. And in the past days, we have voted on a number of amendments addressing school construction issues generally. 
   These funds assist local school districts who are then able to raise the remainder of their construction funds through bond issues. Like other school costs, the bonds are paid for by taxes on local property. 
   Issuing bonds is a time-honored approach to school construction. But in the heated national debate, one group of children is continually left out in the cold--students who live on federally owned land, usually an Indian reservation or a military installation. 
   In Montana, some 12,000 children fall into this category. 
   These schools are located in areas where much of the local property can't be taxed because of Federal activities. This tax-exempt property may be a military base or an Indian reservation. 
   In many cases, the local public schools have to educate the children of families that live on the property. These so-called ``Federal Students'' could come from military families. They could come from civilian families. They could come from Native American families. 
   The Congress has recognized its responsibility for these schools through payments authorized by Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   The House and Senate bills allocate $25 million for school construction to be distributed under Section 8007 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   This is simply insufficient to meet the needs of these federally impacted schools. 
   In fiscal year 2000, Montana had 28 school districts that were 50 percent or more impacted with either Indian land children or military students. Nationwide, there were 249 such districts. 
   In FY2000, the average allocation per school district in Montana of Impact Aid funds is just below $18,000. The average dollar received per student is $57. 
   Think about that for a moment. $57 for construction is not going to do a heck of a lot of good for schools that are literally falling down. 
   Now, under the FY2001 appropriations bill, funding would increase to approximately $90 per student. And while that's better than $57, it still falls way short of meeting the needs of our students. 
   Let me tell you a couple of stories to illustrate this point. 
   I remember talking last year with the Superintendent for the Harlem School District Don Bidwell. His district is so crowded, he has students  using a closet, where they used to keep the snow blower, for a classroom. Now the snow blower is in the hall and the students are in the closet. 
   And let me tell you about a recent visit with Steve Smyth, the Superintendent of the Browning school district in Montana. 
   Browning is situated in one of the windiest areas of Montana. Mr. Smyth informed me that a year ago, the students, teachers, administrators and community watched the roof on the high school building literally curl up like the lid on a sardine can because of the harsh winds. 
   Just to replace that roof, the district spent $115,881. And yet, they only received $27,000 for school construction and repairs in FY 2000. How can we justify giving them only enough money to pay for one-fourth of their roof? That is a disgrace. 
   Let me give you another example. In 1998, the Box Elder school received $13,000 in Impact Aid construction funding. In FY 2000, they received $19,500. That might be enough to give half the building a paint job, but not for much more. 
   It's like trying to put out a fire with squirt gun. What this school really needs is a new building or a major renovation. 
   The condition of these schools is not a Montana problem. Nor a Nebraska problem. Nor a partisan problem. 
   Instead, it's a national problem. 
   As a nation, we can no longer pretend that this is a problem in a few schools in a few states that can be solved with a few scraps from our federal education appropriation. 
   Every child in the United States deserves a healthy learning environment. An important and vital part of that environment is the physical structure the learning takes place in. Our children should be confident their school will still be standing by the end of the day. Our children shouldn't fear that their school is going to burn down because of faulty wiring. 
   Mothers and fathers should know that when they drop their children off at school or send them off to the school bus, that they are sending them to a safe place. 
   I am pleased the managers of this bill saw this amendment fit to be included in their amendment. I thank Senators BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, and HUTCHISON from Texas for their support. I hope that the conferees will maintain this increased level of funding.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address recent developments in the effort to reform our sanctions policy towards food and medicine. 
   Let me recall a bit of recent history. Late last year, the Senate passed legislation to end the use of food and medicine as a weapon of foreign policy. We passed it by a substantial margin--70 to 28--as an amendment to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill. 
   We have both moral and commercial concerns. It is just wrong to inflict suffering on innocent people by withholding food and medicine because we oppose the policies of their government. This goes against the core values of our nation. 
   Commercially, the reform legislation would open markets to American producers, especially American farmers. They have been struggling through a long and terrible crisis brought on by low prices and bad weather. Opening new foreign markets would especially help our family farms. 
   The sanctions reform amendment ran into stiff opposition from House members in conference. Their main objection was that the bill would allow food and medicine sales to Cuba. Unfortunately, they prevailed, and the amendment was struck from the conference report. 
   That was last year. What about this year? We've had two important developments. 
   On the Senate side, the Agriculture Committee included sanctions reform in the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which was reported out in May. It is the section of the bill entitled the ``Food and Medicine for the World Act.'' I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleagues on this important legislation, especially Senators DODD, DORGAN, ROBERTS, ASHCROFT and HAGEL. 
   It is very similar to the amendment the Senate passed last year. I would note that it contains a new provision which weakens the sanctions reform effort. This provision requires one-year licenses for sales of food or medicine to governments on the State Department's terrorism list. Currently this list covers seven countries, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. I believe that this provision is an unnecessary restriction on our agricultural exporters. 
   But I am much more concerned about recent developments on the House side. 
   In late June, House members struck a deal to accommodate the same small group which fights against sanctions reform every year. Those members now have one main target: Cuba. 
   This recent House deal is billed as a move to lift unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. In fact, it does just the opposite. Let me explain. 
   First, it would outlaw all finance and insurance of food sales to Cuba, even sales to private groups. This would essentially prohibit all U.S. exports. In today's world, nobody trades without some sort of finance. It takes at least a letter of credit. What is the alternative? Only to ride along on the cargo ship to exchange your wheat for cash in Havana harbor. Everybody requires some sort of commercial insurance. In fact, the House agreement is so broadly written that it might even make third-country finance illegal. This is very bad legislation. 
   Second, the House agreement would impose even stricter licensing requirements than are in effect today on sales of food and medicine. These new restrictions would apply not just to Cuba, but also to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria and North Korea. 
   Third, it would make it harder for U.S. exporters to travel to Cuba to explore the market. 
   Fourth, it would prohibit any food assistance, such as Food for Peace, to Cuba, as well as to Iran. 
   Accepting these provisions would be a major setback for the Senate. 
   The House agreement goes beyond sanctions for food and medicine. It includes provisions on travel to Cuba, an entirely unrelated issue. It would remove all flexibility from the current travel regulations in two ways. First, it would make them statutory. They could only be changed in the future by new legislation. Second, it would deny the Treasury Department any discretion in issuing travel licenses. 
   I understand that the current House plan is to strip this bad legislation from their version of the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill, and then bring it up in conference. We must not let a small group of House members prevail again this year. I firmly oppose the House agreement, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. We should work to ensure passage of the Food and Medicine for the World Act. 
   Last year, the Senate took action that was correct and sound. We should continue to press forward.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my concern is that we are setting the July schedule, albeit part of the July schedule, but without inclusion of a date or time for PNTR. I am very concerned that as we start taking up matters in July--even though it is the THOMPSON amendment--who knows what might intervene. You have reconciliation; you have appropriations bills, and whatnot. Because we do not have a date certain on the request for PNTR, it could very easily slip into September or even a later date. 
   I know it is very much the intention of the majority leader to bring up the PNTR in July. He has said that many times. And I very much appreciate that. But as I have said personally to the majority leader, I am not so certain that, despite his best 
   intentions, he can totally control whether or not PNTR actually does come up in July. 
   In addition, the merits of the bill that would otherwise be scheduled to come up after the July recess is very dangerous. I do not think Senators have really had the time to look at the  provisions of that bill, to think through the implications of that bill. It has unilateral sanctions, mandatory--not discretionary--sanctions against China. It is very overdrawn. American companies doing business in China could be sanctioned. It has extraterritorial provisions which are way beyond the ordinary rules of international law. I think it would cause a tremendous strain in the context of PNTR. 
   My concern is that we are setting the schedule for July, albeit just a part of July, that does not include probably the most important vote that this Senate is going to take up this Congress; that is, passage of PNTR. And until there is a date set for PNTR, I must respectfully object.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to a provision, which has been included in the military construction conference report, that prevents EPA from using any funds to implement a new rule to clean up our nation's streams, rivers, and lakes. 
   Let me explain why this rule is important. 
   Since 1972, when the Clean Water Act became law, we've made a lot of progress in cleaning up our water, especially with respect to so-called ``point sources'' like sewage treatment plants and industrial plants; the pipe that come out of plants and go into lakes and streams. 
   But we still are far from reaching our goal of fishable, swimmable waters. That is the standard in the act. 
   That's where the new rule comes in. It relates to something called ``total maximum daily loads,'' or TMDLS. It is a long, technical-sounding label. But it's a pretty simple concept. A TMDL is really a pollution budget for a watershed. It's like the Clean Water Act version of a State implementation plan under the Clean Air Act. 
   The TMDL program was actually enacted as part of the original Clean Water Act, way back in 1972. For a long time, it was dormant. But, in recent years, environmental groups have lawsuits requiring EPA and states to implement the program. In virtually every single case, they have won. 
   In light of this, EPA decided to revise its rules for the TMDL program, to bring them up to date. To begin with, it convened a group of stakeholders, who worked for two years to make recommendations. Then, last August, EPA proposed new rules. 
   Make no mistake about it. These rules have been controversial. 
   Like many others, I have been particularly concerned about the proposal to require many forestry operations to get Clean Water Act permits. I thought EPA was taking a long, winding road that didn't end up in the right place. 
   But EPA has been listening. In response to Congressional hearings and public comments, it has made changes. For example, it dropped the forestry proposal and made other parts of the rule more workable. 
   As I understand it, the rule has gone to OMB for review, and should be published, in final form, soon. 
   But then we get this conference report. Out of the blue, it provides that none of the funds appropriated to EPA for 2000 and 2001 can be used to implement the new rule. 
   I have two major problems with this provision. The first problem is the process by which the provision has been included in the conference report. The process is, in a word, outrageous. Clearly, there are differences of opinion about the TMDL rule. But there are several opportunities for those differences to be debated. 
   The Environment and Public Works Committee is considering a bill, introduced by Subcommittee Chairman CRAPO and Committee Chairman SMITH, that would, among other things, delay the final rule. The House HUD/VA/Independent Agencies Appropriations bill contains a provision that also would delay the rule. 
   Of course, there is the regulatory review process we enacted in 1996, that allows Congress to disapprove a final rule. 
   In each case, we would have a debate. The merits would be discussed. Senators could explain why they believe that the rule should be delayed; others could respond. Then we would have a vote, and the public could judge our actions. 
   That's not what's going on here. Instead, opponents of the rule have slipped the provision into an unrelated conference report that cannot be amended--no debate, no sunshine, no public knowledge of what is going on. And they have done it on a bill that provides emergency funding for many urgent national needs, so that the President is under strong pressure to sign the bill. 
   Frankly, I wonder why they have taken this approach. Why not debate, in clear public view? What are they afraid of? 
   Another thing, by using conference reports this way, we further weaken the bonds that bind this institution together, and reduce public confidence in our deliberative process. This is no way to run a railroad. 
   The second problem with the provision is substantive. Despite significant progress since 1972, too many of our rivers, streams, and lakes do not meet water quality standards. 
   EPA's proposed rule makes some important improvements. At the heart of it, the rule clarifies the operation of the TMDL program and requires implementation plans, so that the program becomes more than a paperwork exercise. At the same time, the rule gives States more time to complete their lists, allocations, and plans--a lot more time. 
   That is a pretty good tradeoff. 
   By blocking the rule, we will simply delay the tough decisions about how to  make the program work. We will perpetuate the current outdated, fragmented, litigious system. 
   Most important of all, we will delay, once again, the day when our nation finally has clean streams, rivers, and lakes, from sea to shining sea. 
   I regret that this provision has been included in the conference report and I will work to reverse the decision at the earliest opportunity. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I share the concerns that have been raised about the potential scope of authority of the electric reliability organizations and would also seek clarification on this point. It is my understanding that in addition to not diminishing or affecting any environmental obligations, this legislation does not authorize the electric reliability organizations to direct or authorize any covered facility to violate or disregard the requirements of any Federal or State environmental law or regulation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the majority leader very much. I assure him, as a member of the Finance Committee, we definitely plan to take up some form of estate tax reform. I don't know what version it would be, but clearly that has to pass this year. 
   In addition, however, I do believe there is one other matter that is even more important than estate tax reform, and that is PNTR for China. It far transcends appropriations bills, marriage penalty relief, bankruptcy reform. Getting PNTR passed in July, I think, is of such urgency and is so important that I am constrained to object to any unanimous consent request that sets the schedule for July unless it also includes a time when we are going to take up PNTR. I know the leader knows that is my view. I just hope that in working with the leader, we can work out some accommodation to reach that objective.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments talking about the issue of PNTR, Permanent Normal Trade Relations, with China. Last month, the House passed H.R. 4444. That bill authorizes PNTR for China once the multilateral protocol negotiations are completed and the WTO General Council approves China's accession. The bill includes a solid package of provisions that establishes a framework for monitoring progress and developments in China in the human rights area. It also provides for enhanced monitoring of China's compliance with its trade commitments. 
   Now, it is our turn in the Senate to act. We have two challenges. First, we need to debate the bill now, not later. And, second, we need to pass the bill without amendment. I call on the Majority Leader to set a date certain in July to start this process. 
   Extending permanent normal trade relations status to China. Regularizing our economic and trade relationship with China. Bringing China into the global trade community. Helping the development of a middle class in China. Developing an environment between our two countries where we can productively engage China in significant security, regional, and global discussions. These are not Democratic issues. These are not Republican issues. These are national issues. Passage of PNTR is a first step, and it is critical to America's national economic and security interests. 
   Support in the Senate is strong. I believe there will be an overwhelming vote in favor of final passage. Republicans and Democrats. Small states and large. East and West. North and South. Conservative and liberal. Most of us recognize how important this is to our country, to the region, and to the world. 
   That is why I will continue to urge the Majority Leader to set a firm date to bring the PNTR bill to the floor so we can move this legislation. I ask my colleagues, Republican, as well as Democrat, to join me in delivering that message to the Majority Leader. 
   Once it comes to the floor, there will likely be a plethora of amendments, some germane and others non-germane. The Senate has its own rights and prerogatives. I will always defend the right of Senators to offer amendments to a bill. But, I am concerned that amendments in the Senate, which would force the bill into a conference with the House, would lead to delaying, and perhaps jeopardizing, final passage of this landmark legislation. We cannot afford such a development. 
   H.R. 4444 is a very balanced bill. It deals with the major concerns relative to China's entry into the global trading system. Therefore, along with many of my colleagues, I have made a commitment to oppose any amendment to H.R. 4444, no matter how meritorious the amendment might be on its own terms. Prompt passage and enactment of this bill should be a top bipartisan priority. I urge all my colleagues to join me in making the commitment to oppose any attempt to amend this legislation. 
   H.R. 4444 ensures that future U.S. administrations will closely monitor China's compliance with its WTO obligations and with other trade agreements made with the United States. It will make the administration in the future act promptly in the case of damaging import surges. It provides for a vigorous monitoring of human rights, worker rights, and the import of goods produced by forced or prison labor. H.R. 4444 also provides for technical assistance to help develop the rule of law in China. It enhances the ability of U.S. government radios to broadcast into China. And it states the sense of Congress regarding Taiwan's prompt admission to the WTO. 
   To repeat, extending PNTR to China is vitally important to America's economic and strategic interests. Our top priority should be a bill approved by the Senate identical to H.R. 4444 so that it can immediately be sent to the President for signature. I hope we complete action rapidly in July.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I could consult with the good Senator from Iowa on a matter which I raised earlier, that is, the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, asked unanimous consent for the Senate to take up a list of amendments on both sides and to have printed that list of amendments with respect to the pending bill.  
   I asked the majority leader if it might not be a good idea for the leader to set a date certain in July to bring up PNTR. I am not asking the Senator for his view on the bill, but I ask the Senator if he thinks it is a good idea to bring the bill up and at least have a vote on it, particularly in July. Wouldn't it be better to have a bill brought up in July than, say, in September, given the fact that it has passed the House, given the fact that we will bring it up sometime this session of Congress, and given the fact that delay is dangerous? 
   Does the Senator agree it would be a good idea to bring it up and have a date certain, at least for insurance that we are going to vote on it this year? The month of July would be the preferable month to vote on it rather than a subsequent month; does the Senator agree?

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President. I regret that I was unable to vote on Amendment 3625 to the Labor-Health Human Services appropriations bill. It was important for me to be in Montana for a conference I had organized on the future of our state's economic development. 
   I would like to explain how I would have voted on this amendment, had I been present. 
   In our current era of staggering scientific achievement--as demonstrated by yesterday's announcement of the mapping of the human genome--it is easy to become complacent with medical technology. 
   However, we cannot afford the price of complacency. One of the greatest health threats our nation currently faces is antibiotic resistant infections. These infections are the result of abuse and misuse of antibiotics--the drugs which form the keystone of modern medicine. These drug resistant infections know no barriers and are a threat  to us all. The World Health Organization reports that antibiotic-resistant infections acquired in hospitals kill over 14,000 people in the United States every year. Unless steps are taken to monitor and prevent antibiotic misuse, this number can only increase. 
   Protecting our nation and our children from antibiotic resistant infections is vital. That is why I am pleased to support this amendment. This legislation increases the ability of public health agencies to monitor and fight antibiotic resistant infections. It also seeks to reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistance by educating doctors and patients about the proper use of antibiotics. 
   This legislation will help protect the health of all Americans and I applaud my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Baucus-Roberts amendment to include China in the environmental and humanitarian U.S.-Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP). This program provides an invaluable service to the rapidly developing countries of Asia. Through sharing knowledge and technologies developed to resolve problems with the water, land and sky, the USAEP improves the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
   Unfortunately, China has yet to take part in this important program. Our amendment seeks to undo this outdated sanction on Asia's largest and most environmentally sensitive nation.
   Let me share a few highlights about the program. First, the USAEP provides trained environmental and commercial specialists that provide business counseling to Asians and Americans. They help to link prospective business partners and identify innovative, cost-effective solutions to sensitive environmental problems.
   Making USAEP funds available for U.S.-China Partnerships would benefit both our countries. For example, access to funding for partnerships with China would have a tremendous positive effect on many states such as Montana. These funds would open large markets for environmental services that, for all practical purposes, have been closed to business from the United States.
   The Chinese need for environmental services is extreme. China requires more than $10 billion in annual investment to combat water pollution, air pollution, municipal and industrial waste, agricultural runoff and protection of natural environments. Much of the expertise required to address these problems will have to come from outside of China.
   Montana possesses an outstanding environmental industry with the skills and experience to help China address these problems. Despite the fact that Montana companies have exactly the expertise that China needs to address its environmental problems, Montana companies have been unable to enter the Chinese market. The State government and the companies themselves lack the funding required to develop long-term relationships with appropriate Chinese companies or government officials.
   China already has extensive environmental cooperation with Canada, Europe and Japan. Environmental Minister Xie Zhenhua has attributed the relative lack of cooperation between U.S. businesses and China to the low level of U.S. government funding for business development and technology transfer.
   This lack of funding for has not only limited U.S. access to Chinese markets for environmental services but it has increased the income disparity between large exporting states and rural states like Montana. California and Washington, states that can afford to promote business development, have seen exports to China grow significantly over the past 5 years. Meanwhile, the incomes of Montanans have experienced a steady decline relative to these richer states.
   USAEP funding to support development of U.S.-Chinese business relationships is vital to the growth of Montana's environmental industry. Even modest funding for business development could lead to millions of dollars to the Montana economy. Without a  doubt, similar opportunities would be available nationwide.
   It's time to do the right thing. The time is ripe for such action, particularly as China prepares to enter the rules-based trading system we know as the World Trade Organizations.
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator ROBERTS and me in this important endeavor. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am a very strong supporter of the amendment offered by my colleague from Connecticut. Very simply, it is a no-brainer. It is a bipartisan commission to look at our policy, which is supported by good Republicans--Howard Baker and Jack Danforth, former Senators of this body. It is not directed at agriculture, it is not directed at other points raised on this floor; it is just a bipartisan commission to reassess our policy with Cuba. Nothing could be more simple, direct, and appropriate than that. 
   I also want to speak about Cuba with respect to trade. We have targeted Fidel Castro for four decades. For the last 40 years, believe it or not, we have maintained a special category in our  trade and foreign policy with Cuba--a one-country category: Cuba. We have special legislation for trade with Cuba. We have special rules for travel to Cuba. We have a special system for claims on Cuba. 
   Why does Cuba get so much of our attention? When the United States began targeting Fidel Castro, we had very serious national security concerns. Castro was openly hostile to us. He was a Soviet client and just 90 miles away from us. Thanks to Soviet aid, he had military and economic muscle to make him someone to take seriously. Castro worked against the United States throughout the sixties, seventies, and eighties. Bankrolled by the Soviet Union, he exported revolution throughout the Western Hemisphere. He sent troops to support revolutionaries as far away as Africa. Castro backed international terrorists who targeted Americans. He was a clear adversary. 
   What is the situation today? Does Castro still favor revolution? I am sure he does. Does he still oppose American interests? Absolutely. But does he still have military and economic muscle to threaten our national security? The answer, obviously, is no. 
   The Soviet Union is now in the dustbin of history. Their demise cut off Castro's lifeline. Today, his economy is in shambles. With 11 million educated, dynamic people, Cuba produces only $22 billion a year. It only exports about $1.4 billion worth of goods. The Cuban economy remains stuck in the 1960s in terms of trade and technology. 
   Sugar is still the country's top export earner. Cuban farmers are forced to sell over half the country's agriculture output to the Government at below-market prices. Since Castro can no longer trade sugar for Soviet oil, his people suffer tremendously, for example, from rolling power blackouts. Since he defaulted on foreign debt payments in the 1980s, Cuba pays double-digit interest rates on short-term loans to finance sugar trade. 
   With this country in desperate financial shape, Castro is in no position to export revolution--none whatsoever. According to the Pentagon, Castro presents no real threat to our national security. 
   Times have changed. Forty years ago, Castro was a clear danger. Today, he is not a present danger. Has our policy toward Cuba changed? Not really. Cuba still occupies a unique position in American policy. 
   I believe it is time for the United States to have a normal relationship with Cuba, especially a normal trade relationship. I have cosponsored legislation which we passed here by an overwhelming margin last year to lift unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. 
   I believe we should go beyond this. We should repeal the laws that make Cuba a specific target. That includes the anti-Cuba laws we passed in 1992 and 1996, as well as other laws developed over the past 40 years. We should end our embargo of Cuba and eliminate the trade sanctions. 
   Last month, I introduced bipartisan legislation to end the Cuba trade embargo, the Trade Normalization With Cuba Act of 2000. Senator DODD, who is the main author of today's amendment, is one of the cosponsors of my bill to eliminate this special category we have created just for Cuba. 
   For the past 10 years, I have worked to normalize U.S. trade with China. I am working to end the Cuban embargo for many of the same reasons--first, and most importantly, to benefit the United States. Eliminating the embargo will provide economic opportunities for American workers, American farmers, and businesses. 
   Last week, a study was released on the impact of lifting the embargo on food and medicine--not the whole embargo, only on food and medicine. It concluded that American farmers and workers could sell $400 million in just agricultural products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated a potential Cuban market of $1 billion. 
   The second reason to lift the embargo is to encourage the development of a Cuban private sector. Since he can no longer rely on Soviet subsidies, Castro has taken steps to allow for limited development of private business, mostly in service professions. Private business leads to a middle class which demands accountability of its government and a greater say in how things are decided. 
   The third reason to end the embargo is to increase our contacts. Normal relations allow us to bring our social and ethical values. That has an impact over the years. 
   Mr. President, we have in place a policy that has not worked for forty years. It was a different world in 1960. Ending the Cuba embargo is long overdue.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has an intriguing, alluring, siren call: Let the Governors and State legislatures divert it. It sounds good on the surface. But like a lot of issues, let's stop and think about the actual consequences. 
   First of all, when we passed the last highway bill, even though we increased the amount of dollars to go from Federal gasoline taxes into the trust fund, back out to the States for highway construction, we all knew we had not even begun to fully take care of our Nation's roads, highways, and bridges. And we have not. The Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, has done study after study that shows we only meet one-half of our Nation's needs--one-half. 
   Some of you saw on television last night the report about all the red lights, people caught up in traffic. We know about the potholes. We know about roads and bridges and highways that are not up to snuff. What do we also know? We also know that our highways, as good as they are, are not as durable and as lasting as, say, some European highways, German highways. 
   Why is that? That is because so much more research and development and expense in dollars goes into that highway system to make those the best in the world. We have problems. We think we have a good highway system--it is good, but the Department of Transportation has concluded, from study after study, we are only halfway there, even with ISTEA that we passed a couple of years ago. So anybody who thinks we should start diverting money from the highway fund better think twice about whether or not we are keeping up with our Nation's highway needs. The answer is that we are not. 
   Second, the highway program is trusted by Americans. Why 
   is that? Basically because Americans know the Federal gasoline tax, as well as the State gasoline tax, goes into highway construction and maintenance and that is it. A few years ago, we decided to divert 4.3 cents, which was the additional tax we put on for highways, the gasoline tax, away from general revenues in the trust fund. We wanted to restore the trust in the highway trust fund. We did that. So basically all Federal gasoline taxes go in the highway trust fund and a small percent, half a cent, go into mass transit. The rest goes into the highway trust fund. Americans know that. They know where their dollars are going. That gives Americans confidence. 
   Not along ago, the suggestion was made to repeal the 4.3 cents. That was during a time when gasoline prices were going up. It sounded like a good idea, repeal 4.3 cents of the Federal gasoline tax, get those highway taxes down, get those gasoline taxes down. A siren song? Sounds good on the surface. What happened? We thought about it a little more and realized it was not a very good idea and we decided not to do that. We wanted to keep the 4.3 cents in the highway trust fund, knowing in the long run that is much more in our national interest. 
   This trust is very important. I can see this as the beginning of a slippery slope, giving Government discretion to take money out of the fund for Amtrak. Then what is next after that? We start to nibble away at the trust. 
   One other point, the highway system in America is a National Highway System.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I will take 2. 
   This is a National Highway System. What does that mean? President Eisenhower saw this. It was his conception. As a young soldier, he traveled across America and realized the highway system needed help. That means we know, as we travel across the country, that the highways in Montana, New Jersey, Ohio--highways around the country are all in pretty good shape. It is a National Highway System. What is going to happen? I have the highest respect for my friends from New Jersey and Delaware. What is going to happen in those States which are essentially, by comparison, Amtrak States? They are not highway States; they are Amtrak States. We know what is going to happen. Those Governors and legislators are going to say we are going to take money out of the highway trust fund. Because we don't have as many highways in our State, we are going to Amtrak. 
   What are Americans going to think when the highways in those States start to deteriorate? It is no longer a National Highway System. The same thing about Amtrak. One Governor says Amtrak; the one next-door says, no, not Amtrak. It gets to be quilt work, gets to be patchwork, it gets to be confused, and we do not have a national system anymore. 
   I think we need to expand Amtrak. I am a strong Amtrak supporter--very strong. But the way to do it is not here on the floor saying Governors decide what a national Amtrak program is. The way to do it is for the Congress of the United States to do its business and come back with a national Amtrak program. That is the way to do it. 
   We have a budget surplus here. Let's talk about Amtrak in the context of how we put a national Amtrak program together, and not say Governors do this and do that and sometimes some States will have a little more highway money. 
   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to not succumb to this siren song because in the long run, it is going to hurt us.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the successful completion of the Fourth Annual Mansfield Pacific Retreat. The focus of this retreat centered upon ``Urban Air Quality Issues in the Asia-Pacific Region.'' 
   Pacific Rim air quality is very timely and important matter for discussion. Environmental and public health research in the United States and Asia has increasingly shown that people living in urban areas are exposed to high levels of pollutants. This exposure can cause many impacts such as developmental problems in children, asthma, pneumonia, cancer, and even premature death in the elderly or sensitive populations. The U.S. has removed lead from its fuel supply for several of these reasons. Soon, because of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 which I shepherded through the Congress, EPA will be issuing a comprehensive urban air toxins reduction strategy. I am hopeful that this will be a model for other nations to consider. 
   I applaud the Mansfield Retreats' participants to discuss these critical issues in depth, and I look forward to their recommendations about how to resolve these issues.  
   Along, that line, Mr. President, I would like to insert for the RECORD the Final Retreat Declaration. 
   Mansfield Pacific Retreat--Final Declaration 
   The Fourth Annual Mansfield Pacific Retreat was held in Kumamoto, Japan from May 29-June 1, hosted by the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center of the University of Montana and with special support from the Kumamoto Prefectural Government. 
   The theme of the Fourth Annual Retreat was ``Common Issues--Shared Solutions: Environmental Issues and Technology in the Asia-Pacific Region.'' The Retreat participants placed emphasis on urban air equality and discussed solutions to these common problems via new technologies and partnerships. 
   The Retreat featured representation from Japan, South Korea, China and the United States. Delegates were drawn from the sectors of government, academia, non-governmental organizations and private corporations. 
   In discussing the topic of urban air quality, the Retreat participants focused on the following observations. First, there was a clear consensus that environmental problems in the urban context extended across borders and were truly transnational in their nature. Delegates acknowledged that solutions to these problems needed to focus on greater collaboration among affected governments and societies across the Asia-Pacific region for the benefit of our children and planet. At the same time, there was recognition of the important and timely contributions that participants outside the government could provide. 
   Representatives from among the private sector acknowledged their involvement in urban environmental issues and offered insight on the availability of new and appropriate technologies. In addition, the participants confirmed that they would maintain the trust and relationships established through the Retreat in order to address shared problems in local, regional, and international contexts. 
   Retreat members paid tribute to the efforts of Senator and Ambassador Mike Mansfield who has devoted nearly six decades of his life to fostering greater understanding among nations in Asia. The participants expressed their appreciation to representatives from Montana and Minamata who shared their experiences in how communities have responded to local environmental crises. The accounts related to the Clark Fork River cleanup in Montana and Minamata City's transformation into a model environmental city. 
   The Retreat participants offered tribute to the late Governor George Fukushima whose dynamic vision made the Mansfield Pacific Retreat a reality in Kumamoto. At the same time, delegates thanked Governor Shiotani for her support of the Retreat. The tireless efforts of the Kumamoto Prefectural and Mansfield Center staffs in organizing and supporting the Retreat were appreciated. 
   In conclusion, the Retreat delegates noted that the Fifth Retreat will be held in Glacier National Park, Montana in September 2001.  
   Mr. President, I believe that this declaration is evidence of a commendable venture of which I have had the honor of participating in the past three successful events. Over the years, it has been a pleasure to work with Madame Li Xiaolin and the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Dr. Phillip West and Ambassador Mark Johnson from the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center in Missoula, Montana. Their vision, dedication and cooperation make the Retreats a success year after year. 
   I congratulate them and look forward to the fifth annual Mansfield Pacific Retreat when it will be held in my home state of Montana next year.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with Senator MOYNIHAN in introducing the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. This legislation provides a tax incentive to stimulate rapid deployment of high-speed communication services to residential, rural, and low-income areas. 
   Although our nation continues to experience a period of unprecedented economic growth, it is important to remember that this growth is not shared evenly throughout the country. My State, Montana, is unfortunately an example of areas in which the economy continues to lag behind the rest of the nation. Montana is ranked last in per-capita earned income and first in the number of people holding multiple jobs. Our children and grandchildren are constantly faced with a difficult dilemma--will they be able to find jobs in Montana, where they can continue to enjoy living in ``the last great place'', or will they be forced to move elsewhere just to be able to earn a decent wage. More and more of them are choosing to leave, costing Montana some of her best and brightest young people, and along with them much of our hope for the future. 
   One of the keys to turning our State's economy around is to make sure the appropriate infrastructure is in place so that we can attract the kinds of businesses that will provide jobs for ourselves and our children. I have worked for years as ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee to ensure that Montana and other rural states receive our fair share of highway construction funds, so that the transportation infrastructure of our great State can support economic growth. 
   But today's economy is not just about bricks and mortar. Technology is  transforming traditional ways of doing business, as it is creating entirely new forms of business that never existed before. And high-speed Internet access is the key to advancing technological growth. 
   The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 provides graduated tax credits for deployment of high-speed communications to residential and rural communities. It gives a 10 percent credit for the deployment of at least 1.5 million bits per second downstream and 200,000 bits per second upstream to all subscribers--residential, business, and institutions--in rural and low income areas. This is what we call the ``current generation'' broadband. The bill also gives a 20 percent credit for the deployment of at least 22 million bits per second downstream and 10 million bits per second upstream to all subscribers in rural and low income areas, and to all residential customers in other areas. This is what we are calling ``next generation'' broadband. 
   Mr. President, as we look around us today and see the many streets that are being torn-up to lay cables for high-speed communication, and the communication dishes that are constantly ``sprouting'' from our buildings, we may wonder why we need a tax credit to advance an industry that is already growing by leaps and bounds. The reason, again, is that this growth is most extensive in selected areas. Market forces are driving deployment of high-speed communication capabilities almost exclusively to urban businesses and wealthy households. Rural businesses and rural families like those in Montana again find themselves at the back of the line. And by the time our turn comes for this technology, the rest of the country will already be well into the next technological generation. The Digital Divide, which is already a wedge between our citizens, will be perpetuated and grow into a chasm. 
   This bill is designed to even the playing field. By giving private industry economic incentives to accelerate high-speed communication capabilities to Americans who are at the end of the line, we will help people like my constituents in Montana share in our nation's economic growth. 
   As a member of the Senate Broadband Caucus, which was established to develop solutions to the problem of bringing high-speed Internet access to rural and underserved areas, I have worked hard on initiatives which would help rural areas bridge the Digital Divide. These initiatives include: the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act, which provides $5 billion in low interest loans for broadband development; the Rural Telework Act of 2000, to provide grants to develop National Centers for Distance Working which would provide access to technology and training for rural residents; the Universal Service Support Act, which lifts the cap on the universal service support fund for rural telecommunications providers; and the amendment I offered to the Rural Television Bill, to give consideration to projects which offer high speed Internet access in addition to television programming. 
   I believe these initiatives, along with the Broadband Internet Access Act we are introducing today, will go a long way toward finally bridging the growing Digital Divide and help rural areas grow and flourish. With this legislation, I hope to create an economic environment that will make sure Montana's children and grandchildren will no longer have to sacrifice enjoying the beauty of the ``last great place'' in order to earn a living wage.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators CHAFEE, LAUTENBERG, and SMITH in introducing the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act. This bill is a ``win-win.'' It is good for the environment. It is good for communities. And it is good for the economy. More hazardous waste sites will be cleaned up. We'll have more parks and open space, more economic redevelopment, and more jobs. 
   I'd like to emphasize that this is not just an east-coast, big city bill. Montana may not have as many brownfields as some of our more industrialized and densely-populated states, but our economic history has left us with our share. Wood treatment facilities. Railroad yards. Sawmills. Getting these sites remediated and back in use makes good sense in Montana and throughout the country. 
   The Brewery Flats site outside Lewistown is a perfect example of a place where this bill can really make a difference in Montana. This 57 acre site is located on the Big Spring Creek flood plain, two miles south of Lewistown. It is a railroad site, consisting of a former branch line, railroad switching yard, and roundhouse locomotive service facility. Chicago-Milwaukee railroad operated the site, then sold it to Burlington Northern. The city would like to acquire the site and convert it to recreational and educational uses. The owner is willing to transfer the land to the city, but the city needs to have a more complete understanding of the extent of the contamination before moving acquiring the land and undertaking a cleanup. 
   The site has outstanding potential to enhance the community. It is adjacent to land on the Big Spring Creek that is owned by Montana Fish and Wildlife, so cleaning it up will allow the expansion of existing open space. Big Spring Creek itself is a blue-ribbon trout stream, and the Brewery Flats site boasts several wetland areas. Local students have planted trees in the area, and the educational and recreational potential of these adjacent sites is excellent. 
   Lewistown has worked hard to utilize existing programs and resources. Montana DEQ performed some initial sampling on the site several years ago. More recently, EPA conducted a targeted site assessment, which revealed light contamination on half of the site, and more extensive contamination near the roundhouse. Although EPA did not find anything alarming, the assessment is a first cut, and the city does not feel comfortable taking ownership of the property before more extensive sampling is done. Lacking the resources to do this work, Lewistown has applied for an EPA brownfields ``showcase communities'' grant. This process is still pending. In addition, the city has applied to the Montana DNRC for a cleanup grant. 
   The brownfields bill could greatly help Lewistown acquire and clean up Brewery Flats. And it could do the same for hundreds of sites in Montana and thousands around the country, by providing funding for brownfields revitalization programs, by giving liability protection in certain cases, and by providing funding and increased authority to state brownfields cleanup programs. 
   Let me explain each of these provisions. 
   Title I of the bill authorizes funding to states, tribes and local government to inventory, assess, and remediate brownfield sites. Funding is particularly critical for sites that will be used for non-profit purposes, such as parks. In some cases, it is also needed to fill gaps in private financing at sites that will be redeveloped for commercial use. To make the funding as effective as possible, it is structured to provide states, tribes and local governments the flexibility to utilize the brownfields money and EPA's capacity in the way that best suits their particular needs. 
   For site assessment, states, tribes and local governments can seek grants from EPA. For remediation, governments that wish to establish a program can seek grants to capitalize revolving loan funds for remediation. Out of these revolving loan funds, they can then provide loans, and grants to public and nonprofit entities, for remediation. Governments that do not wish to establish revolving loan funds, on the other hand, can seek grants from EPA for specific remediation projects. In addition, Title I authorizes EPA to conduct brownfields-related technical assistance and job training and facilitate community participation. 
   This package of funding and EPA authority builds on the successes of EPA's existing brownfields program, and strengthens it by adding increased flexibility. To serve all of these purposes, Title I authorizes $150 million per year for five years. I note that, at my urging, the bill includes mine-scarred lands in the definition of brownfields and contains a provision that will ensure that funds are distributed fairly between urban and rural areas. 
   Turning to Title II of the bill, Superfund's critics have long argued that the threat of Superfund liability has been a drag on the redevelopment of brownfields sites. Title II addresses this problem by protecting several classes of persons from Superfund liability. It protects contiguous property owners, whose property has been contaminated solely by migration of contamination from contiguous property. It protects bona fide prospective purchasers, who exercise appropriate care when purchasing property and did not contribute to any existing contamination. And it protects innocent landowners, who did not have reason to know of and did not contribute to contamination of property they already own. 
   These provisions make Superfund more fair, and will promote brownfields redevelopment by providing certainty to property owners and developers about what they need to do to avoid Superfund liability. 
   Title III clarifies the relationship between state cleanup programs and EPA's Superfund program. Superfund critics have long argued that the possibility that EPA could second-guess state-approved cleanups has discouraged brownfields remediation. At the same time, I and other have argued that we need to preserve the federal government's ability to use Superfund authorities to deal with dangerous situations at sites cleaned up under state programs in the rare case in which the cleanup is inadequate and there is a threat to human health or the environment. 
   The tension between these two views has been one of the major obstacles to moving brownfields legislation in the past. This bill forges a new compromise on this issue, one that should appeal to both sides in the debate. On the one hand, it gives more certainty to those who clean up brownfield sites under state programs. On the other hand, it preserves EPA's ability to use Superfund authorities to address serious problems. 
   Mr. President, putting these changes all together, the bill will expedite cleanups at Brewery Flats and all across the country. That, again, is good for the environment, good for communities, and good for the country. 
   One final point. This bill reflects a moderate, bipartisan, compromise. It shows that we can roll up our sleeves and resolve our differences. 
   For that, I complement the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator SMITH, and the chairman of the Superfund Subcommittee, Senator CHAFEE. They've done a great job. 
   I'd also like to pay a special complement to the ranking member of the Subcommittee, Senator LAUTENBERG. He has accomplished many things during his 18 years in the Senate. One of the most important has been his leadership on environmental issues. More than anyone else, he has protected, and improved, the Superfund program. 
   If we enact the Chafee-Lautenberg bill this year, and I believe we can, it  will be a fitting capstone to his Senate career.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade Injury Compensation Act of 2000. I am joined in this effort by Senator BOND, my fellow co-chairman of the Senate Beef Caucus, and Senators BINGAMAN, DORGAN, DASCHLE, and KERREY. 
   The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund to help the United States cattle industry withstand the European Union's illegal ban on beef treated with hormones. 
   Over a year ago, the World Trade Organization endorsed retaliation when the EU refused to open to American beef. Since that time, the EU has continued to stall in its compliance which is frankly, outrageous. For over a decade we've fought the beef battle. Now its time to try something new to help producers who continue to be injured by the ban. 
   The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using the tariffs imposed on the EU to directly aid U.S. beef producers. Normally, the additional tariff revenues received from retaliation go to the Treasury.  This bill establishes a trust fund so that the affected industry will receive those revenues as compensation for its injury. 
   Our legislation authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants to a nationally recognized beef promotion and research board for the education and market promotion of the United States beef industry. In particular, the fund shall:

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and Senators ROBERTS, DORGAN, and LINCOLN, to introduce the Trade Normalization With Cuba Act of 2000. 
   For 40 years, we have implemented a series of policies designed to end Fidel Castro's leadership of Cuba. The instruments we have used have included a trade embargo, an invasion of Cuba, assassination attempts, and multilateral pressures. None of these measures has moved Cuba any closer to democracy and a market economy. In fact, the result has been just the opposite. Castro is as entrenched as ever. The economy is in tatters. The Cuban people are suffering. 
   For four decades, Castro has suppressed his own citizens. He has been responsible for the imprisonment and mistreatment of thousands, and the emigration of hundreds of thousands. He has dispatched Cuban troops around the world to support revolution. 
   During the Cold War, Cuba was an integral member of the Soviet bloc. Castro was an eager and active participant in the proxy battles fought between the United States and the Soviet Union throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
   The Cold War has been over for a decade. The embargo, which had the goal of forcing Castro out of power, has failed totally. And it will continue to have no impact on the longevity of Castro's rule. 
   What has the embargo and American policy actually done? It has certainly done nothing to advance liberty and democracy for the Cuban people. And there are no prospects that it will. 
   What has the embargo done? First, it prohibits all trade with Cuba. It does include an exception for the sale of food and medicine. However, the requirements are so complex and burdensome on U.S. suppliers that very little food or medicine has been exported to Cuba. We hurt the Cuban people. We hurt American business, American farmers, and American workers. And we have had no impact on the regime. 
   We have succeeded in alienating virtually all potential allies who would be willing to work with us in developing a realistic policy to influence change in Cuba--the nations of the European Union, Canada, the Organization of American States, the United Nations, even the Pope. 
   Another accomplishment of our policy of our trade embargo, we now have a law, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, that prohibits lifting the embargo until there is a transition government in Cuba that does not include Castro. This is an ``all or nothing policy'' that cannot work in the real world. 
   Unilateral trade sanctions don't work. This is as true with Cuba as it has been with China, Myanmar, Iraq, or North Korea. In some cases, it hurts the people in those countries. And it hurts Americans, our farmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses. 
   Forty years of sanctions have accomplished nothing in Cuba. It is time for the Congress to recognize that. I fully support the efforts being made again this year in both the Senate and the House to remove the unilateral restraints we have put on our export of food and medicine to a number of countries, including Cuba. This bill is not a substitute for those efforts. Rather, this bill is directed only toward Cuba, and goes far beyond liberalization of food and medicine exports. 
   Thomas Jefferson said ``Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of the day.'' Current US policy turns Jefferson's statement on its head. Our effort to isolate Cuba through the trade embargo and other policies has failed to bring human rights improvement, has provided a pretext for Castro's continued repression, makes the United States the scapegoat for Castro's failed economic policies, and hurts the Cuban people. 
   It is time to put together a responsible strategy to improve the human condition in Cuba and set the stage for increased freedom and respect for human rights once Fidel Castro leaves the scene. 
   Obviously, Cuba will not change overnight with the removal of the trade embargo. But this bill is a first step down the road to a peaceful transition to a democratic society and a market economy in Cuba. 
   Before I conclude, I want to recognize my friend, Congressman Charles Rangel, who has been a leader in trying to end the embargo and move toward normalization of relations with Cuba. I look forward to working closely with him to make this happen. 
   I urge my Senate colleagues to support our effort.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a select few individuals from my home state of Montana. I have personally nominated these individuals to represent Montana in the Library of Congress' Local Legacies Project as part of their Bicentennial Celebration. The Local Legacies project has allowed citizens to participate directly in this great celebration. The participants have documented America's grassroots heritage in every state, the U.S. Trusts and Territories, and the District of Columbia. Their documentation provides  a snapshot of the nation's unique traditions as we begin a new century. My nominees for Montana's Local Legacies have worked hard to represent the beauty and deeply rooted heritage of our rugged and wide open state. The survival of our heritage is important for knowing not only where we came from, but where we are going. And for this, I commend them. 
   Native Reign, is composed of Northern Cheyenne youth to promote the need for education, respect for the environment, development of personal skills, respect of tribal elders and a strong spiritual foundation. They have been supported by their adult leader Ken Bisonette and his efforts to make Native Reign the role model it has become. They combine traditional Native American dances, skits, with contemporary music to celebrate the history and traditions of the tribe. On April 9, 1999, they received the Governor's Award at the State Capitol Building in Helena from Montana Governor Marc Racicot for their success in showing Montana youth an alternative lifestyle to teen pregnancy, drugs and alcohol abuse, gangs, and violence. They are a role model for not only the young people of Montana, but for the rest of the United States as well. Congratulations Native Reign, you are truly a legacy! 
   Mike Logan, Montana's very own Cowboy Poet has contributed a book of poetry illustrated with original photographs he took during his travels throughout our breathtaking state. His book is entitled ``Montana Is.. . .'' Mike wanted to share some of the beauty he had been privileged to experience and photograph in his 21 years living in Montana. As part of his introduction to the book, Mike states: ``I love everything about Montana....... I still feel like I'm spending every day in heaven.'' Words that ring so true to my own heart. Mike paints a verbal and visual picture true to the very poetic nature of Montana's scenic beauty and spectacular wildlife. I would encourage everyone to pick up his book and take a journey into Montana's rich heritage. Thank you Mike, your poetry is one more part of our history we are lucky to have! 
   The Metis Project: When they Awake--was created and produced by Helena Presents, a production, presentation and film center based in Helena, Montana. It is a celebration of the extraordinary legacy of fiddle music of the Metis people. The project explores the musical and social legacy of a tribe without boundaries, whose heritage results from marriage between Indians and Europeans throughout the Northern Plains from Sault St. Marie, Michigan, to Choteau, Montana, across both sides of the 49th parallel. Central to the project is the creation of a new musical work that references the indigenous American rhythms and diverse European fiddle heritage that is present in Metis music. The name of the presentation is based on a prediction of Louis Riel, a teacher, writer, and hero to the Metis people:  
   My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they awake, it will be the artists who give them their spirit back.  
   Composer and performers Philip Aaberg and Darol Anger collaborated with master Metis fiddler, Jimmie LaRocque to revive once again the melodious spirit of the Metis people. Gentlemen, I take my hat off to you! 
   Five St. Ignatius High School students from St. Ignatius, Montana, who present and preserve their area's native traditions using interviews with farmers and ranchers of the Mission Valley of Montana along with poignant photographs which paint a dramatic picture of farm life in the Mission Valley. The report summarizing their findings was written by their teacher Marta Brooks. Students in Brooks's English and history classes used the ``heritage education'' approach to the study of local culture. They collected stories, oral histories, historical documents, art and geological information that reflect the unity of landscape and culture. Montana's traditional farmers and ranchers are becoming a dying breed so because of the change in the local landscape with the inevitable change in the local culture the students were prompted to initiate this project as a way to document and preserve the area's native culture and traditions before they cease to exist. Thank you all for your efforts to immortalize our rich agricultural heritage. Your hard work brings a lot of pride to Montana! 
   Montana Horse Story, was brought to us through the use of still photography, film, and field reporting, by a mother/son team, Allison and Joshua Collins. Allison and Joshua are part of a company called Related Images. Their project documents the legacy of the horse for work, transportation, and recreation as preserved by various Montana events such as rodeo, the Miles City Bucking Horse Sale, Indian rodeo, and O-mok-see. Their work was last seen locally, in an exhibit of rodeo photography, at the Holter Museum, in Helena, Mt. Much like the other Local Legacies projects, Montana Horse Story pinpoints a vital part of Montana's rich traditions, that without it we would not be the people that we have become. Joshua and Allison, you have captured our spirit in some of its best moments. Without your talents and dedication, our story would never be heard. Thank you! 
   I conclude with one final remark: Without the hard work of all these individuals, Montana's rich cultural heritage may never be known. You should all be very proud of your efforts. I know Montanans are. And I most certainly am.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator ROBERTS to include an amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill which will benefit both the United States and China. 
   In particular, Mr. President, our amendment allows United States business to include China in the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership. The time is ripe for such action, particularly as China prepares to enter the rules-based trading system we know as the World Trade Organization. China's participation is good news for China and better news for United States business. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has already shown its support for including China in the Asian Environmental Partnership through passage of an identical amendment in the 105th Congress. However, such efforts were stifled in conference. Now is the opportune time to take up and pass this amendment and I urge my colleagues to join Senator ROBERTS and me in this endeavor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Montana's Law Enforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty. These individuals have given their lives protecting the innocent and I can think of no more noble endeavor. 
   We have recently considered a resolution that will make May 15th a national memorial day for peace officers. I think it is high time that the nation joins Montana in setting aside time to honor our law enforcement officers. For the past twelve years Montana has celebrated the dedication of its law enforcement officers on this day. I wish to commend Terry Tyler and the other members of the Professional Justice Community of Montana whose hard work and sacrifice to preserve and recognize the officers who have died in the line of duty are the best examples of the ``Montana Spirit'' that I know so well. I was pleased to support that resolution as I am pleased to commend and commemorate the Montana Law Enforcement Museum for its continuing commitment to honoring our fallen law enforcement officers who placed public safety before their own. 
   Montana law enforcement traditions can be traced back to April 1863 when Henry Plummer became the state's first elected sheriff. Since that time Montana's law enforcement officers have been charged with the protection and defense of the public and our laws. In Montana, our citizens enjoy a life style not marred by daily occurrences of gun violence and crime. Our children do not feel threatened in our schools and it is commonplace to leave your door unlocked. I can think of no greater testament to the hard work and dedication of our law enforcement officers and the people of Montana who support their efforts. 
   It is only right that we take a day to remember those who have died so that others may live in a safe and secure environment. It is an honor and privilege to stand and recognize the efforts of these people and those who will not let their efforts go unnoticed. So, I wish to close with gratitude for those individuals who have dedicated their labors to a higher cause and who continually put their lives on the line to protect me and my family. On behalf of the state of Montana and the Nation, thank you.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the innovative work of the Drug Treatment Court in Gallatin County, Montana. 
   Recently I worked for a day at the Drug Court, where I witnessed the process of evaluating drug court cases and determining who was following the rules--and who was not. 
   I must say, Mr. President, I was very impressed and inspired by the whole process--Judge Olson, his staff, the prosecutors, defense attorneys, parole and probation officer, counselors. And, most important of all, the people who have voluntarily decided to turn their lives around. This pilot project in Bozeman, Montana should be replicated around the state and nation. 
   In the morning, I sat in on the briefing, where judges and all the parties involved in sanctioning defendants discussed--with compassion and sometimes frustration--their attempts to help these people get off and stay off of drugs and alcohol. 
   Their discussions centered not on punishment, but on finding common-sense ways to help these people addicted to drugs and alcohol find ways to improve their lives and be positive contributors to their communities. 
   And, sitting later in court, I saw the genuine and sincere attempts of the defendants to correct their lives and stay out of jail. 
   Judge Olson was remarkable. He mixed just the right amount of compassion with tough love to help the defendants. 
   He counseled them, warned them, cajoled them, and told them he personally would help them find jobs so they could stay ``clean.'' His work is to be highly commended and copied throughout Montana. 
   The defendants also showed that they can beat drugs and alcohol. One middle-aged man told me later that the Treatment Court was the best thing that ever happened in his life. He had become clean for the first time in 30 years. He owed his life to the Treatment Court. Now he is trying to find ways to help other people. 
   The Treatment Court is a success story waiting to be copied. It is a way to keep people out of jail, off the streets and in a job. 
   Yes, some people slip up and don't abide by the rules. When they do, Judge Olson cracks down on them. But when they succeed, Judge Olson praises them, and shakes their hand. 
   His personal involvement in the lives of these people shows that justice does know compassion, that courts can be places where people headed for jail can make a detour--and be given a chance to redirect their lives. Mr. President, I want to say that I was inspired by what I saw last Friday in Treatment Court in Bozeman. And I want to help to find funding for the Bozeman Treatment Court, as well as funding for similar courts throughout Montana. 
   Such an investment in people--in helping them become positive citizens in their communities rather than burdens--will save us money--and lives--in the long run. 
   And I will also work hard to help the Treatment Court find funds to help defendants locate affordable housing, get a good education and good jobs. What struck me, Mr. President, was that many of the defendants suffered from a lack of education. My work day in Treatment 
   Court reminded of the importance and power of education, as well as the importance of creating good-paying jobs. 
   Along with families, they are the building blocks of a strong and health society, and help keep people off drugs and alcohol. 
   Count me a supporter of this successful program. 
   The treatment court idea embodies steps crucial to curbing the influence of drugs on our society. 
   Nationally, such treatment courts are a relatively new idea. The first drug courts were created in Florida in 1989, under the supervision of Janet Reno. 
   She and others realized that the solution to the rising number of drug related cases was not to increase the capacity of the criminal justice system--but to reduce the number of drug users.  
   The Gallatin Treatment Court is only seven months old. And while its first participants have yet to graduate, based on my experience I believe most will succeed. 
   Roger Curtiss, who works with the Drug Court and heads the non-profit Alcohol and Drug Services program of Gallatin County, told me how he overcame his own drug addiction problems after being placed in a similar program. 
   I also learned what a dedicated and talented staff Roger has supporting him in his efforts to reduce the scourge of drugs. 
   I remain committed to fighting illegal drug use in Montana. While I believe that treatment courts such as Gallatin County's will play an increasing role in the fight against drugs, other steps must be taken. 
   In January I invited drug czar Barry McCaffrey to Montana for a conference. He spoke to dozens of Montanans about the challenge posed by methamphetamine and other drugs. 
   One experience sticks out in particular. At the town hall meeting we had a man named Wayne approach the microphone to address the group. He fidgeted as he told his story about being addicted to meth for nearly 20 years. He said, ``People don't understand the affect of this drug. It tears the brains up. It rips the family apart. It has a hold that never lets go.'' 
   Mr. President, Wayne is not alone. Across Montana and rural America, meth and other drugs are tearing families--and communities--apart. 
   In January the DEA reported that eighth graders in rural America are 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban counterparts. And they are 104 percent more likely to use meth. 
   The bottom line is that drugs destroy lives and communities. 
   The solution to the ongoing fight against drugs will be found only through constant innovation of the type demonstrated by Gallatin County's Treatment Court and similar programs across the nation. 
   To that end I have introduced legislation to make Montana part of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. 
   The bill would allow Montana to embark on an intensive, statewide media campaign and hire additional personnel for methamphetamine prosecution. 
   And because WHAT you know depends so much on WHO you know, the measure would establish a state-wide criminal intelligence network, allowing law-enforcement officials in all 56 counties to share information on criminal activity. 
   Mr. President, if I learned one thing from my meetings with the General McCaffrey and last Friday's visit to the treatment court, it is that there are many committed individuals fighting the drug problem. 
   The trick is to get them all together working to the same end: treatment, prevention and law enforcement must all coordinate their efforts to fight the scourge of drugs. 
   We in Congress must do the same. At the end of last session the Senate passed legislation to fight meth, by beefing up law enforcement and treatment resources throughout the nation. 
   Both S. 486--sponsored by Senator ASHCROFT--and an amendment to the Bankruptcy Bill--sponsored by Senator HATCH--passed the Senate. 
   Unfortunately, both bills have languished in the House of Representatives. Neither has been acted upon, and the legislative days for the 106th Congress are numbered. I urge my colleagues in the House to act now to strengthen resources in the fight against illegal drugs, meth in particular. 
   Finally, I want to again recognize the efforts of the Bozeman Drug Court and thank them for allowing me to witness their innovative and inspiring work first-hand. 
   Drug Court is an alternative, but it's not easy. For many it is just as difficult as serving time. 
   In fact, I witnessed one individual who, after continually breaking the rules, was kicked out of drug court. Now he faces five years of jail time. 
   But with our jails bursting at the seams and the drug problem mushrooming in rural areas, I believe the Drug Court is an effective tool in fighting the drug problem we face. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for American men and women serving overseas in our Armed Services. These men and women are faced with difficult missions--made even more difficult by the fact that they are serving far from home and loved ones. 
   Despite these difficulties, the men and women of our armed forces have met every expectation, fulfilled every mission, and upheld the trust of the American people. This is especially commendable because over the last several years, our Armed Forces have been charged with restoring peace and maintaining order in some of the most intractable conflicts around the globe. 
   Out of many service members, one individual I am proud to recognize is Army Staff Sgt. Travis Elliston. I am proud to say that he is a Montana native, from the town of Kalispell. Elliston is a squad leader with Company B, 3rd Battalion, 504th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C. 
   During his time in Vrbovac, Kosovo, Elliston has shown the dedication and  innovation required in today's military. 
   The quality of his work is reflected in his own words. In a February interview with Stars and Stripes Magazine, Elliston spoke about his work with Vrbovac's residents--many of whom are just now returning after fleeing their homes. Describing his work with town residents, Elliston said, ``I try to put a smile on their faces and give them hope that we will protect them.'' 
   This protection has taken many forms. One Vrbovac resident told Stars and Stripes, ``Before Elliston came here, we locked all the doors. Now that [Elliston] is here we leave the doors open every night because we feel much more safe with him here.'' Elliston and the men and women serving with him have also been able to put an end to many killings, hijackings and kidnapings. 
   Elliston has also spearheaded measures to improve the quality of life in Kosovo. He has taken steps to facilitate the spread of news from the outside world to local residents and has even installed speed bumps to solve the problem of speeding vehicles. 
   These are but a few examples illustrating the dedication and innovation of Elliston and those serving with him. It is these qualities upon which our nation depends. 
   The same Vrbovac resident said of Elliston, ``The people in Montana must be proud because he is a great man.'' I am here today to say that the people of Montana are proud. We are proud of Elliston, and we are also proud of all the other men and women who serve overseas. These sacrifice and dedication of these individuals must be recognized and I call on my colleagues in the Senate to do so. 
   Thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Conference Report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000. It is important to remind everyone this is the first substantive trade bill we have passed since the Uruguay Round implementation bill in 1994. It is about time. We Americans have, by far, the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. We are the world's only superpower. We better act like one. And that means taking leadership on global trade issues and trade policy, not burying our heads in the sand. Completion of this bill is a first step. Passage of PNTR for China is another. 
   I would like to make several general comments about this legislation. Then I will highlight some of its major sections and explain why they are in the best interest of the United States. 
   In two weeks, the House is scheduled to vote on whether to extend permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China. The Senate vote will follow. I am confident that it will pass in both houses. These two pieces of legislation have a common underlying set of principles. 
   First, a market-based economy, the rule of law, and the reduction and elimination of barriers to foreign trade. These all lead to greater growth, both for our trade partners domestically, as well as and for the global economy. 
   Second, greater interchange of goods, services, investment, and people between the United States and developing countries. This leads, over the long-run, to domestic stability in those nations, and greater global stability. 
   Third, if the United States were to turn inward today, we would be turning our back on a global trade and economic system that has brought us to the greatest height of prosperity in the history of the world. 
   Although the disparities in income around the world are greater than in the past, hundreds of millions of people have been raised out of poverty over the last two decades. We need to do a lot more to ensure that people in America and people overseas are not passed over by this growth. But raising trade barriers, reversing trade liberalization, and halting our efforts to open markets around the world is not the answer. That would only worsen income disparities and increase the number of people living in poverty. 
   The outcome of our conference is not perfect. It never is. But the result is absolutely in our national interest. 
   The two major sections of the bill are the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. The Africa portion is but one step in bringing Africa into the global economic system. And in promoting development on this terribly poor continent. 
   Many of the problems of Africa are home grown. Many of the problems are the vestige of totally inept and irresponsible colonial rule. 
   We can provide ways, in this case through economic development, industrial growth, and debt relief, for Africa to begin to emerge from its cycle of poverty. 
   The Caribbean Basin was put at a competitive disadvantage once NAFTA came into effect. This bill brings the CBI nations up to parity with Mexico. At the same time, it requires important commitments from those nations on intellectual property rights, on WTO obligations, on participation in negotiations in the free trade area of America, on fighting the war against corruption, on respecting internationally recognized worker rights, and on protecting against the worst forms of child labor. 
   Under this bill, a country in Africa or the Caribbean must commit to protect internationally recognized worker rights in order to receive benefits. Congress has debated the issue of the relationship between trade and labor for years. I am very pleased we have acted in support of one of the most basic sets of human rights. I hope this is an indication that we will start making real progress in reconciling trade and labor in future trade legislation. 
   Let me mention several other provisions of the bill that are of particular import. I deeply regret the provision passed by this Senate to provide trade adjustment assistance for farmers was not included in the conference report. Our farmers have suffered as much as any sector of our economy. Yet they fall between the cracks in our TAA policy, and that was not the intention when trade adjustment assistance was originally conceived. 
   As a compromise, the Secretary of Labor must submit a report examining the applicability to farmers of trade adjustment assistance programs. Further, the Secretary must make recommendations, either to approve the operation of those programs as they apply to farmers, or to establish a new program for farmers. These provisions are utterly inadequate. I guarantee we will revisit this issue. Farmers suffering adversely from the impact of trade should be provided with the means to adjust, just as factory workers do today. 
   I strongly support the provision establishing a chief agricultural negotiator at USTR, with the rank of ambassador. Agriculture is at the core of our economy and our society, and our agricultural trade negotiators need this high visibility to represent American interests properly. 
   I might add that agriculture disparities around the world are the only major remaining trade distortion not yet addressed either in GATT or WTO. It is agriculture trade distortions which are the major remaining significant barrier to trade with which we have not yet dealt. 
   I am very pleased this effort includes provisions dealing with the ways we deal with products made with forced or indentured child labor. Every time I hear that phrase ``forced or indentured child labor,'' I get chills down my spine. It bothers all of us when we hear that. This conference report also includes provisions to deal with that and it includes new eligibility criteria in the GSP, Generalized System of Preferences, regarding the elimination of the worst forms of child labor. 
   I wish to recognize my colleague, Senator TOM HARKIN, for his tireless efforts on behalf of the rights of children  globally. Everyone who is concerned--and we are all--with this problem should remember the name TOM HARKIN. 
   As has Senator HARKIN, I have traveled to some of the most inhospitable places in the world, and I have seen children working and living in conditions that would not be shown in a R-rated movie. I am proud to join him in supporting these measures. 
   Finally, wool tariffs. For years, there have been efforts to reduce the tariffs on the finest worsted wool. This is a complex issue affecting the manufacturers of wool suits, the manufacturers of wool fabric, the yarn spinning industry, wool growers, and retailers. The conference report provides for the temporary reduction of tariffs on a limited quantity of certain wool fabrics. It temporarily suspends the duty on certain wool yarns, fibers, and tops. And it establishes a $9 million wool research development promotion trust fund. This fund will assist wool producers in improving the quality of wool produced in the United States and help develop and promote the wool market. I welcome this thoughtful compromise that serves all concerned groups. 
   In sum, I am pleased the House has passed this comprehensive and historic trade package. I strongly support it. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. America is the world leader in promoting a market economy and knocking down trade barriers in order to improve the quality of life, both in our country and abroad. We need to continue this, first, by approving this conference report, and then, shortly, by approving PNTR for China. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. 2370. S. 2370 names  the new Foley Square Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street, New York City, after Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. But even more, I wish to pay tribute to a colleague, a mentor, and a friend. 
   When Senator MOYNIHAN retires from the Senate at the end of this year, he will be deeply and perhaps uniquely missed because he has contributed so much to our debates and, in fact, to our lives. There will be plenty of time for extended tributes later. 
   Each Senator will stand up and explain in his own words the work and wonder of Senator MOYNIHAN, particularly as the session draws to a close, and I hope to participate in those tributes at that time. 
   The bill we are considering today is also a fitting tribute for two reasons: First, one of the many special contributions that PAT MOYNIHAN has made to our Nation is the contribution to our public architecture. 
   Thomas Jefferson said:  
   Design activity and political thought are indivisible.  
   In keeping with this, PAT MOYNIHAN has sought to improve our public places so they reflect and uplift our civic culture. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, himself, said it well back in 1961. We all know he has held many important positions in Government, in fact, so many I don't think any of us can remember them all. But only recently did I learn that he once was the staff director of something called the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space. 
   That is right. He was. In addition to everything else, he once wrote a document called the ``Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture'' back in 1961. And that remains in effect today. It is one page long. It says that public buildings should not only be efficient and economical but also should ``provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American Government.'' 
   For many years, he has worked with energy and vision to put the goals expressed in the guidelines into practice. 
   As an assistant to President Kennedy, he was one of the driving forces behind the effort to renovate Pennsylvania Avenue, to finally achieve Pierre L'Enfant's vision. 
   He followed through. There is the Navy Memorial, Pershing Park, the Ronald Reagan Building, and Ariel Rios. And there are other projects. Along with John Chafee, he had the vision to restore Union Station--a magnificent building--and then to complement it with the beautiful Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building. 
   It is absolutely remarkable, leaving a lasting mark on our public places that bring us together as American citizens. 
   In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN has had a greater positive impact on American public architecture than any statesman since Thomas Jefferson. 
   That brings me to my second point. The new courthouse in 
   Foley Square bears PAT MOYNIHAN's mark. It is the Nation's largest courthouse, for the Nation's oldest Federal court. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN was the principal sponsor of the bill authorizing its construction back in 1987. And characteristically, he followed through, paying close attention to details. 
   At times, the courthouse has been controversial. But no one can deny its grandeur. It preserves history, uses space to great effect, and it features a graceful sculpture in the form of a fountain designed by Maya Lin, who also designed the Vietnam War Memorial. 
   The building itself is designed by a very distinguished American firm, Kohn Pederson Fox, and it was designed, as Senator MOYNIHAN himself has said, ``with dignity and presence.'' 
   I am sure Senator MOYNIHAN will correct me later if I am wrong, but I believe in St. Paul's Cathedral in London there is an inscription memorializing the architect of the cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren. It reads:  
   If you would see his memorial, look about you.  
   If, years from now, you stand outside the Capitol and look west, down Pennsylvania Avenue, or you stand on the steps of the Jacob Javits Federal Building in New York City and look east at the courthouse that will bear his name, you can say the same about Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN:  
   If you would see his memorial, look about you.  
   Mr. President, this bill is a fitting tribute to a distinguished scholar, an outstanding Senator, and a great American. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there have been a lot of statements on the floor, a lot of words. A lot is accurate and a lot is inaccurate. I would like to set things straight on what it is we are voting and on what it is we are not voting. 
   It has been said here that 100 percent of the benefit in the majority bill goes to married couples. That is true. But this is not a marriage relief bill we are talking about today. Marriage has its own rewards. We are not talking about a marriage relief bill. We are talking about a marriage tax penalty relief bill. 
   The proposition offered by the minority Members, all Democrats on the Finance Committee, which is the amendment we hope can be offered to solve the marriage tax penalty, is a marriage tax penalty relief bill. It is not a marriage relief bill. It is a marriage tax penalty relief bill. 
   What I am saying is 60 percent of the benefit in the majority bill goes to people who have no penalty; 100 percent of the provisions in the Democratic bill go to those who are in a penalty position. 
   Let's remember, a little over half of Americans are in a marriage bonus situation; that is, as a consequence of marriage, they pay less taxes than they would pay if they filed singly; whereas a little less than half of Americans are in a penalty position; that is, they pay more taxes as a consequence of being married compared to what they would pay if they were married filing singly. So we are addressing the marriage tax penalty by focusing our benefits on the marriage tax penalty, not on marriage relief, which is what the majority is talking about--marriage relief. 
   They must think marriage is a bad thing. They want to give 
   relief to married couples. We are giving relief to married couples who suffered a tax penalty. Marriage has its own rewards. I am surprised, frankly, the majority would think that, by implication, they have to give their benefits for the sake of marriage. 
   The proposal the Democrats are offering totally addresses marriage. It also totally addresses the marriage tax penalties. There are 65 provisions in the code today which cause a marriage tax penalty situation--65. The Democratic provision addresses all of them, all 65, so there will be no penalty consequence under the Democratic bill because of marriage. How many of the 65 penalties in the code do you think the majority bill addresses: 5? 10? 15? 20? 65? No. Three, only 3, only 3 out of the 65. 
   One of them is Social Security differentiation. That is the penalty a couple suffers as a consequence of the Social Security tax provisions affected by marriage. There are 61 others. There is a huge difference. 
   On the one hand, you have the majority that does not want to address the other 62 provisions of the code which cause a marriage tax penalty, whereas our bill addresses all of them. How does it address all of them? By saying to the taxpayers who are married: You have a choice. Your choice is this: You file singly or you file jointly. It is your choice. Whichever results in the lowest taxes, that is what you pay. 
   So it has the benefit not only of addressing all the 65 provisions of the code--theirs addresses only 3 provisions of the code--but the Democratic provision, the minority provision, also has the benefit of choice, allowing taxpayers to choose what they want to do. Not theirs. You cannot choose in theirs; this is the way it is. You only get to address 3 out of the 65 on theirs. 
   What else is going on here? The majority party wants a vote on a parliamentary procedure so many amendments--or few amendments--that both sides want to offer could not be offered. They are afraid of these amendments. They are afraid of an amendment to provide prescription drug benefits for senior citizens. They are afraid of an amendment to deal with Medicaid. They are afraid of an amendment which will help Americans provide education for their children. They are afraid of amendments on their side. They are afraid of an amendment, perhaps, dealing with estate taxes. They are afraid of that. They do not want amendments. They are afraid of them. 
   Why are they afraid of them? I don't know why they are afraid of them. They don't want the Senate to vote on these amendments, amendments which are of very great concern to a vast majority of American citizens. Frankly, that is why we are here, to try to serve the public interest by offering and voting on amendments which affect American citizens. 
   The problem, I might say, is this. There are maybe 80 legislative days this year. That is all. We have not been voting Mondays or Fridays, so there are probably about 50, that is all, remaining this year--50 days, maybe, we will have votes. If we cannot offer amendments that the American people want us to discuss and debate on this bill, when in the world are we going to have time to do it with only 50 days left? 
   Basically, the majority does not want a vote on issues that concern the American people. They also do not want a vote on a better idea on how to address the marriage penalty because technically, if cloture is invoked, the amendment offered by 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, which is the Democratic amendment--a better idea--will not be in order. It will not be in order to address all the 65 provisions of the code called the marriage tax penalty. It will not be in order for Americans to choose; that is, choose to file jointly or separately. An amendment will not be in order to allow Americans to choose. 
   It is no wonder all this smokescreen is being put up over here, playing politics, lots of folderol. Cut right down to the bone, the issue is, Should we be able to vote for a better way to address the marriage penalty or not? I think we should; therefore, that amendment should be in order. It will not be in order if cloture is invoked. They know that. They don't want us to be able to vote on that. In addition, they don't want a vote on other amendments, such as education and prescription drug benefits, which are a good idea. They don't want a vote on those. 
   That is all this comes down to. I say let's vote on a couple of these amendments. Then let's vote on which of the two marriage tax penalty provisions is best. We will be doing the American people a great service by solving the marriage tax penalty problem.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on some important events that took place here in Washington last week while many of us were back home meeting with our constituents. 
   For the past 25 years, we've had an annual Spring ritual in Washington. I'm not referring to the cherry blossoms. Every April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank hold their joint meeting. Bankers and finance ministers from around the world travel to Washington to talk about the global economy, exchange rates, poverty reduction, and the so-called ``international financial architecture.'' 
   These are tremendously important subjects. But the talks are highly technical, and the results are shrouded in the vague language of diplomatic communiques. The meetings don't produce startling breakthroughs. For most people they are hard to understand. So the annual IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington have rarely generated much news, and the participants liked it that way. 
   This year was different. A coalition of activists vowed to descend on Washington to disrupt the meetings. More than 1,700 journalists registered to cover the event. Few of those journalists came to report on IMF discussions of extended funds facilities or economic stabilization criteria. They were hoping for the kind of news that protesters made at last year's WTO meetings in Seattle when they closed the city down. 
   But those who came to Washington hoping for Seattle-style violence were disappointed. Both the police and the demonstrators are to be commended for that. Those who came here hoping to throw the meetings off track were also disappointed. Unlike the WTO ministerial in Seattle, the IMF meetings did not attract a big crowd of protestors. The labor unions stayed home. The big environmental groups were absent. So the meeting took place pretty much as scheduled, albeit with some inconvenience and no dramatic events. Business as usual. 
   There was one underlying theme among those who did come: a feeling that international economic institutions undermine the interests of ordinary citizens. I heard that on the streets of Seattle last December, when protestors took aim at the world's main trade body. And I heard it again last week when they focused on the IMF and the World Bank. The demonstrators had no confidence that those institutions are moving in the right direction. 
   This lack of confidence concerns me greatly. It exists not only here at home, but also in many other countries. I believe that America must lead an effort to restore faith in the economic institutions we have worked so hard to build over the past fifty years, economic institutions that have served our country and our people. The World Trade Organization. The IMF. The World Bank. And we in the Congress should lead that effort. 
   Look at the evidence here at home. In the trade arena, I've seen a rapid decline in the domestic consensus in favor of open markets. One result is that we've been unable to renew the President's fast track trade negotiating authority. Morever, the lack of a domestic consensus has undermined our ability to lead in the WTO. It has weakened our bargaining power. Other members, especially the EU and Japan, take advantage of our weakened position and resist opening up their markets to the production of American workers and farmers. 
   In the financial arena, last week's demonstrations showed that Americans are losing faith. They don't think that the IMF and the World Bank serve the needs of the people, especially the most vulnerable here and in other countries. Instead, they believe that the institutions serve the needs of the big and the rich. The IMF and the World Bank stand accused of mismanaging the Asian financial crisis through misguided policies which needlessly lowered the living standards of millions of people, throwing many of them back into poverty. They stand accused of mismanaging the Russian economy. 
   Are these criticisms justified? It's difficult for Americans to judge. These institutions do not operate in the daylight of public scrutiny. Although they exist on taxpayer funds, they do not hold themselves accountable to taxpayer concerns. America is the biggest shareholder in both the IMF and the World Bank. And the lack of transparency has seriously undermined American public confidence in both the IMF and the World Bank. 
   Over the past week I've read and heard a number of condescending remarks about the protestors. They've been called naive, poorly informed, misguided. But the concerns they express are real and are shared by many Americans who did not march down Pennsylvania Avenue. We need to take these concerns seriously, because they express a strong undercurrent in American thinking. 
   In my talks with representatives from the business, environmental and labor communities, I find that strong centrist elements seek practical solutions. We in the Congress can supply the political leadership to firm up this middle ground on the issues of trade and finance, trade and labor, trade and the environment, and restore confidence in the international trade and financial system. It is an important undertaking. America's ability to lead the world into an era of global prosperity benefitting rich and poor alike requires us to firm up and expand the middle ground to reforge our domestic consensus.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know there will be a lot of time for debate  later today and tomorrow, and perhaps in the future, on the so-called marriage penalty. I want to respond to two points that several of our Republican colleagues have made with respect to the Finance Committee bill, the majority bill. 
   The first claim is that the Finance Committee bill, the majority bill, eliminates the marriage penalty. Not true. It does reduce the marriage penalty for some people, to some extent, but it does not eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   Why do I say that? Well, first, let me show you this chart. This chart basically shows, in the main, that there are 65 provisions in the Tax Code that create a marriage tax penalty; 65 different provisions in the code create the so-called marriage tax penalty, the inequity that married people pay. The Republican bill, the Finance Committee bill, addresses some of them. How many? Out of the total of 65, how many do you suppose the Finance Committee addresses? A grand total of three. So 62 of the provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that cause a marriage tax penalty are not addressed by the Finance Committee bill. 
   Let me give you an example. One is the deduction for interest on student loans. The phaseout for this begins at $40,000 for unmarried individuals and about $60,000 for joint return filers. So if two young people each earn $35,000 and they marry, they get hit harder by the phaseout. In other words, they pay a marriage tax penalty. It is not covered by the Finance Committee bill. It is covered by the alternative to be offered by Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   Another example in the Finance Committee bill is not covered. A marriage tax penalty that is not taken care of is Social Security for seniors. The tax threshold for Social Security for seniors is $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples. Again, a marriage tax penalty. What does the Republican bill, the Finance Committee bill, do about these provisions? Nothing. They are not among the three penalties the Republican bill addresses. The Democratic proposal, in contrast, addresses all 65 marriage tax penalty provisions--all of them. Not 3, not 4, not 5, but all of them, all 65. 
   So, again, the Finance Committee bill does not eliminate the marriage tax penalty. The Democratic alternative does. 
   There is a second point made on the floor today that I would like to address. About half of the relief in the Finance Committee bill goes to people who don't pay a marriage tax penalty today. They get a so-called bonus, or they get neither a penalty nor a bonus. That is this chart. This chart shows that less than half of the relief in the majority bill goes to the marriage tax penalty; that is, more than half goes to people who don't have a marriage tax penalty, who are already in a bonus situation. 
   Some argue, well, gee, we should not penalize couples, such as those with a stay-at-home spouse, by denying them the same tax cut we provide to couples who face a marriage tax penalty. Frankly, that is a red herring, as lawyers say. That is totally beside the point. Obviously, we have nothing against people who receive a tax bonus. Nobody wants to penalize them. But let's be honest. If we are providing half the relief to people who don't pay a marriage tax penalty, it is simply not a marriage tax penalty bill anymore; it is a tax cut bill, and we should evaluate the bill on that basis. 
   Let's talk about singles, for example. The marriage tax penalty relief bill that we are talking about is going to proportionally put more burden on individuals, single taxpayers, on widows who are not heads of households, widowers. They are going to be hit indirectly because of the action that will probably be taken at a later date on this floor. In the main, this is not a 
   marriage tax penalty bill out of the Finance Committee; it is primarily a tax cut bill. 
   That kind of tax cut compared with other priorities may or may not make sense. What about prescription drugs, long-term care, retirement security? I don't think we have addressed those issues enough on this floor; that is, trying to determine what our priorities should be, given the limited number of dollars we have in the budget surplus. 
   Another thing. Viewed as a tax cut, the majority bill is completely arbitrary. There is no particular rhyme or reason to it. If you are married and pay a marriage tax penalty, you get a tax cut. If you are married and pay no marriage tax penalty, you get a tax cut. That is what the Finance Committee bill does, in the main. If you are married and get a tax bonus, you still get a tax cut. That is what the committee bill does. 
   If you are single, you get no tax cut. In fact, the disparity between married and single taxpayers widens to where it was before 1969. 
   Think about this for a moment. If you are married, have no children, you are receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut. If, on the other hand, you are a single mom and you have three kids, you get zero tax cut. Is that what we want to do? 
   So the Finance Committee bill doesn't eliminate the marriage penalty. It simply does not. Sixty-two of the marriage penalties in the code are not addressed by the Finance Committee bill. Only three are. 
   There are many others I have not mentioned which are very big and have a very big effect. 
   In addition, the majority committee bill provides a large tax cut unrelated to the marriage tax penalty. It is a large tax cut which has nothing to do with the marriage tax penalty. 
   I am saying briefly, because my time is about to expire, that there are some major flaws in the majority bill. I have only touched on a couple of them. There are many more which will be brought out later in the debate. 
   I urge my colleagues, people around the country watching this on C-SPAN, other offices, and the press to take a good look at the majority bill because there are some real problems with it. I hope we can straighten them out and fix them very soon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator, is the so-called marriage tax penalty a consequence of getting married or is it a consequence of getting married and the proportion of incomes each spouse earns? I might ask the question differently. How many people in America--if the Senator knows, and he may--get a bonus under our tax laws, not a penalty? What percentage of American taxpayers today receive a bonus as opposed to a penalty?

   Mr. BAUCUS. What we are trying to do is find a solution that solves the problem of the disparity in what each spouse makes, which might then cause the penalty. For example, we all know when you have a married couple and one spouse receives more income than the other--considerably more--the joint tax is going to be less than if they are filing separately. We all know that. That is mathematically a given. The consequence, though, of a married man and woman who earn roughly the same amount is that couple pays more in taxes than they would pay if they were separate. 
   So what we are trying to do is solve the problem--if the Senator would agree with me--and to make sure that when a man and woman get married, we address the problem created when the two people have somewhat similar incomes, which then creates the penalty. So some who are married pay a penalty and some get a bonus. Aren't we only trying to solve the penalty problem for those couples who find themselves in a penalty position?

   Mr. BAUCUS. If I could answer the question, on the other hand, if we want to do something else in addition to solving the marriage tax penalty problem, that is a different debate, and we should try to figure out how best to do that. As it is today, there are 25 million Americans who find themselves in the penalty position when they get married. But there are 21 million Americans who find themselves in a bonus situation when they get married. It is about 50-50. It makes sense, I think, to try to give relief to those in the penalty situation. 
   I am not sure if those who are already in the bonus situation need more relief, as contained in the Finance Committee bill, the majority bill. 
   I was asking the Senator why we are doing that. Why are we doing more than fixing the penalty?

   Mr. BAUCUS. If I might ask the Senator one more question, is it better to try to find some way to pay down the national debt at the same time we are fixing the marriage tax penalty problem? 
   The Senator gave a hypothetical of a man and woman each earning $30,000. They get married and have to pay more taxes. That is not right. I totally agree that is not right. That ought to be fixed. Somebody who pays more income taxes as a consequence of getting married should not be facing that situation, and we should, in the Congress, figure out a way--as various proposals do--so a couple does not have to pay any more income taxes as a consequence of getting married. I agree with the Senator. That is not right.

   Mr. BAUCUS. The question I am asking is this: More than half of the Finance Committee bill does not address the marriage tax penalty problem. More than half goes to married couples who have no marriage penalty problem but who are already in a bonus situation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is important to lay things out as to what this issue is and what it is not. There is a lot of talk that this is a marriage tax penalty. There is even an implication by some that there is something put in the Tax Code to penalize couples because they are married; that is, they have to pay more taxes. Of course that is not true. A little history, I think, is instructive as to why we are here and what perhaps some solutions might be. 
   When the income tax was enacted, the Congress treated individuals as the unit of taxation, whether or not one was married. If somebody made a certain amount of money, he or she paid income taxes. If he or she got married, he or she was subject to the same rates, the same schedule. The individual was treated as the unit. 
   That was the case for a while. But many States in our Nation are community property States. They have different laws which determine to what income a man or woman in married status is entitled. In community property States, the rule is any income earned by a spouse is automatically community property and therefore is equally divisible. As a consequence, in community property States, each, the man and wife, would combine their incomes and file separately. That was upheld by the courts. That created a big discrepancy between community property States and common law States. 
   In common law States, an individual still had to pay the individual rates, whether or not he or she got married, which was just not fair. So Congress in 1948 changed the law to make it fair. What did Congress do? Congress in 1948 said: OK, we are going to double the deductions for married couples as opposed to singles, so when you get married, you do not pay any more taxes than you would pay if you were single. That was the rule of thumb. The brackets for the married were doubled, and the deductions were doubled. 
   That created another inequity. In this area of tax law, when you push down the balloon someplace, it pops up someplace else. The inequity created was the inequity for individual taxpayers because individual taxpayers say: Wait a minute, here I am as an individual taxpayer. I am paying up to 42 percent more in income taxes on the same income that a married couple earns. If the married couple earns $100,000, hypothetically, my taxes as a single individual earning $100,000 are up to 42 percent more than the couple's. That is not right. 
   Congress in 1969 agreed that was not right, so Congress went in the other direction. In 1969, Congress said: We are going to raise it, widen the brackets, adjust the brackets for individuals so they are a little more in line with those for people who are married. 
   The rule of thumb was a tax paid by an individual could not be more than 60 percent more than the taxes paid by a married couple. That was fine for a while. Then over the years we have a lot more couples where both members of the family are earning more income. 
   This is a long way of saying when we make some change in the law here, it is going to cause some inequity someplace else. It is a mathematical truth that we cannot have marriage neutrality and progressive rates and have all married couples with the same total income pay the same taxes. It is a mathematical impossibility to accomplish all three objectives. It cannot be done. So we have to make choices. The choices are whether to tilt a little more in one direction or the other. The bill before the Congress now is a good-faith, honest effort to try to solve that problem. 
   There are different points of view. The bill passed out by the Finance Committee attempts to solve that problem one way. The provision offered by Senator MOYNIHAN, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, had a different approach to solve that problem. Let me very briefly lay it out so people have a sense of what the two different approaches are to solve the marriage tax penalty problem. 
   Recognizing that today, to be honest about it, more married couples receive a bonus when they get married, not a penalty--or, to state it differently: More people, men and women, when they get married today, will receive a bonus; that is, they will pay less taxes as a consequence of getting married than they would individually. 
   It is true that about half of the people who get married end up paying more taxes, and that is called the marriage tax penalty. It is a consequence of the progressive nature of our Tax Code, along with a desire to be fair to widows and widowers and other single taxpayers, and to be fair to married taxpayers, making sure that some married taxpayers, who have the same income as other married taxpayers, do not pay more. It is a very hard thing to do. 
   The majority bill tries to solve it this way: It raises the standard deduction. It raises the 15-percent and 28-percent brackets. It changes the earned-income tax credit for lower income people. It makes no other change. It is pretty complicated. 
   As a consequence, some people who are married and pay a marriage tax penalty will receive relief but not all will. This is a very important point. The majority committee bill addresses only 3 of the 65 provisions in the code which cause the marriage tax penalty. That is standard deduction and the two brackets. That is all. 
   The chart behind me shows the situation. On the left is current law. There are 65 provisions in the Tax Code today which cause a marriage tax penalty. The GOP proposal, which is the column in the middle of the chart, addresses only 3, leaving 62 provisions in the code which cause a marriage tax penalty. 
   What is one of the biggest? Social Security, and it is a big one, too. It costs about $60 billion to fix. The majority  committee bill says: No, we are not going to help you seniors. If two of you get married, you have to pay more taxes. You have a marriage tax penalty; we are not going to help you. The majority committee bill does not deal with seniors at all. 
   There are a lot of senior citizens in our country who are not going to find any relief as a consequence of the majority bill. There are 61 other provisions in the code on which the majority committee bill will not give people relief. 
   The bill offered by Senator MOYNIHAN, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, is very simple. It says to taxpayers: OK, you have a choice. You, as a married couple, can file jointly or you can file separately. That is your choice. You run the calculation, and whatever comes out lower is presumably the one you are going to make. 
   What is the beauty about that? Why is that better? It is better because it is simple. The majority bill further complicates the code, and the code is complicated enough. The majority bill adds more complications by trying to deal with changing the deductions, phase-ins, and so forth. There are a lot more complications. 
   The minority provision is very simple. It says: You choose. It does not add more complications. In addition, it addresses all 65 of the marriage tax penalty provisions in the code today. There are many of them. I mentioned one such as Social Security. That is one the majority bill does not address. 
   Other are like interest deduction of student loans. Many students have loans, and as a consequence of current law, when you get married, sometimes you pay more taxes. The majority committee bill does not do anything about that. The majority committee bill does not address that. It only deals with 3 provisions--the standard deduction and two brackets, 15- and 28-percent brackets. Those three provisions sometimes cause a marriage tax penalty. 
   The minority bill takes care of all the penalty provisions in the code. Look at the chart again. The zero under the Democratic proposal means there are zero marriage tax penalties as a result of the Democratic proposal. The GOP proposal has 62 remaining marriage tax penalties. 
   I am curious as to why they did not address those. I may ask some Members on that side as to why they did not address some of them. A lot of folks are going to wonder, senior citizens are going to wonder, somebody who takes an IRA deduction is going to wonder, someone who takes a Roth IRA deduction is going to wonder: Gee, why don't they take care of marriage tax penalties that affect me? I do not know. Maybe sometime the majority can answer why they do not address those other marriage tax penalties. 
   There are other inequities, but I am not going to get into all of them right now. We will get into them at a later date. 
   It is important to point out that there are two attempts to solve the marriage tax penalty problem: The majority committee bill only deals with three of the provisions in the Tax Code which cause a marriage tax penalty. The minority bill deals with all of them. There is no provision left as a consequence of the minority bill. 
   In addition, the minority bill is much simpler; one only has to choose, whereas in the majority committee bill, my gosh, one cannot choose; they are forced into a situation, and they are not part of the solution. They have to deal with extra complexities. It does not solve the problem. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my good friend, the Senator from Texas, still on the floor. I will ask her a couple of questions. 
   Clearly, we both want to solve the marriage tax penalty. It is my judgment that we are going to pass legislation this week--I hope so. There will be a couple of amendments. It is normal and proper in the Senate for Senators who think they can improve upon a bill to offer amendments. I certainly hope we can dispose of the issue this week. I expect that to happen. I hope so. In doing so, obviously, we want to do what is right. When you do something, you should do your darndest to make sure you do it right the first time so you don't have to correct mistakes later on. 
   I am wondering why it would not make more sense to address all of the marriage tax penalty problems in the code in this bill rather than only a few. As the Senator knows, there are about 65 provisions in the Tax Code, the consequence of which sometimes results in a marriage tax penalty for some married couples--not all but for some. 
   I am not being critical of the provision offered by the majority. But as the Senator knows, in the proposal offered by the majority, they deal with only 3 of those 65 provisions; whereas, the way the minority attempts to solve this, or proposes to solve the marriage tax penalty problem is to allow optional filing; as a consequence, all 65 provisions in the code are dealt with, so that in the minority position all of the marriage inequities are solved--all 65 provisions. 
   I am wondering why--without being critical--it doesn't 
   make more sense for us while we are here, while we are going to pass a bill relieving couples of the marriage tax penalty, to entirely solve the problem, as is the case in the minority bill, rather than only for a few, as is the case in the majority bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. We are on my time, so I will finish up. 
   Briefly, I think it is important to point this out. One of the provisions not dealt with in the majority bill is taxation of Social Security benefits. That is no small item. It would cost about $60 billion over 10 years if it were to be addressed. I remind people that today the majority bill before us is about $248 billion over 10 years. So, in addition, $60 billion is the amount that senior citizens would have to pay as a consequence of the marriage tax penalty, which is not covered by the Finance Committee bill. 
   I might add that, again, the minority bill does solve the Social Security benefits problem, as it does each of the other 62 remaining provisions in the Tax Code which may 
   result in a marriage tax penalty. I hear people say, well, theirs is a better bill. But that doesn't get down to the specifics of what it actually does. I remind Senators that over half of the tax reduction in the bill offered by the Finance Committee goes to people who are already in a bonus situation. It has nothing to do with the marriage tax penalty. 
   I am suggesting that those are dollars that could be perhaps better spent for debt reduction. I think most Americans would like to see the national debt paid off. That makes a lot more sense to me. Or perhaps they would prefer that it go to education, health care, or whatnot. 
   We are here to address the marriage tax penalty. I think we should focus on the marriage tax penalty and, by doing that, I submit that the proposal offered by Senator MOYNIHAN, the minority alternative, focuses only on the marriage tax penalty. It is very simple to understand. Essentially, the taxpayers choose whether to file jointly or separately. I think that sort of empowers the taxpayers to decide for themselves what they want to do. They can be part of the solution where they pay lower taxes and not have to pay any marriage tax penalty at all. Again, $60 billion of Social Security benefits is not fixed by this bill. 
   I want to add this, and I know my time is about to expire, the AMT. One consequence of the committee bill is that there are 5.6 million more taxpayers who are going to have to file under the alternative minimum tax than today--5.6 million new taxpayers, new people who are not filing under the alternative minimum tax, separate and filing today, will not have to under the Finance Committee bill. 
   That is not the case in the minority committee bill. 
   I think we should give relief to those folks so they don't have to go to the AMT situation; or, to say it differently, the Finance Committee bill gives some relief to AMT taxpayers and then takes it back by saying now you new taxpayers have to file the AMT. 
   Why is that result? Why does that happen? It happens because of what I have said for a good part of this day; namely, the Finance Committee bill only deals with 3 of the 65 provisions. Those three are: the standard deduction, the 15-percent and 20-percent brackets. As a consequence, there is this AMT shift. 
   I don't think we want to say to 5.6 million Americans that you do not have to file the AMT today, the alternative minimum tax, and go through all of that and pay that tax, but now you will, as a consequence of the Finance Committee bill. I don't think we want to do that.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from California for her statement. 
   This will come out later when we debate this more. I think it is important to note that the proposal advocated by my good friend from California has a certain deficiency, which is that it does not at all address the marriage tax penalty caused by unearned income. The proposal advocated by my friend from California deals only with the marriage tax penalty caused by earned income; that is, by wages and salaries. There are a lot of senior citizens in our country, as we know. Most of their income is unearned income. It is pension benefits, Social Security income. It is not wages or salary. As a consequence, there is about a $60 billion tax penalty over 10 years for senior citizens that is not addressed in the proposal offered by or mentioned by and advocated by the Senator from California but which is covered by the proposal offered by the Senator from New York, the Democratic proposal. 
   I will address another situation. There are lots of aspects of the marriage tax penalty provision. Again, there is nothing in the code that imposes a penalty on marriage. It is just that because of our combination of progressive rates, a desire to achieve neutrality between married taxpayers and individual taxpayers with the same income, a desire to achieve equality between married couples with the same income but with different distribution in earnings, we end up with this problem. There is no total fix. It is just a matter of trying to figure out what makes the most sense. 
   This chart deals with only one aspect of the so-called marriage tax penalty. That is the example of the marriage tax penalty 
   in the earned-income tax credit, the EITC, a provision in the law which is to help low-income people who otherwise face a significant tax burden, let alone all the other difficulties they are facing in life with low income. This chart shows first a single mother with two children. Let's say her income is $12,000 a year, which is very common. She, today, would receive an earned-income tax credit benefit of $3,888. 
   Let's take a single father with no children. Let's say his income is the same; it is $12,000. Obviously, he receives a zero earned-income tax credit. Let's say the single mom with two children marries the individual with no children. Now they are married with two children. Their total income will  be $24,000, hers $12,000 and his $12,000. But because of the marriage tax penalty, because of the way the Tax Code works, and in particular the EITC provisions which are very complex, as a consequence of the man and the woman getting married, their now joint earned-income tax credit will no longer be the $3,888, which the woman alone with her two children would receive. Rather, now that they are married, the combined EITC benefit would be lower, in the neighborhood of $1,506, a clear penalty for getting married. It is something we want to fix. 
   It has been stated several times that the proposal, the Finance Committee proposal helps low-income people by addressing the marriage tax penalty under the EITC. It does, but not very much. The maximum amount of relief that can be received under the Finance Committee bill in addressing a potential $2,382 penalty is $500. That is the maximum amount of benefit under the marriage tax penalty that is addressed in the Finance Committee bill. 
   Contrast that with the Democratic alternative. Under the Democratic alternative, there would be total relief; that is, a single mom with two children and a single father with no children, when they get married, would receive no penalty. Why is that? Because of the simplicity of the Democratic alternative. The simplicity is, if you are married, you just choose. You file jointly or you file separately. You choose the one which results in lower tax. As a consequence, all of the 65 provisions in the Tax Code which sometimes cause a marriage penalty are addressed. They are all solved. 
   The minority bill solves completely the marriage tax penalty problems facing some Americans. Contrast that with the Finance Committee bill, which does not solve completely the marriage tax penalty problems facing some married taxpayers because the Finance Committee bill deals with only three of the inequities, not all 65. 
   This is just one of the inequities the Finance Committee bill does not address very much. There is kind of a little tack-on provision which addresses it. But as a consequence, the Democratic alternative completely solves the EITC problem. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Lott bill to repeal the gasoline tax that funds our nation's highway program. 
   I do so for two reasons. First, the bill would undermine the landmark 1998 highway bill, which is so important to economic development in Montana and throughout the country. Second, the bill will not reduce the price of gas at the pump. 
   It is, in short, a bad idea. I urge that it be rejected by a strong, bipartisan, vote. 
   By way of background, the gas tax was established for one simple reason: to finance the construction of the national highway system. 
   In 1993, there was a departure. The tax was increased, by 4.3 cents a gallon. And, for the first time, the tax was used not for the highway program, but instead for deficit reduction. 
   I supported the increase, reluctantly, as part of an overall compromise that was a key step toward balancing the budget. 
   Even so, many of us were determined to restore the principle that the gas tax should only be used to fund our highway and related transportation programs. We worked, as we said, to ``put the trust back in the trust fund.'' 
   It was a long, difficult fight. We faced tough opposition, from the administration, the budget committees, and elsewhere. But, in the end, we prevailed. During the Senate's consideration of the 1998 highway bill, we provided that the entire gas tax, including the 4.3 cents, would go into the trust fund and be used exclusively for highway construction and other transportation needs. When an amendment was offered to repeal the 4.3 cent tax, it was defeated. 
   Don't get me wrong. Nobody likes taxes. But the tax goes directly to improve the roads. As these things go, the gas tax has worked well. 
   The Lott amendment would turn back the clock. It would repeal the 4.3 cent tax. 
   Let me explain what this would mean for our nation's highway program. 
   It puts $20 billion worth of the highway trust fund in jeopardy. 
   I'll get right to the point. Most of my colleagues were here for the highway bill debate. You know how difficult it was. You know how hard we fought to make sure that each of our states would get enough funding to support our transportation needs. 
   For my state of Montana, it would mean losing $184 million. 
   That, in turn, will mean delays and cancellations. Roads won't be repaired. Interchanges won't be built. Safety improvements will be left on the drawing board. 
   In Montana, The DOT estimates that upwards of 60 projects would be delayed or canceled. Projects that would increase mobility and save lives. 
   That's not all. If this bill passes, Mr. President, we will be breaking faith. We will be breaking faith with governors. With state transportation agencies. With contractors. And with thousands of hard-working folks who show up every day, in good weather and bad, to build our roads and improve our communities. Who depend on their jobs to support themselves and their families. 
   Senator LOTT and others argue that the bill won't affect the highway program, because any reductions in highway funding would, in effect, be covered by transfers from other programs. 
   In other words, the bill would shift the burden somewhere else. But we all know that there aren't any easy alternatives. There are no easy cuts. So we 
   should not assume that these ``alternative'' cuts will occur. We have to assume that the cuts will come right out of the highway program. And that, again, would be devastating. 
   To what end? the proponents of the Lott bill say that, if we cut the tax, it will reduce the price of gas at the pump. 
   Certainly, there is reason to be concerned about the price of gas at the pump. I represent Montana. The Big Sky State. We drive long distances. We're sensitive to the price of gas at the pump, which has risen from $1.18 gallon a year ago to $1.59 a gallon now. We need to get the price down, as soon as we can. 
   But there is no reason to believe that a reduction in the federal gas tax will result in lower prices at the pump. After all, this is a market ruled by a cartel. Until we break the stranglehold of that cartel, we'll be limited. We can cut the gas tax. But we can't guarantee that the price at the pump will be reduced by the same amount. Instead, the difference may well offset by price increases, by either the OPEC producers or by the refiners, marketers, and other middlemen. 
   Pulling this all together, the Lott amendment will undermine our highway programs without enhancing our energy independence. 
   There's one final point. 
   For the past few years, Congress has been criticized for putting partisan politics ahead of the public interest. In short, of not getting much done. 
   There have been some notable exceptions. Balancing the budget. Reforming the welfare system. 
   And, yes, reaching a bipartisan compromise on the 1998 highway bill, TEA-21. The bill did not just reauthorize the highway program. It renewed and revitalized the highway program. We passed it overwhelmingly, by a vote of 88-5. It was a great accomplishment. 
   We can confirm that accomplishment today, by rejecting the Lott bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The so-called marriage penalty is not a penalty. It is the result of the code. Nobody in Congress decided we were going to penalize married couples by making changes in the Tax Code so that married couples would pay more than two singles would pay with their respective incomes. 
   It is not a penalty in the sense of anyone ever thought of harming anybody. Rather, this is a consequence of the complexity of the Tax Code. It is a consequence of the mathematical impossibility of trying to do all things for all people. Most Americans want a progressive tax rate so married couples who have the same income, regardless of who earns the income, and how much, are taxed the same; in addition to that, have marriage neutrality so married couples do not have to pay more than singles. 
   It is impossible to do all three. Therefore, the Congress has to make choices and judgments according to what it thinks makes the most sense. 
   A little history would be instructive. When the income tax was first enacted, individuals were treated as a taxable unit, regardless of whether they were married or not. If a person had $50,000 in income, he or she paid taxes on that $50,000. If he or she married and that person had zero income, that individual who earned the income would still be treated as the taxable entity and his spouse would not, regardless how much the spouse earned. That was the rule for quite a few years. 
   The problem arose in community property States when the couples could split the income because whatever the major wage 
   earner earned was community property and therefore could be split. Courts upheld that. 
   A little later, Congress thought if that was the case in community property States, it should be the case all around the country. 
   Congress, in 1948, decided couples could split their incomes; that is, if the man earned $70,000 and his wife earned zero, they combined, and they each paid on $35,000. That was the law in 1948. That helped married couples. The trouble was, it hurt singles. In 1969, the disparity was so great, in some cases a single taxpayer could be paying 42 percent more in income taxes than a couple would pay with the same income. 
   Congress thought that was not right. They came up with different rates--one set of rates for singles and another set of rates for married couples--and set the proportion of about 60 percent so that individuals would not have to pay up to twice as much as what they otherwise would pay. That has been the law ever since, although we have made some changes. In 1981, there was a deduction for the lower earner of a couple, to try to address the marriage penalty; that was changed, and another inequity came with the tax bill passed in 1993. 
   We are trying to figure out today a solution to be fair to most people. There has been a big demographic shift in our country since 1969. There are a lot more couples who both earn income, many more now than was the case in 1969. 
   It is important to note that although there is a marriage penalty, there is also a marriage bonus. More married couples receive a bonus when they get married than receive a penalty. It is pretty close. About 51 percent of Americans, because they are married, receive a bonus. Say the husband earns quite a bit more than his spouse, or vice versa; when they get married, they get a bonus. The penalty occurs when both incomes are about the same. Again, more Americans receive a bonus today--not a penalty--as a consequence of getting married. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, $29 billion was incurred by married couples as a penalty and $33 billion was received by married couples as a bonus. That problem has emerged because of the shifting demographic characteristics of our country, with both man and wife now having earned income at equal levels. The more equal the earnings of the spouses, the more likely a marriage penalty will occur. 
   The proportion of working-age married couples with two earners grew from 48 percent in 1969 to 72 percent in  1995. Also, we have seen a rise in the quality of income of married couples. In 1969, only 17 percent of the households of married couples had both spouses contributing at least one-third to the income of the household, but by 1995 that number increased to 34 percent. In the same period, the percentage of households where one or neither spouse has earnings decreased from 52 percent to 28 percent. 
   Without these shifts, more married couples would receive marriage bonuses with few marriage penalties. The unintended problem which has emerged is that half of married couples incur this so-called penalty. The question is, what do we do? The Finance Committee bill reported out by the majority of the committee is a good-faith effort to try to address the problem. 
   It is only fair to point out, there are significant, in my judgment, flaws with the bill that came out of committee. As a consequence, the Democrats will have an alternative which we think addresses a lot of the flaws. 
   What are the flaws? First, one of the big flaws is it is very complex. It adds additional complexity to the code. We all know the code is complex enough as it is. This adds even more complexity. The standard deduction for married couples is double; the brackets are the 15-percent bracket, the 28-percent bracket, double for marrieds. That is a change in the code. The earned-income tax credit ``phased ins'' and ``phased outs'' are changed from current law. AMT personal credits are exempted in certain areas but not in others. It adds considerable new complexity to the code. I am not saying it is fatal to the proposal reported out by the Finance Committee, but it is a fact it adds additional complexities compared with current law. 
   Second, I think it is important to point out there are real problems with the amount and size of the proposal. 
   It is fiscally irresponsible. It is going to cost a lot of money at a time when I think most Americans want to pay down the national debt. 
   When I talk to people around my State of Montana, and I talk to Senators from around the country, they tell me when they talk to their people at home they pose the choice: Do you want to use the surplus that we have, wonderfully, now, in the United States of America to pay down the debt or do you want to use the surplus to lower taxes? I will not say dramatically, but I will say overwhelmingly it is my experience, and I think it is the experience of most Members of the House and Senate when they ask that question, the answer is: Pay down the debt. Americans today would rather pay down the debt. 
   Why? Because they are innately smart; they have a sense of things. We all trust the good faith and good common sense of the American people. There is a conservative element that says: Here we are in times of great national prosperity. We have big budget surpluses. It probably makes sense to start paying down that $7 trillion national debt. We may not have this opportunity again. We would like to think we will, and we hope we will, but we do not know we will. So first I think people want to pay down the debt. 
   The proposal now on the floor is quite large. In fact, the costs for more than half the benefits of this bill go to married taxpayers who are already in a bonus situation. 
   I will state that a different way. More than half of the costs of this bill do not address the marriage penalty problem at all because the lower tax is given to married couples who are already at a bonus situation. They get the bonus because they are married. This bill says: You already have a bonus. We are not going to give you more. 
   The point, I thought, was to address the penalty situation; to try to correct the problem where people, when they get married, pay more taxes as a couple than they would pay individually. That is the problem we are trying to address. The Finance Committee bill addresses a part of that, but more than half of the cost of that Finance Committee bill does not. It does something else. Even the other portion, which purports to address the marriage penalty, does not totally. There are lots of areas in the code where the marriage penalty would still exist. Where are they? In about 62 parts of the code. 
   There are 65 provisions in our income Tax Code which today create the so-called inequities causing bonuses for families--65. The majority bill, Finance Committee bill, addresses only three. There are 62 other provisions in the code which cause a marriage penalty which are not addressed by the Finance Committee bill. 
   What are they? They are things such as the child tax credit, Social Security benefits, savings bonds for education, IRA deductions, student loan interest deductions, and 56 others. The adoption expense credit, for example--there are couples who want to adopt kids. They get married and because of where they might be in the brackets, the progressive rates, they may find themselves paying a penalty because they are married as a consequence of the adoption expenses credit--or perhaps some of the others. So it is a fiscally irresponsible bill. More than half does not address the problem. Rather, it is given to people who already have a bonus--not a penalty but a bonus. The remaining part is skewed. A good part of it does go to address the problem, but in 62 cases inequities, disparities, 
   and penalties still exist. 
   In addition, about 5 million additional taxpayers will become subject to the alternative income tax as a consequence of the majority bill. I do not think we want that. We have all heard the problems created by the alternative minimum tax, the AMT. It is getting to be more and more of a problem as Americans earn a little more income and therefore they are more likely to be subject to that, the alternative minimum tax, which hits a lot of taxpayers pretty hard. As a consequence of the majority committee bill, about a million American taxpayers will now become subject to the alternative minimum tax. 
   So what is a better approach? Speaking generally, we think a better approach is to do something very simple. It has the elegance of simplicity--people can understand it--and it is more fair. What is it? Essentially, we say to a married couple: You have your choice. File jointly or file separately. It is your choice. You just do whatever you want to do. Presumably, you will pick the choice that results in a lower income tax for you. 
   What could be simpler? It is simple to the people of America to explain it to them so they can understand it. It does not add additional complexities that are in the majority bill, but rather it is something very simple. You say to a couple: We don't care what your total income is, we don't care how it is distributed, whether the wife makes 80 percent and the husband 20 percent--it makes no difference. You can have your choice. You file jointly or file separately. Obviously, you file the return that results in the lower income tax. 
   I might add, this already is the case in many States around the country. There are about 10 States today which have just that, to attempt to address the marriage penalty in just that way. That is optional filing. It is optional to file jointly or you have the option to file separately in the States of Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, my State of Montana, Tennessee, and Virginia. You see, the mix of States is varied. There are high-income States and some low-income States--that is per capita income. It is geographically dispersed. But 10 States decided, for the sake of simplicity, or whatever the reason, that was what they wanted to do, and we have heard no complaints. It is an approach that works. 
   The second benefit of the Democratic alternative is this: It addresses all of the marriage penalties--not some of them, all of them. How? By addressing all of the 65 provisions in the Tax Code today which result in marriage bonus/penalty inequity. All of them. You say: How do you do that without additional complexity? It is very simple--because of the effect of optional filing. You just file optionally, individually, calculate your AMT, calculate your child adoption expense, whatever it is, or jointly. And you just choose. That way we address all of them. 
   I might say, the Democratic alternative is also fiscally responsible. Why do I say that? Because we are focused only on the penalty part. As I mentioned earlier, the majority bill, the Finance Committee bill, gives more than half the benefits to people who already have a bonus, who do not need  the help. They already have a bonus. In effect, more than half this bill is a general tax cut bill. That is fine. But then we should call it what it is, a general tax cut bill more than it is a marriage tax penalty reduction bill. It is a general tax cut. If that is the case, then we should have a debate on the code and what is the best way to lower taxes, to deal with taxes for all Americans. It is truth in labeling. It is what we purport to be doing, and that is focusing only on the marriage tax penalty. 
   I might also say the minority bill, the Democratic alternative, does not exacerbate the singles penalty, whereas the majority bill does. Don't forget, we have widows, widowers, single people who need tax help, too. The majority bill in particular--but in all fairness, the minority bill, too--does not address singles, widows, and widowers. It basically deals with married people. Think for a moment; if you are married with no kids and you are receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut in the majority bill. On the other hand, if you are a single mom and you have three kids, you get no tax cut. Let me state that again. If you are married and have no kids, you are already receiving the so-called marriage bonus, you get a tax cut under the majority bill. On the other hand, under the majority bill, if you are a single mom and you have three kids, there is no tax cut. I do not think that is fair. I do not think that is fair at all. 
   That is representative of the inequity of the bill coming out of the Finance Committee. It is not a marriage tax penalty bill; it is a tax cut. If they want a tax cut, then we should have that debate on what the distribution should be, what we should do with the brackets, what incentives do we want to create? What disincentives do we want to address? 
   The Tax Code is pretty big. There are lots of provisions of the Tax Code that affect people on the corporate side and the income side. If we want to cut taxes, let's see how we want to focus that, how to manage it, and how to tailor it. Let's call this what it really is. 
   We have other priorities we have to address. The majority bill costs about $248 billion over 10 years. The minority bill is $151 billion over 10 years. The projected on-budget surplus for the next 10 years is close to $900 billion. It is $893 billion. 
   I will list some of the tax legislation that is pending: This one is $248 billion; the Patients' Bill of Rights will cost about $70 billion; the minimum wage bill in the House is about $122 billion; educational savings is about $22 billion; debt service costs about $100 billion. That means the total of the pending tax legislation is about $566 billion, and what remains is for debt reduction--not very much--and for Social Security and Medicare reform, which is probably not going to be enacted this year. 
   What about prescription drug benefits? Where does that fit in? What about debt reduction and prescription drugs? There is not very much left. 
   When we address the marriage tax penalty, I submit we focus on the problem, and the problem is the marriage tax penalty. The problem is not the marriage bonus; it is the marriage tax penalty. If we focus on the problem, we will solve the problem in a more fiscally responsible way. That is clear. 
   Second, let's make sure the benefits go to those who are facing the problem. 
   I know as this debate unfolds, some of these points will become more clear, but I urge Senators to think before they leap because this is a fairly complex problem. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. I believe neither side has any speakers. I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will make a few points about the budget resolution. 
   First of all, I am quite concerned that the budget fails to set the right priorities. At least when we listen to the American people as to what their priorities are, this budget resolution before us does not fit, does not manage. 
   Once again, this budget resolution emphasizes massive tax cuts at the expense of most everything else. I don't think that is where most Americans are. It might not be readily apparent that this budget resolution emphasizes massive tax cuts. For example, last year's budget provided for a tax cut of $792 billion. This year's provides for a tax cut of only $150 billion. So at first glance, one might say the tax cut this year is a lot less than one-fifth of the one proposed last year and the one that was rejected last year. But that is only at first glance. One has to compare not apples with oranges but apples with apples. 
   Last year's budget was based on 10-year projections; this year's is based on 5-year projections. So if you compare apples with apples, by looking at the 5-year projections, you see that last  year's budget resolution would have cut taxes by $156 billion, almost precisely the same as this year's budget resolution. In other words, it is the same big tax cut, when extended out 10 years as opposed to five. In fact, 98 percent of the projected on-budget surpluses in this budget resolution would be used for tax cuts. But the authors of the resolution fiddled with the accounting periods to make it look a little bit smaller. 
   I don't buy it. I think that is wrong. We should assume that a tax cut that has virtually the same effect over 5 years also would have virtually the same effect over 10 years. Therefore, it is the same old, excessive, unpopular, proposal in a new flashy suit, the one the American people rejected last year. Once they know what is in this budget resolution, I am sure they will have the same feeling; that is, not be in favor of it. It is the wrong priority. In other words, this is a tax cut of about $800 billion over 10 years which will make impossible other popular American priorities. 
   Don't get me wrong. I believe there is room for a reasonable tax cut. I think most Americans think there is room for a reasonable tax cut. But it should be targeted and it should be one that provides relief to working families, people who really need the help. The budget resolution must leave room for other national priorities. 
   In particular, we must take this wonderful opportunity we have to reduce the national debt. I don't know how many times we are going to have this opportunity again. We have it today with a very prosperous economy and with large projected budget surpluses. We should take advantage of this opportunity that we have during this year, and the next couple of years, to dramatically reduce our approximately $7 trillion national debt. That should be a higher priority. It is not a high priority in this budget resolution. 
   The budget resolution should also clearly provide for full prescription drug coverage, as the Robb amendment would do. Prescription drugs are more effective than ever before in maintaining health. They are also much more expensive, leaving many seniors with a choice of either buying groceries or paying for prescriptions. 
   I have seen it, Mr. President. I have worked at a drugstore, and I have seen seniors faced with this choice. It is a very unhappy sight. Our elderly need help now. We have heard comments from Senators who say, shouldn't prescription drug coverage be folded into general Medicare reform? Ideally, it should be, but we have to do the best we can with what we have. I say it is important because seniors need help now. We can't wait for an abstraction of help in the future. We need it now. Clearly, we should enact prescription drug benefits this year. 
   While seniors make up 12 percent of our Nation's population, they account for only about 30 percent of all prescription drug spending. Twelve percent of our population are seniors, but they account for 30 percent of all drug spending. And while about a third of seniors lack drug coverage overall, that number increases to nearly 50 percent in rural areas. Thirty percent of Americans do not have coverage for prescription drugs, overall, in America. In rural America, it is closer to 50 percent. 
   In Montana, there is very little employer-provided coverage. Medigap--the program which is insurance coverage to pay for the difference between Medicare and the cost--coverage is much too expensive in America, particularly in Montana, and there is no Medicare managed care in Montana. That is right. Until January of this year, my State of Montana had only one Medicare HMO, providing quality care and drug coverage to about 2,600 seniors in Billings, MT. But now that plan has pulled out, leaving those seniors without a drug benefit. So we have no managed care Medicare program in Montana because it is too expensive. We don't have the population to provide it. Our seniors are being left out in the cold. In my mind, providing seniors with a prescription drug benefit is a top priority, and it should be part of this budget resolution. 
   I also want to make a point about the so-called marriage penalty. I support the Hutchison amendment. I agree that, as that amendment says, we should pass legislation which begins to reduce the marriage penalty. But I would like to add a word of caution. 
   Listening to some of the debate here, it almost sounds as if the majority is for marriage and that anyone who questions their proposal is against marriage. Nothing could be further from the truth. Marriage is a great institution; I am all for it. It is one of the most wonderful institutions devised by the human race. But the proposal before us and the challenge before us is not quite as simple as some might like it to be. After all, the so-called marriage penalty is not something that was intentionally cooked up to penalize married people and reward sinners. Rather, it is an unintended offshoot of some very difficult, complex decisions that have to be made about our tax system, such as how to tax individuals compared with married couples, which is not an easy question to answer, and how to tax married couples who have a different distribution of income between spouses. Sometimes that is difficult to do. 
   We have wrestled with this problem since virtually the inception of the Tax Code. The current system, which sets the ``break points''--that is, 15 percent, 21 percent, 28 percent--and the various brackets for individuals at about 60 percent of those for couples filing joint returns, was established in 1969 in the tax reform bill signed by President Nixon. So the basic concept we have was enacted in 1969, again, and signed in 
   by President Nixon. 
   It was set in response to a very legitimate concern at that time. That concern was that previous rates were unfair to individuals. So the current system, where we have to correct the mistake that was biased against individuals, now is the one we are dealing with to make sure marrieds are treated fairly as well. 
   There is no easy, pat solution to this problem that doesn't create additional problems. For example, it is mathematically impossible to have a neutral marriage tax--or it is neutral to all married couples if at the same time we want a progressive tax system--and we do--and if at the same time we want all married couples who have the same total married income to be taxed equally, as we do. It is mathematically impossible to accomplish those objectives altogether. I could insert proof of that into the RECORD. That is to say, when you try to adjust the rates, you are going to cause inequities elsewhere, as to what the taxes might be on marrieds versus individuals. It is not an easy thing to do. 
   In fact, the bill reported by the Finance Committee does not eliminate the marriage penalty; it merely reduces the penalty. At the same time, over half of the total relief the bill reported out by the Finance Committee goes to married couples who don't pay any marriage penalty today whatsoever. 
   This bill is somewhat a marriage penalty relief bill, but the Democratic alternative proposed by the Finance Committee, particularly by our ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, is a better approach. Why? First of all, it is less costly and much more targeted. It targets every dollar to the couples who actually are facing a marriage penalty. In other words, it is more targeted, in my judgment, and more responsible.

   Mr. BAUCUS. To sum up, the budget resolution before us does not reflect the priorities of the American people. That is clear. The American people do not want 98 percent of the surplus to be allocated to tax cuts. I daresay the majority of Americans want a large part of it targeted to debt relief, paying off the national debt, something targeted for a marriage penalty, something targeted for prescription drugs, and just to do things right, not make a political statement. 
   I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is at issue is very clear. I hope my colleagues pay attention. The issue is whether this Congress is going to break the trust the American people have in the highway trust fund. That is the issue. 
   Dollars going into the Federal highway trust fund are locked in. There is a trust that those dollars are then distributed back to the States. The revenue in the trust fund goes back to the States. It is a trust, an understanding. That is why we have a highway trust fund. 
   We cannot go down the slippery slope of opening up the trust fund and replenishing it with general revenue or using general revenue to pay for highway allocations because once we start down that slippery slope, we will then have broken the trust. We will have sprung a leak, which will grow into perhaps a creek or a river, and will drain the highway trust fund, as the trust is broken. It is that simple. 
   I very much thank the Senator from West Virginia for drawing this to the Senate's attention. Not only is it the resolution before us, but it is also any potential revenue matters that might come up in this body. The essential point is 
   the linkage. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to continue the trust this Congress made with the American people when it passed the last highway bill, TEA-21. That bill was heralded as a landmark piece of legislation, overwhelmingly passed by both bodies. We all touted it, not only because of the revenues and dedication to the infrastructure so desperately needed but also because of the trust; that is, the assurance that the gasoline tax and the diesel fuel tax people pay at the pump will come back to the States; that it will not be tampered with by the Congress; it will not be changed by the Congress. That is something on which the people could count, of which they could be assured. It is something that is certain, something they can trust. 
   I very much hope we resist the temptation, we resist the siren song for a short-term political change, to jigger around with the 4.3 cents, repealing it and adding the difference to the surplus or revenue. It is an exercise that is not only futile; it is an exercise that is a misrepresentation of what we did in TEA-21, and it will be an exercise which begins to break the trust. 
   Either we keep the trust or we do not. There is no halfway here. There is no little breaking of the trust. Either we keep it or we do not. I submit the American people want us to keep the trust. They will be very upset if we break it. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a letter in the RECORD from various organizations--the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, International City/County Management Association, all in favor of the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Roth amendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate that we should maintain the longstanding ban on oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   We have heard a lot of concern lately about the cost of gas at the pump. 
   I share that concern. I represent Montana. The Big Sky State. Vast open spaces. We often drive long distances just to get to the grocery store. 
   Prices at the pump in Billings have gone from $1.18 in April of 1999 to $1.59 today. We need to get the price down. The administration has made some progress, with the OPEC countries. We may need to do more. For example, we may need to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But we should not respond to high gas prices by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That would be shortsighted, ineffective, and environmentally harmful. 
   Proponents of oil drilling make three main arguments. They imply it will lower the price at the pump. They argue that it will enhance our energy security. And they argue that it won't really pose a significant environmental risk to the refuge. 
   I disagree. Let me take the arguments in turn. 
   First, the cost at the pump. Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will have absolutely no impact on gas prices, now or in the foreseeable future. Think about it. Assume that we pass a law authorizing drilling. Assume the President signs it. First, companies will need to conduct exploration to determine where to drill. Next they will have to build the infrastructure, the roads, drill pads, drill rigs, pipelines, gravel pits, waste pits, and living and working quarters. This could include hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, production facilities, increased traffic at loading ports, and housing and services for thousands of people. 
   This work will take years and years. Senator MURKOWSKI himself said, in 1998, that ``a future decision on ANWR is one which will take about 10 years to produce any results in the way of any increased production contribution to our current flow of domestic oil.'' 
   Ten years, before we see any impact on the price at the pump. 
   Let me turn to the longer term issue. Energy security. Let's look at what the potential oil of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge means in the big picture. At best, the economically recoverable oil would represent 2 percent of our daily needs. As a result, oil drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge has little, if anything, to do with long-term energy security. 
   Another point. It does not make good strategic sense to use our reserves, which account for only 12 percent of the crude oil available in the world, while we have access to other sources. After all, once our reserves are used up, we will be totally at the mercy of OPEC. 
   Instead of continuing our unhealthy dependence on OPEC, we should develop a comprehensive energy strategy. We should improve energy efficiency. We should diversify our energy sources. 
   What are we doing here in Congress? Virtually nothing. 
   We continue to prevent an increase in corporate average fuel economy. We routinely underfund the development of solar and renewable energy. And we fail to seriously consider tax legislation that rewards efficiency and increases our energy security. 
   In the absence of a comprehensive national energy strategy, drilling the refuge is just a band-aid. A quick fix. It's no substitute for a real, comprehensive, strategy. 
   Putting this all together, drilling in the Arctic Refuge will not reduce prices at the pump anytime soon, if at all. And it will not significantly enhance our energy security. 
   Now consider the environmental impact. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is truly unique. It is the only refuge of its type in the world. I've been there. It has been referred to, for good reason, as ``America's Serengeti.'' It's the nation's largest and most northerly wildlife refuge. It includes a full range of arctic and subarctic habitats. Vast herds of caribou migrate to the refuge, bearing their young on the coastal plain. Muskox use the area year-round. The refuge is the most important polar bear land denning area in Alaska. One hundred eighty bird species migrate there, from throughout the hemisphere. 
   Eighteen major rivers contain 36 species of fish. 
   Let's look at what development might do. What happens when the construction of, say, a pipeline and road forces wildlife away? Take the caribou hers. Female caribou seek out the best foraging areas as calving areas. These areas change each year. If, in any given year, the best foraging and calving area is a site for development, the caribou won't use it and fewer calves will survive. Development can also force females into areas where there are more predators, or block them from climbing onto ridge tops to avoid swarms of insects. Again, fewer calves will survive. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service has concluded that the cumulative impacts of these effects could significantly reduce the size of the caribou hers. The Service has expressed similar concerns about muskoxen. 
   What about disturbances from road building? There is not enough water to build only ice roads. You'd have to build gravel roads, even for exploration. Gravel roads will alter the natural flow of water during spring breakup, will melt permafrost, and will otherwise damage the environment. Taken together, this could harm the habitat for more than 100 species of birds. This, in turn, will have effects way beyond the refuge itself. All of these birds are migratory. They nest and rear their young in the Refuge in the summer, then migrate throughout the entire hemisphere, including virtually every state. 
   Now, the proponents of drilling say that the environmental impacts have been exaggerated. They say that the ``footprint'' of development is no larger than Dulles Airport. In fact, the development will not be concentrated in a small area. 
   This map, based on projections by the Fish and Wildlife Service, shows potential pipelines, drilling pads, roads, and other facilities. As you can see, the roads and pipelines stretch across the entire coastal plain, bisecting migration paths and stream channels. What's more, recent reports by the U.S. Geological Service show that the oil reserves in the Refuge are smaller and more widely dispersed than previously thought. As a result, oil development will require more, and more widely dispersed, roads, pipelines, and other infrastructure. Finally, accidents. 
   If the Exxon Valdez taught us anything, it is that humans working in a cold, harsh environment can make mistakes, and that the environmental costs in a fragile ecosystem can be extraordinarily high. Our experience elsewhere on the North Slope confirms this. There has been a general increase in the number of spills. At least two well-blowouts have occurred. At least 76 areas have been contaminated by oil development from the Prudhoe Field. Things usually don't go as smoothly as we plan. 
   That brings me to my final point. It may be that, someday, the need will be so great, and the technology so sophisticated, that we decide that the benefits of exploration and development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are worth it. But we should only make that decision after careful deliberation,  after exhausting all reasonable alternatives, and after assuring that this fragile ecosystem will, in fact, be protected. Because there's no margin for error. If we make a mistake, and allow development that destroys the unique character of this special place, the mistake will be permanent and, perhaps, unforgivable. 
   Mr. President, pulling all of this together, the benefits of drilling simply are not worth it. They are not worth the environmental risks. 
   Therefore, I urge Members to vote to maintain the longstanding ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, by voting for the Roth amendment.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a concern I have about the way we run our trade policy. 
   Over a quarter century ago, Congress passed the Trade Act of 1974. It was a monumental piece of legislation which laid the foundation for America's current trade policy operations. One of its features was a formal system of non-partisan advisory committees. These committees were designed to give the Executive Branch advice from the private sector on trade agreements. 
   The Trade Act created two tiers of advisory committees. At the top is the Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN), composed of 45 people serving for a 2-year term. The members are officers of corporations, trade associations and labor unions. A parallel committee known as TEPAC provides advice on trade and the environment. The next tier contains the Industry Sector Advisory Committees and the Industry Functional Advisory Committees, known as ISAC's and IFAC's. The Trade Act gives the Executive Branch substantial leeway in creating them, chartering them, and choosing their members. Today there are more than two dozen ISAC's and IFAC's. 
   Mr. President, the Clinton Administration announced last month that it was taking a hard look at the advisory committee process. I support that. In the past year, we've witnessed some unwelcome developments in the advisory committee system that call into question whether its operating in the way Congress intended. 
   In May 1999, the head of a prominent environmental group resigned from the TEPAC. He resigned after his committee was asked to comment on regulations only after, rather than before, they were proposed by the State Department. 
   In November 1999, the U.S. District Court in Seattle ruled in favor of environmentalists who were seeking representation on two of the ISAC's for paper and wood products. They believed that the trade issues under discussion could have environmental consequences, and they wanted the ISAC's to consider those consequences when providing advice to the government. The Court agreed, and the Commerce Department took steps to comply. 
   For reasons I don't understand, the Justice Department appealed the decision after the Commerce Department had taken these steps. I have already said that I will introduce legislation mandating environmental participation if the District Court decision is overturned. 
   In January 2000, all three labor representatives resigned from the ACTPN, the top-tier committee. Their complaint was that they had no say in shaping the discussion agenda. So now nobody speaks on behalf of American workers on the ACTPN. 
   Clearly, Mr. President, this process isn't working the way Congress intended. It is time for a fresh look. Let me focus on what I believe are the two main issues we should consider: trade agreement compliance and open participation. 
   In the 1974 Trade Act, Congress gave the advisory committees two main tasks. The first task was to give advice on upcoming and ongoing trade negotiations. The advice they give helps set negotiating objectives and bargaining positions. The second task related to existing trade agreement. The ACTPN, the ISAC's and the IFAC's were to give advice and information on compliance with these existing trade agreements. 
   We need more work on the second task. 
   Over the past 20 years, the United States has entered into more than 400 trade agreements. Last month the GAO issued a report on how well we monitor and enforce them. The answer: not very well. 
   The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has just released an analysis of our bilateral trade agreements there. They examined over 50 separate agreements, testing them for effective implementation. Of the ones given a numerical grade, over half flunked the implementation test. That's miserable. 
   What's the problem? The problem is two-fold. First, everyone wants to negotiate agreements, but nobody wants to implement them. That leads to the second problem: too few monitors. 
   With respect to the first problem, Mr. President, it is worth remembering that trade policy is carried out by human beings. Like people everywhere, they find that negotiating deals is exciting. Negotiating is high-profile work. What about implementation? Implementing deals is not nearly as exciting as negotiating them. Everyone signs up to negotiate. No one signs up to implement. 
   With respect to the second problem, the GAO cited a widespread lack of personnel to monitor and enforce trade agreements. They pointed to staffing gaps at in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department and other agencies. I don't doubt it. President Clinton and Vice President GORE have worked hard and successfully to slim down the federal bureaucracy. So there aren't many extra hands. 
   I don't think this problem can be solved by hiring more people. In fact, given the number and complexity of modern trade agreements, I doubt that we even could hire enough government workers to do the job right. We've moved far beyond the old-style trade pacts that just covered tariffs, where it is easy to see whether everybody's charging the right rate. Nowadays these agreements cover highly specialized non-tariff issues. We have agreements on technical standards for high-tech electronic products. Agreements covering regulatory procedures, such as approving new drugs. Understanding these agreements takes very specific expertise. 
   Even though these trade agreements differ widely in scope and in content, they have one feature in common. Their aim is opening markets for American exports. Who is in the best position to monitor whether or not they achieve that purpose? I submit, Mr. President, that the companies who are supposed to benefit from the agreements are in the best position, along with their trade associations. 
   We have about 1,000 people from the private sector in the advisory committee system. They are all volunteers, working free of charge. They do an excellent job on their first task, advising the government on the negotiating end of trade policy. We should get them working on their second task, monitoring existing trade agreements. And they should do their monitoring out in the open. 
   Every new trade agreement should be assigned to at least one advisory committee. That committee should be responsible for monitoring compliance with the agreement. That committee should report regularly on implementation. It should recommend specific action when it finds examples of non-compliance. Complicated agreements, such as NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, should be parceled out among several committees. 
   Prospective members of trade advisory committees should all meet the following test: do they represent an organization willing and able to help monitor compliance with trade agreements? Only those who answer yes should be put on a committee. 
   Mr. President, let me turn now to the second issue we should examine: public participation. 
   I come from a state with a strong tradition of open government. A Montanan has the right to attend any meeting that a State official holds. No exceptions. The federal government has a tradition of openness too, especially with respect to advisory committees. Congress made openness a statutory requirement with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972. When we passed the Trade Act, we specified openness by requiring that all of these trade advisory committees follow FACA procedures. 
   We left one exception. Meetings could be closed to the public if they covered matters which would seriously compromise U.S. Government trade negotiations. That's a quote from the law. ``Seriously compromise.'' And only with respect to ongoing active negotiations. 
   Today there aren't many active trade negotiations underway. So there is not much to be seriously compromised. Nevertheless, too many advisory committees are still closed to interested observers. That's unacceptable. It's illogical. It's illegal. 
   What are the advisory committees talking about in these meetings? I've heard from people who attend them that almost all of the information discussed is pretty straightforward. Nothing very secret. 
   People who are barred from the meetings don't know that. They begin to suspect that something's going on in those rooms. Maybe somebody is trying to hide something from them. Closing off these meetings just feeds that feeling of mistrust. It's bad government. 
   In the past, the Administration used to close all ISAC and IFAC meetings, until they lost a 1996 court challenge. It was a blanket closure policy. In arguing this case before the court, the Trade Representative's office said that Congress agreed with the blanket closure policy, because we never did anything about it. 
   Let's do something about it. The Constitution gives Congress, not the Executive Branch, authority over international trade. I intend to introduce legislation designed to clear up any confusion about what Congress expects with regard to public participation in ISAC's and IFAC's. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I have found one other feature of advisory committee that we should change. There is a ``consensus'' mentality. Some committees feel that they can only give advice if they reach a consensus. They say that this is why committees can't have members who come at issues in different ways. They'll never get consensus. I see nothing wrong with committees sending forward recommendations along with minority viewpoints. We're a democracy. We do this all the time. 
   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and with the trade agencies of the Executive Branch to get the advisory committee system back on track.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home Health Payment Fairness Act. This bill will prevent a 15% cut to home health care agencies and allow them to continue their critical mission of caring for the chronically ill and the elderly. 
   During the first 15 years of the Medicare program, home health spending accounted for one to two percent of all Part A expenditures. In 1997, home health expenditures reached 14 percent of Part A payments. Congress needed to respond to this growth. And we did so in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   Congress decided to pay home health agencies under a Prospective Payment System. In the meantime, we established an interim payment system, or IPS, that would move agencies away from the old system. 
   Since then, home care agencies have undergone deep budget cuts. Recent CBO projections show that reductions in home health care will be about $69 billion between 1998 and 2002--over four times the original estimate for the same time period. Clearly, home health care agencies have had their budgets cut much more severely than Congress ever intended. 
   Congress has recognized the severity of the cuts and has twice postponed implementing the planned across-the-board 15% cut. Currently, the 15% cut is scheduled to take effect October 1, 2001. 
   So what does the legislation I am introducing do? Simply put, this bill takes the necessary step of not postponing the cut, but eliminating it altogether. The planned cut must be eliminated because we have achieved--in fact, far surpassed--the savings targets set by the Balanced Budget Act. Efficient home health agencies in Montana and across the country have experienced acute financial difficulties and cash flow problems, inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care. 
   Over 2,500 home health agencies nationwide have closed or stopped serving Medicare patients, and, according to a study done by the Lewin Group for the American Hospital Association, these cutbacks have resulted in a 30.5 percent reduction in hospital-based home health services. Moreover, the Health Care Financing Administration estimates that 500,000 fewer home health patient received services in 1998 than in 1997 (the last year for which figures are available), which points to the most central and critical issue. The real losers in this situation are our seniors. Cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care. 
   While patient care across the nation will be impacted if the planned cuts are implemented, rural areas will be especially had hit. If the planned cuts are implemented, rural health care providers will be forced to find ways to further cut costs. Such cost-cutting measures could include closing branches or limiting services. This means that rural patients could face difficulties accessing quality health care. This is especially significant because a high percentage of seniors over the age of 65 live in rural areas; in Montana, that figure is 77%. Thus, any reduction in home health care will directly impact our nation's seniors. 
   Eliminating the 15% cut makes financial sense. If home health care budgets are cut further, costs will increase in other areas. If patients--especially in rural areas--are not receiving the care they need, they will turn to other resources, such as hospital emergency rooms, inpatient cares, and nursing homes. In the long run, this will be more expensive and less efficient. Above all, we must ensure that our nation's elderly and ill receive the care they need. We must not create a situation in which cash-strapped home  health agencies have strong incentives to limit- or even deny-care to the sickest. 
   This bill prevents such a scenario, while respecting Congress' original intention of reducing home health care spending, I think that most of us agree that our seniors and the ill deserve quality home health care. This is a common sense measure that will allow us to realize our original intention of reducing home health care spending, while at the same time protecting the right of our elderly and ill to quality care.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas, and I hope that other Senators pay close attention to her and her very persuasive remarks as to why legislation that will potentially come up in this body to repeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax is a bad idea. 
   The long and short of it, as the Senator said, is that the reason for the high gasoline prices is basically OPEC. OPEC made an announcement which will have the effect of lowering gas prices. I think the 4.3-cent tax is a phantom reduction. There will not be lower prices as a consequence of the  proposal. I think the refineries will keep it and they won't pass it on. There are a whole host of reasons. The main point that is worth considering is that we labored mightily in this body and in the other body a couple years ago to pass a very significant highway program; we called it TEA 21. Was that significant? It said that for the first time all of the Federal gas taxes were going to the highway trust fund, and the highway trust fund would be used only for highways. It was a commitment: People who drive cars and trucks in our country and pay the Federal gas tax or diesel tax will know that tax is going to the highway trust fund and it should stay in the trust fund, with the trust fund dollars to be allocated among the States to build and repair our highways. That was it. It was that simple. 
   So if the bill that may come before this body, which the Senator was addressing, were to be enacted, it would break that trust, break that commitment. It would open up the highway trust fund to potentially any purpose. It would just be the camel's nose under the tent. It would be the first step down the slippery slope of taking trust fund money and using it for other purposes. Why do I say that? Because part of the amendment is to say, OK, let's replenish it with general revenue. We all know ``general revenue'' is a slippery slope around here. We don't know how much general revenue there is going to be; therefore, the solidarity of the dollars going into the trust fund and dollars coming out of the trust fund to pay for highway modernization and new highways has to be kept sacrosanct. I hope the Senate rejects the position to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. It is a bad idea.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will address the pending subject, local-into-local broadcasting. At the end of the last session of Congress, there was some talk that in this session of Congress, this year, we would take up financing to help guarantee local-into-local television coverage in rural areas. Frankly, I wasn't happy with the way we were about to leave the last session of Congress, so I stood up on the floor and tossed a little bit of obstruction around until we got a firmer commitment that by a certain date we would bring up legislation in this body directed toward financing satellites or other entities so that we could provide local-into-local coverage throughout our country. I am very happy now that this bill is before us. As a consequence of the deference of myself and others, we are now here. 
   Very simply, the need for this is extremely important. This chart shows markets that aren't now covered and will be covered under the basic bill to be passed. There aren't very many of them. The red dots depict areas where people can get local-into-local coverage. There are 210 TV markets in our country. You can tell that the red dots don't number 210. In fact, they number something much less than that. I might say that number 210 happens to be right up here--Glasgow, MT. Butte, I think, is 167, and there is Billings. We have a bunch of TV markets in our State, but they are nowhere near where the read dots are. 
   With the passage of last year's bill, 67 markets will have coverage. Only 67 of the 210 markets will eventually get coverage and have local-into-local television coverage. Thirty-five percent of the homes in my State would receive video programming through satellite. Our State flower is the bitterroot, but we have a new State flower now, the satellite dish, 
   because we in Montana have the highest per capita utilization of satellite dishes--more than any other State in the Nation. Montanans per capita have more satellite dishes. It is because Montana is so big. We are a rural State. There are only about 900,000 people in our State, with about 147,000 square miles. You can see why satellite dishes are so important. But because we are so rural and because so many other States are so rural, we are not getting local satellite coverage. It stands to reason because the satellite companies are going to give the coverage to the greatest markets where they will make the most money, as well they should. Companies are there to get the highest rate of return. So they are going to go where they can make the greater returns, and that is going to be the cities. 
   It is only fair that the rest of America also be wired in. That is why I think this bill is so important. It will take a few years to accomplish it, but at least we will get there. 
   What are the reasons for having it? One is to find out what your local team is doing. 
   Here is a chart. This is the University of Montana Grizzlies. Most folks like to know how the home team did. If you don't get local-to-local satellite coverage, it is pretty hard to know. You might be able to find out for New York, Denver, or Florida. But when you are from a smaller community and a smaller town, you only care about the local team. You can't get it now with satellite coverage in my State of Montana and in most places. 
   Maybe it is not the local team. Maybe it is weather conditions. Is a storm coming? What is the weather report? Our State sometimes has blizzards. Sometimes it snows--not very often. Most people think Montana is awfully cold; that we have a lot of snow. Montana is really not very cold. It doesn't snow that much. But every once in a while it snows. We kind of like to know every once in a while when it is going to happen. So we need local notice. Local-to-local is critical throughout our country. 
   The final point I will make is demonstrated by this chart. This shows how well the Rural Utilities Service, a branch of USDA, is already serving America--the telephone cooperatives, and with the power cooperatives around the State. RUS is a loan guarantor. It guarantees loans for wastewater proposals, for electric distribution, transportation, telecommunications, telephone, and distance learning. It guarantees loans to finance operations to build these infrastructures all over the country. 
   The basic point is a very simple one. We have an organization in place. It is serving America well. Why not allow the Rural Utilities Service to, essentially, be the agency that provides the additional loan guarantees for satellites and to give assistance to rural areas? 
   The underlying bill before us sets up a board to do all of this. I submit that another board and another level of bureaucracy does not make sense. We already have an organization that is doing it. Also, this RUS organization has a very good record. In fact, in the last 50 years, the Rural Utilities Service has not had one loan loss in its telecommunications program--not one. That is indicated by the green dots scattered throughout the country. 
   When we finally pass this legislation, remember that we already have an agency doing a good job. 
   I also urge adoption of the pending amendment offered by 
   Senator JOHNSON, which adds the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation as another lender in addition to FDIC-insured banks. I think it is helpful to have that availability. We are more likely to get the financing. 
   I must also say that I hope we include in the underlying legislation a provision which encourages the loan guarantors at the lending institutions to finance new satellite operations not only for local-to-local coverage but also to help in the availability of broader bandwidth and higher-speed Internet connections because we have the opportunity now while we are providing satellite service for local use to also say: OK, maybe we should also give some consideration to wireless, broad bandwidth, and higher-speed access to the Internet because clearly that is the way of the future. Many of the urban parts of our country have broad bandwidths. It is 10 times more expensive, but they have it. 
   In addition, many companies are competing vigorously to provide this service all across the country. They are doing it the good old American way--based on a profit motive. That is great. That is what built America. But a consequence is that rural America often doesn't get near the same coverage as urban America for the same reason, that satellite companies are not providing local-to-local to America; namely, because it doesn't pay nearly as well in rural America as it does in urban America. 
   I am saying that whoever makes the decision, I hope it is not the board. But  if it is the board, give them incentives to provide financing and guarantee financing for satellite companies. It could be perhaps a cable company. It might even be a telephone company that would provide local-to-local cable service. But also they would be in a position to more quickly provide broad bandwidth to the same area. 
   That is the sum and substance of what I hope we do. I think it makes a lot of sense. 
   For those Senators who have some questions about some of these points, I am more than willing to sit down and try to work out some of the details. Some of the details can be worked out in conference as well. But let us not let perfection be the enemy of good. 
   I think these are pretty good ideas. They are not perfect, but they are good. I urge my colleagues to work together to try to incorporate these provisions. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an amendment to which the chairman of committee has graciously stated he agreed. This is a modification of an earlier amendment I provided. This amendment essentially provides that related signals, including high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service warnings, be included in the criteria when the board decides which loans to guarantee in providing for local-into-local service. 
   One of the modifications, frankly, is as follows: Including noncontiguous States. 
   I chuckled a little bit because that is Alaska, which is wonderful. But it also is a technical matter that makes it more likely it is not necessarily constrained by otherwise constraining language. 
   The amendment basically says that, to the maximum extent practicable, the board should give additional consideration to projects which also provide related signals--again, including high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service warnings. 
   The whole point is, we have an opportunity to help provide broad bandwidth Internet service to rural America while we are now passing legislation which gives incentives to provide more local-into-local television coverage to rural America. I believe we should take advantage of that opportunity and give a little boost and a little preference to those applicants who will provide that additional capability. 
   I want to sort of chime in on the point the Senator from Texas was making about the floor looking as if we were not doing our work. There was a group of Montana high school students here about 2 or 3 hours ago. They asked me, Why aren't there more Senators on the floor and why are we not doing business? I explained to them, as the Senator from Texas essentially said, that a lot of work is not done directly in debate but there are negotiations and kind of behind-the-scenes work going on to work things out. I compliment the Senator for his work in helping us accomplish that objective. 
   Before I finish, I also want to pay particular compliments to not only the Senator from Texas but to my colleague from Montana, Senator BURNS. Senator BURNS has been very active in helping provide both local coverage and satellite coverage. I want to particularly note that; in addition, certainly managing a bill of this size, Senator JOHNSON as well as Senator LEAHY from Vermont. 
   There are a lot of people who worked on this. We are making progress. Sometimes it is a little slow. It is not very expeditious, but that is the nature of our democracy. I thank them.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support increased research funding for diabetes, a devastating disease that afflicts 16 million Americans, one-third of whom do not even know that they have it. 
   Diabetes kills one American every three minutes, discriminating neither on the basis of age, race, or belief. It is a lifelong affliction, with severe consequences. This was made painfully clear to me by a meeting I recently had with a boy and his family from Montana. 
   Justin Windham, from Missoula, said to me: ``I want a cure for diabetes because I don't want to have any long term effects like: going blind, kidney problems, or losing my legs. Also I would like to be able to eat whatever my friends eat and not feel left out.'' 
   Justin, and the 16 million other Americans with diabetes, should be able to live their lives without fear of medical complications or the pain of being ostracized. That is why Congress has a responsibility to fund diabetes research and prevention. I urge my colleagues to devote increased resources for research on diabetes, so that our scientists can find a cure.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a young man, Sean-Michael Miles. Slightly over a year ago, his life was taken tragically in an automobile accident in Bozeman, MT, while he was home celebrating the Christmas holidays with his family. Everyone privileged to know Sean was touched by his contagious zest for life. He was among the very best to emerge from our State, from ``The Last Best Place.'' He was a shining star. He is my friend. 
   Sean's father and I grew up as neighbors. We went to school together and remained close friends ever since. I might add, Sean's grandmother, affectionately known as Granny Miles, was one of my baby sitters. I know this family well. Their strength and love for one another is an inspiration to all of us who know them. Sean-Michael's future was as bright as one could imagine. He graduated at the top of his class in Bozeman High School in 1997 and was selected by his classmates to deliver the commencement address. That same address, filled with familiar compassion for our Native American heritage, is still talked about today. Such was its honesty, its power, its celebration of promise. 
   At Princeton University, where Sean was in his second year, he was admired as an exceptional writer, an accomplished artist and musician. Perhaps a classmate put it best: Sean was totally brilliant and completely humble, a cool combination. 
   Following his graduation from Princeton, Sean intended to return to his beloved Montana and commit himself to a career dedicated to writing and the preservation of our last remaining wildlands. 
    Sean enjoyed considerable gifts, and was truly living up to them. 
   Sean wanted to make the world a better place, and believed completely that one person can truly make a difference. There was no cynicism in his life. He befriended the friendless, and remembered the forgotten. Above all, he was making a difference. It is a loss beyond Montana's boundaries as well. Professor John McPhee of Princeton echoed such sentiments:  
   By my lights, Sean-Michael Miles was the best that we can do--bright, responsive, hardworking, clear in expression, clear in thought, and with a personality immediately likable, immediately demanding respect. We will all miss him terribly.  
   Sean enjoyed a way with words. I would like to share a small piece of his brilliant work. 
   After climbing atop a remote buffalo jump, he discovered the ``drive lines'' that the Native tribes of our region used centuries ago to funnel herds of bison over the cliff's edge. Looking out beyond that edge, toward the vast expanse of the Absoorka Beartooth Wilderness, Sean wrote:  
   Whenever I think of the changes sweeping over Montana like a spring storm, a lump forms in my throat. My first breath was drawn from mountain air. 
   Yet I know that this land may pay a price for being beautiful, as change advances, carrying with it the prospect of loss. It is a land I desperately love. It is a part of me. It hurts so much to care so much. Yet as a Westerner, I am invited to breathe it all in deeply each day. 
   Despite change and loss, a drive line containing wisdom offered through memories stretches before me. For now I am satisfied to walk along its path, eyes fixed on what remains a geography of hope.  
   Sean-Michael Miles was proud to live his entire life surrounded by the majestic spine of mountains that he fondly referred to with the Blackfeet phrase, ``the backbone of the world.'' 
   Sean's death casts a dark shadow over the future of those of us who knew and loved him. Yet it is the light he offers that we commemorate today. 
   I have risen today to announce that I will create a fellowship in Sean's name that will focus on the conservation issues that were so dear to him. I am also pleased and honored to announce that the first Congressional Fellow serving in this prestigious position will be Sean's beloved sister Michelle. Her younger sister, Shaleen, once served as Democratic page on the floor of the Senate. So today, Michelle, who is sitting behind me, I welcome you to my staff, and I know that you bring with you your brother's finest qualities. May the legacy of Sean-Michael Miles, who walked with the silent feet of reverence through the wilds, forever serve as a source of inspiration for generations to come.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an important day. Today we are finally bringing to bear over eighteen months of hard work toward reforming the Federal Crop Insurance Program. This is an issue of vital importance to Montana. 
   First, however, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in applauding Senators ROBERTS and KERREY for their hard work in bringing a comprehensive solution to the table as well as Chairman LUGAR for helping us work quickly to pass this important legislation. We can all be proud of a job well done. 
   The bill before you to day, the Risk Management for the Twenty First Century Act, is a fine example of what can be done when we work on a bipartisan basis to solve a difficult problem. I am pleased that Montana producers and crop insurance providers also contributed largely to this effort. 
   Last spring, I held a crop insurance community hearing in Shelby, MT. Ken  Ackerman, director of the Risk Management Agency, flew out for that hearing and got quite an earful. Montana farmers told us they wanted a program they could count on. A risk management tool that would be more efficient, more cost effective, more responsible, and more accountable. A program that encourages farmers to try new and innovative crops. And a reliable system that moves us away from the annual ad hoc disaster band-aids. I would like to extend a personal thank you to Ken Ackerman and his agency for listening to our concerns and helping draft them into this legislation. 
   Today, I am optimistic that we in the Senate are soon to make those goals a reality. The $6 billion legislative package before us today will amend the Federal Crop Insurance program in several specific ways. The measure will: 
   Make crop insurance more affordable and broaden coverage to encourage producers to purchase the highest levels of coverage; 
   Create more realistic production history so that produces won't be penalized for losses over several years; 
   Encourage producers to plant new specialty crops; 
   Require producer input on the federal crop insurance program board of directors to ensure that the program works for the people who are buying the insurance product; and 
   Make it easier for producers to get disaster assistance for crops that have no production history. 
   I would like to highlight one particular section in this bill--that is the provision that at long last addresses the fact that during previous farm programs, Montana specialty crop producers have had little or no safety net. This is important since traditional crop prices have collapsed and farmers have ventured into specialty markets to survive. But because they have little or no production history, they are not eligible for traditional crop insurance coverage. Instead they are subject to the Non-Insured Agriculture Program. 
   Unfortunately, the NAP program does not work. I have been told that in order for a farmer to be indemnified, she must be a ``very lucky person.'' A loss suffered per se does not trigger payments. Instead, at least five other producers in a defined 320,000 acre area must also suffer severe losses in order to trigger NAP coverage. Clearly, unless all the pieces fall together in a perfect puzzle, it is likely that the producer will not be paid. 
   Last year, I offered legislation that will help Montana farmers try new and innovative crops by streamlining the NAP. Among other provisions, our proposal eliminates the area trigger. That way if disaster strikes, the producer will be covered. Plain and simple. Senator LARRY CRAIG joined me in that effort, and I am pleased that our legislation is included in the Senate bill that we are currently considering. 
   Folks at home want to farm. They can not control the weather, but they should be able to invest in a program that helps them manage nature's unpredictable whims. With an improved crop insurance program, Montana farmers will be able to diversify, take risks and move beyond our traditional way of thinking. 
   We have before us the perfect opportunity to do what is right for Montana and rest of rural America--pass comprehensive crop insurance reform. I thank everyone who contributed to this effort and look forward to passage in the Senate, a successful conference and President signing the bill into law in the very near future.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R..5, the Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act. I am a cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, S..2074. 
   The earnings test, to remind my colleagues, is a Depression-era holdover which reduces Social Security benefits for working retirees. When Social Security began 65 years ago, its creators hoped older workers would withdraw from the work force and make more room for younger workers. This was back in the 1930s, in the Depression. 
   So they reduced retiree's Social Security benefits according to a formula, which today causes the loss of $1 in benefits for every $3 earned over $17,000 for those between the ages of 65 and 69. 
   While this might have made sense during the Great Depression, which at its peak saw one out of every four Americans without jobs, driving older workers out of the workforce simply does not reflect the needs of today's America. Americans today are retiring sooner, and the number of employed males over the age of 65 has fallen from 47 percent 50 years ago to less than 17 percent today. In addition, we all know the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds is threatened because our society is aging. In 1950, there were 17 people in the workforce for every person drawing Social Security benefits. By 1999, this number had dropped to less than 4 people working for every one person drawing benefits. And under the intermediate projections of the Social Security trustees, this number will drop even further, to less than 2 people working for every one beneficiary by 2075. 
   In today's era of low unemployment, it simply makes no sense to penalize retirees who want to continue working. And as we look at the continued graying of our society throughout the 21st century, it will become even more critical to eliminate disincentives to work for this growing segment of our population. 
   Working seniors are a vital employee pool for America's businesses. We need the experience they bring from a lifetime of learning to help train our younger workers. And many seniors need the income that comes from these jobs to help make ends meet. The earnings test especially hurts senior citizens who face heavy medical bills or other expenses in caring for a spouse or other family members. Yet over 630,000 seniors today are receiving reduced Social Security benefits simply because they want or need to work. And there is no way to know how many more only work part of the year because they don't want to earn more than the $17,000 limit. 
   We should recognize that enacting this legislation is not without its tradeoffs. Those who have their benefits reduced because of the earnings test today receive higher lifetime benefits after they turn 70. For some retirees, this tradeoff could cost them in the long run. But for seniors who are having trouble making ends meet today, the promise of higher benefits after they turn 70 seems hollow indeed. 
   So I am glad that we are finally at least taking this first step toward restructuring the Social Security system to face the realities of our workforce in the 21st century. I am also glad, that even in this highly charged political climate, Democrats and Republicans can still find some issues that we can agree on. 
   I hope we can continue to look for more issues like this as the session continues. Putting aside our political differences for the good of the American people, after all, is what the public wants. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the DCA Perimeter Rule and its impact on the West. This is very important to me because it affects western States, like Montana. 
   I support the recent conference provisions that allow exemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The Conferees should be commended for working to create a process that balances interests of Senators from states inside the perimeter and those of us who are from western states that do not have convenient access to National Airport. 
   Right now passengers from small and medium-sized communities in the West are forced to make double and sometime even triple connections to fly to National Airport, or any other Washington airport. Let me talk for a minute about my home state of Montana. It takes an entire day to get from Washington to Montana or visa versa. In order to fly into Montana you need to fly in to Salt Lake, or Denver, or one of the other western hubs and wait for one of the two or three 60 passenger flights that flies into Montana that day. 
   This is true for small communities throughout the West, especially in the Northwest corner that use hubs like Salt Lake City. 
   The conference report has the potential to improve access throughout the West. I believe it is important that the Department of Transportation ensure that this benefit is not limited to a few large cities which already have a variety of options for flying to Washington. 
   By enforcing this rule we are making access to DC easier for western states. The nation's Capital should be accessible without hassle to the entire country. I do not like the fact that if someone from my home state of Montana wants to come here to talk to their nations representative that they need to spend an entire day traveling, and waiting in airports for a connection. 
   My support for this effort dates back to when this legislation was first introduced. I want to ensure that these limited exemptions benefit the people of the West. I want to make it very clear that the limited number of exemptions should not be awarded to any one airport or airline. I hope, and expect that the Department of Transportation will ensure that the 12 slots granted by the conference are distributed proportionally, so that as many cities in the West, and especially the Northwest can benefit.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to make two sets of comments on Japan today. The first relates to Japanese telecommunications deregulation. The second involves a recently issued report about the lack of compliance by Japan with the trade agreements it has signed with the United States. 
   I am introducing today, along with Senator GRASSLEY, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution designed to encourage the Japanese Government to deregulate and open the Japanese telecommunications sector. Intense negotiations are going on between our government and Japanese authorities, and I hope that the Senate, by speaking out forcefully, will give support to the progressive elements in Japan as they do battle with the eternal forces of protection. 
   The United States has worked tirelessly to promote deregulation and openness in the Japanese telecommunications sector over the past 20 years. These efforts have led to significant changes in the procurement policies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, or NTT, which used to be the government owned, monopoly domestic telecommunications provider, and is still the 800-pound gorilla in the sector. The efforts included agreements on devices for interconnection, cellular phones, and international value added networks. It involved use of U.S. laws like section 301 and section 1377, the MOSS talks, the GATT, the WTO, and the Information Technology Agreement. 
   The United States has probably negotiated more on Japanese telecommunications than we have with any other nation over one specific sector. We have made a lot of progress, going from almost no sales by Americans in this sector in Japan two decades ago to several billion dollars today. 
   But considerable work remains, and the focus now is under the rubric of the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation. Japan, despite a decade of stagnation, is still the world's second largest economy with incredible cutting edge technology. Nevertheless, its pattern of consumption of high tech telecommunications goods and services makes it look more like a second tier economy. While Japan's penetration of cellular phones is among the highest in the world, it falls far behind in many other measures of high tech telecommunications usage. For example, Japan has only 20 million Internet users, compared to 80 million in the United States. Japan hosts two million web sites, while the United States hosts over 30 million. Electronic commerce in Japan is valued at less than one billion dollars, versus at least 30 times as much in the United States. And only 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to the Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools are: 
   The explanation is that Japan has a non-competitive regulatory system in telecommunications that prevents market forces from fully operating. Foreign telecommunications service and equipment providers are limited in their ability to do business in Japan. This means that Japanese consumers are prevented from obtaining the highest quality telecommunications 
   technology at the lowest price. They are not allowed to choose from the incredible array of services and products available around the world. And they pay higher prices than they should. Japanese firms also suffer for the same reasons in their procurement of telecommunications goods and services. They cannot get the best, and they overpay for what they can buy. Many modern services are simply unavailable in Japan. 
   If the Japanese Government wanted to follow a path that would lead to higher economic growth, greater choice and lower prices for its consumers, and increased efficiency for its industry, it would deregulate this sector immediately. 
   The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I am introducing today simply stresses the need for significant regulatory reform in Japan, supports USTR in vigorously pursuing this, and sends the message to Japan that the Senate is strongly behind such an effort. Deregulation serves American and international business. It serves the Japanese economy. It serves the Japanese consumer. It serves Japanese industry. And it serves the regional and global economy which needs a growing Japan. In the long run, everyone would be a winner if Japan let market forces operate. 
   The second issue I want to address today is a report issued earlier this month by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, the ACCJ, on Japan's compliance, or, rather, insufficient compliance, with trade agreements. The study, ``Making Trade Talks Work 2000: An On-the-Ground Analysis of US-Japan Trade Agreements by American Businesses,'' looked at 58 major United States/Japan trade agreements reached between 1980 and 1999. The ACCJ rates 51 of them on a numerical basis, using four measures. Their astounding conclusion was that 53 percent were fully or mostly successful, while 47 percent were rated as partially successful, successful in only one or two ways, or unsuccessful. 
   This rating, performed by American companies and industry associations on the ground in Japan, working every day in the trenches to penetrate the Japanese market, should be a wake-up call to all of us. Despite all the attention spent on opening the Japanese market during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, barely half of the agreements signed actually worked. This is an utterly unacceptable result. I commend this report to my colleagues. Not only is its analysis excellent, but the ACCJ offers a range of recommendations for future action. 
   Compliance by other nations with trade agreements is a serious problem for our country, and it will likely get worse. Many of the easy trade barriers around the world, such as tariffs and quotas, have been significantly reduced or eliminated. Now, we face the tougher trade barriers, such as anti-competitive practices and internal regulations and standards designed to keep out foreign goods and services. These barriers are harder to identify, harder to get agreement on, and it is harder to measure the results. 
   I am very worried about our government's system of monitoring trade agreements and ensuring that our trading partners will comply with their commitments. The GAO has told us that there is not even a place in the government where you can go to get a list of all trade agreements. When the ACCJ did its earlier study in 1997, they spent months just assembling all United States-Japan bilateral trade agreements. If you don't know what agreements exist, how can you enforce them? 
   In its most recent report on this subject, the GAO concluded that the Executive Branch needed a more integrated approach to monitoring and enforcing trade agreements and should pursue a process of comprehensive and sustained strategic planning. GAO also concluded that declining staff levels have limited agencies' monitoring and enforcement activities. Some of the special skills needed to deal with the new complex trade agreements is also lacking. 
   I deeply appreciate the ACCJ's diligence in presenting us with an objective analysis of the Japanese market situation. But, as GAO indicates, this may be just the tip of the iceberg internationally. The problem is pervasive, and I don't see any trends that will make it better. 
   That is why, among other reasons, I recently introduced the China WTO compliance bill to make sure that, once China enters the WTO, we won't have this massive violation of our trade agreements as has happened with Japan. That is why I recently introduced a bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office to provide the Congress with precisely the type of objective information that the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has provided, and to help those of us in the Congress ensure that trade agreements reached are trade agreements implemented. I call on my colleagues to work with me to develop a system that will ensure that American workers,  farmers, and businesses will benefit from the trade agreements that our trade officials so diligently negotiate.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 2 1/2 years ago, when the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) was enacted, few Members of Congress paid much attention to a small section in the BBA that created a new program for hospitals in frontier and rural communities. 
   This program, called the Critical Access Hospital, was buried among hundreds of provisions affecting Medicare. Yet, in many ways, it may well be one of the most lasting achievements of that session of Congress. 
   The Critical Access Hospital idea is based on a very successful demonstration project in Montana. This project, called the Medical Assistance Facility Demonstration Project, was coordinated by the Montana Health Research and Education Foundation (MHREF). This foundation is affiliated with MHA, an Association of Montana Health Care Providers, formerly the Montana Hospital Association. 
   As is usually the case, many people can claim at least some of the credit for the huge success of the MAF demonstration project. But the person who should claim the lion's share of the credit has never chosen to do so. It is that person--Keith McCarty--who I would like to recognize today. 
   Keith McCarty joined MHREF in 1989. At that time, even the concept of an MAF was vague. Several years earlier, a citizens' task force had dreamed up the idea of a limited service hospital to provide access to primary hospital and health care services in rural and frontier communities. Acting on the recommendations of the task force, the Montana Legislature had created a special licensure category for these hospitals. 
   MHA, the state department of health and others seized the opportunity created by the Legislature and, working with the regional office of the Department of Health and Human Services, developed a demonstration project aimed at determining whether MAFs would actually work. Keith was hired with the unenviable task of transforming this amorphous concept into reality, a job few gave him much hope of performing successfully. 
   Keith brought a broad range of skills to his job. Trained as a psychologist, from 1968 to 1975, he worked with the developmentally disabled in a variety of positions, including serving as the Superintendent of the Boulder, Montana School and Hospital, the state's school for developmentally disabled children. Beginning in 1975, he provided professional contract services for a wide variety of health care and social service organizations. 
   By the time he joined MHREF, Keith was skilled at managing projects, preparing grant applications, coordinating and supervising grant-funded projects, program development and evaluation, research and data analysis, facilitating community decision-making and inter-agency cooperation. All these were skills he would use in developing the MAF demonstration project. 
   The MAF demonstration project brought its share of challenges. Among Keith's toughest challenges was convincing communities that the quality of their health care would not decline if they converted to MAF status. Once beyond that hurdle, Keith worked tirelessly with the state's peer review organization, fiscal intermediary, facility licensure and certification bureau and HHS officials to remove other potential roadblocks. 
   First one facility made the conversion, then another and before long there were more than twice as many as the project thought might convert to MAF status. I pushed for the Medicare waiver in the early 1990s, and the Medical Assistance Facility became a reality. 
   As the demonstration neared completion, Keith worked closely with my staff to draft the Critical Access Hospital legislation that I introduced in 1997 and saw through to final passage as part of the BBA. His insights about how Critical Access Hospitals might function, in practical terms, proved invaluable. And the model embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 closely parallels the experience Montana's MAFs enjoyed. 
   Keith McCarty retired on December 31, 1999. He retired only after ensuring that Montana's MAFs were able to seamlessly transition into the new Critical Access Hospital program. 
   His departure from MHREF marks a fitting transition for the Critical Access Hospital program. Once only a dream in the minds of a few people in the sparsely-populated areas of central Montana, the Critical Access Hospital has already become an institution in many communities across America. 
   Keith is far too modest to take credit for his labors. So, what he won't say, we should. Keith's efforts--and the MAF demonstration project--have been recognized in special awards from the National Rural Health Association and the American Hospital Association. 
   But perhaps the most fitting tribute that can be paid is to note that today, in 15 communities in Montana, routine health care services are provided in Critical Access Hospitals. If there had been no MAF demonstration project, health care services in at least half of these towns would no longer be available. 
   I want to acknowledge and thank Keith McCarty for the service he has provided to so many Montanans.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year I introduced a bill to create a Congressional Trade Office. That bill was designed to provide the Congress with new and additional trade expertise that would be independent, non-partisan, and neutral. Today, I am introducing the same bill with several small changes. 
   The role of Congress in trade policy has expanded in the few short months since I introduced my bill in September. We went through Seattle and the failure to launch a new multilateral trade round. The public is more interested in trade issues than ever before. There is a new urgency to reconcile labor and environmental issues with trade. We are on the cusp of seeing China enter the WTO with permanent Normal Trade Relations with the United States. The General Accounting Office has told us of the deficiencies in the Executive Branch in following trade agreements and monitoring compliance. And, for the first time, trade will be an issue in the Presidential campaign, as well as in Senate and House races. 
   Congress needs to be much better prepared. And that means we need access to more and better information, independently arrived, at from people whose commitment is to the Congress, and only to the Congress. 
   Congress has the Constitutional authority to provide more effective and active oversight of our Nation's trade policy. We must use that authority. Congress should be more active in setting the direction of trade policy. I believe strongly that we must re-assert Congress' constitutionally defined responsibility for international commerce.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce critical legislation in the fight against methamphetamine use in rural America. 
   Methamphetamine, also known as ``meth'' is a powerful and addictive drug. Considered by many youths to be  a casual, soft-core drug with few lasting effects, meth can actually cause more long-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack. 
   I recently invited General Barry McCaffrey, our drug czar, along with Dr. Don Vereen, his deputy, to Montana to focus attention on the problem of meth use. Their visit was well-received by residents of our state, and much-needed. The fact is, there are a good many talented Montanans working on the meth problem, but they have few resources with which to wage the battle. Moreover, their efforts are often fragmented, not coordinated to the extent they could be, particularly among the treatment, prevention, and law enforcement communities. 
   To make their job easier, Montana has petitioned to be considered part of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). Although the Rocky Mountain HIDTA authorities have stated their willingness to include Montana in its organization, they lack the resources to make that happen. 
   The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding to make Montana's admission to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA a reality. Here's why that's necessary. 
   In 1998, the number of juveniles charged with drug-related or violent crimes in the Yellowstone County Youth Court rose by 30 percent. In Lame Deer--the community of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation--kids as young as 8 years old have been seen for meth addiction. Last November in our state, a meth lab blew up in Great Falls, leading to a half dozen arrests. Meth use in Montana has doubled in the past few years. Cases are growing and the states law enforcement can no longer fight the problem. 
   Mr. President, the DEA reported an increase of meth lab seizures in Montana of 900% from 1993 to 1998. And according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, based on methamphetamine admission rates per 100,000 persons, Montana is one of eight states with a ``serious methamphetamine problem.'' 
   The meth problem is particularly severe on Montana's Indian reservations, of which our state has seven. Life is hard there. In some reservation towns, over half of the working age adults are unemployed. Because meth is cheap and relatively easy to make, these lower-income individuals are a natural target for meth peddlers. Without viable employment options, too often these young people turn to drugs. 
   And that's the case throughout Montana, not just on the reservations. In 1998, Montana ranked 47th in the nation in per-capita personal income, 50th in personal income from wages and salaries, and second in the nation for the number of people who work two or more jobs. 
   Since poverty and drug use often go hand in hand, it came as little surprise to me when a recent report showed a dramatic uptick in the incidence of drug abuse in rural America. 
   The report, commissioned by the Drug Enforcement Administration and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, focused primarily on 13- and 14-year-olds. It showed that eighth graders in rural America are 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban counterparts. They are 50 percent more likely to use cocaine, 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana, 29 percent more likely to drink alcohol. Even more shocking, the report showed that rural eighth graders were 104 percent more likely to use amphetamines, including methamphetamine. Let me clarify, Mr. President. That is double the rate of urban eighth graders. 
   The bill I am proposing today would provide Montana the resources to put forth a coordinated effort in the fight against meth in Montana. By admitting Yellowstone, Cascade and Missoula counties to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA, Montana can focus its efforts on the three largest problem areas for meth use. It would increase law enforcement and forensic personnel in Montana; coordinate efforts to exchange information among law enforcement agencies; and engage in a public information campaign to educate the public about the dangers of meth use. 
   Mr. President, the time has come to fight this scourge. Montana is under seige by meth, and we must do all we can to stop it--for the good of our state and those around us.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the passage of S. 1653, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act Amendments, a bipartisan bill that will encourage cooperative approaches to wildlife conservation. 
   By way of background, in 1984, with broad bipartisan support, Congress created the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a nonprofit corporation with the mission of conserving our nation's fish, wildlife, plant, and other natural resources. 
   Over the past 15 years, the Foundation has established a solid track record. It has achieved on-the-ground results. it has also stretched federal dollars and built public-private partnerships essential to conservation efforts. All told, the Foundation has provided more than 3,500 grants to over 940 private local organizations, state and country governments, tribes, federal and interstate agencies, and colleges and universities in all 50 states. 
   By requiring grantees to match Foundation grants with non-federal funds, the $135 million in federal funds invested by the Foundation have been leveraged to deliver more than $440 million to natural resource conservation efforts. Significantly, these funds are used to help build public-private partnerships among individual landowners, government and tribal agencies, conservation organizations, and business. The result is the development of consensus, locally-driven solutions to the challenges involved in protecting and managing fish, wildlife, plants, and other natural resources. 
   In my home state of Montana, where fishing, hunting, and the enjoyment of our natural resources are deeply ingrained into our way of life, the Foundation has made important contributions to conservation efforts. These contributions include supporting environmental education, habitat restoration and protection, resource management, and the development of conservation policy. 
   In 2000, the Foundation will support nine important projects in Montana, for a total $821,700. These projects include restoring arctic grayling within their historic range in the upper Missouri River basin; improving trout passage through the Milltown Dam to assist fluvial westslope cutthroat and bull trout moving upstream to spawn; supporting the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee; supporting a comprehensive K thru 12 environmental education program for 300 Bitterroot Valley students; and partnerships with private landowners to conserve Montana's shortgrass prairie habitat and the bird species it supports. 
   Let me describe one of these efforts in a little more detail. In Northwest Montana, westslope cutthroat and bull trout have declined throughout their historic range over the last 100 years, in part because of barriers that limit their spawning migrations. 
   To address this problem, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, working with the Blackfoot Chapter of Trout Unlimited will capture, tag, and transport mature  westslope cutthroat and bull trout around Milltown Dam near Missoula and release them upstream of the dam so the fish can continue their spawning migration in the upper Clark Fork watershed (including the Blackfork River and its tributaries, and the Rock Creek drainage). Radio transmitters will be implanted in the fish to monitor their spawning sites and success. 
   This is just one example. Over the years, the Foundation has funded 187 projects and delivered a total of almost $13 million to conservation projects in Montana. 
   Mr. President, even with these accomplishments, the need to conserve the nation's natural resources remains. Today, in too many areas of the country, the health and sustainability of fish, wildlife, and plants, and the habitats on which they depend, are threatened. Bitter disputes continue to arise among interests when solutions to difficult natural resource problems are sought. Tight budgets often severely limit the ability of governments and private entities to adequately address conservation challenges. Because of all these factors, the Foundation, which promotes conservation by building partnerships and consensus, is as important today as it was in 1984. 
   The bill we are considering, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act Amendments, will increase the Foundation's ability to carry out its mission. First and foremost, the legislation authorizes federal appropriations through 2004 to support the Foundation's work. The legislation also strengthens the Foundation by increasing the size of its board of directors and allowing board members to be removed for nonperformance. Finally, the bill broadens the Foundation's authority by allowing it to work with all agencies within the Departments of Interior and Commerce. 
   The legislation is nearly identical to legislation the Senate passed last year. 
   Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has provided valuable assistance to this nation's natural resource conservation efforts over the past 15 years. If the legislation we are considering today is enacted, I have no doubt that the Foundation will continue its solid record of accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference report on Federal Aviation Reauthorization. I am pleased that Congressional negotiators have reached an agreement providing needed resources and investment for the federal aviation programs, while maintaining budgetary discipline. 
   The final agreement maintains the FAA on-budget status but insures that the money in the Trust Fund will be spent only on aviation programs. The agreement provides a strong and enforceable guarantee to ensure that FAA appropriations will be no less than the amounts paid annually into the Trust Fund. The final agreement also permits the use of general funds for aviation programs subject to the normal appropriation process. This combination of Trust Fund and general fund revenue will help to ensure that much needed construction and maintenance are carried out as part of our nation's aviation program. 
   Part of the agreement reached by the conferees includes a provision which addresses what I believe is a complicated and growing problem--flight delays and cancellations. 
   The problem is not that delays and cancellations occur. Airlines must maintain a tight schedule and that schedule can be greatly affected by weather or equipment problems. 
   For travelers, it is a mystery whether these delays and cancellations are caused by weather, equipment problems, or economic convenience. Nobody knows. The airlines don't have to tell you. After you finally reach your destination, there's a good chance that you'll never know why you were stranded thousands of miles from home or why you missed that important business meeting. 
   But flights also are canceled or delayed for economic reasons, not just mechanical or weather-related problems. And when these economic delays and cancellations occur, it's usually rural America that gets the short end of the stick. For instance, if there are 40 people in Denver waiting for a flight to Billings, MT and another 120 waiting to go to San Francisco but only one plane is available, the flight to Billings will be canceled. For the Airlines, its simple. It costs less to put 30 people up in a hotel and send them on to Billings the next day than it does to send 120 California-bound people to a hotel. 
   That is wrong. If flights are canceled for economic or other reasons, passengers deserve to know the truth. It will also allow them to shop around for the airline that has the best performance record. When you only have a couple of flights into a town, as is the case with much of rural America, cancellations are not just an inconvenience. There is an economic impact as well. 
   As my home state of Montana, and our neighbors in North and South Dakota, Wyoming and Idaho can attest, what business is going to relocate to an area where flight service is not reliable? 
   Right now, Montana's economy needs work. Our state ranks near the bottom of per-capita individual income. Other measures of economic progress are also pretty low. Reliable air service doesn't guarantee economic growth. But without it, workers and employers alike have a difficult burden to bear. 
   That is why I am pleased that the conference report contains a version of my amendment to require air carriers to more fully disclose the cause of delays. The conference report creates a task force that will modify Airline Service Quality Performance Reports to reflect the reasons for such delays and cancellations, such as snow storms, mechanical difficulties or economic reasons, like the one I just mentioned. This task force will consist of representatives of airline consumers and air carriers. 
   Currently, the ten largest airlines have to report monthly to the Department of Transportation all flights that are more than 15 minutes late to and from the 29 U.S. airports that make up at least 1 percent of the nation's total domestic scheduled-service passenger enplanements. This statistic includes cancellations. My provision will broaden this reporting so that more passengers will have this information. 
   I realize that simply reporting the reason will not stop the practice of delaying flights or canceling them for economic reasons. Airlines are a business. An industry. As such, they must make business decisions that will keep their operation in the black. 
   But, if airlines have to start reporting the reasons for missed connections and disrupted lives, consumers can start making their own choices about which airline to fly. In the end I hope this information will lead to more dependable service around the country, but especially in rural America.

   Mr. BAUCUS. 
   Mr. President, today, I am introducing the China WTO Compliance Act, along with Senators MURKOWSKI, BINGAMAN, AKAKA, WYDEN, and DORGAN. 
   This bill is designed to ensure continuous and rigorous monitoring of China's WTO commitments. It also provides new mechanisms in the Congress and in the Executive Branch to make sure that China complies with those commitments. 
   Twenty years of negotiations with our Asian partners have demonstrated that trade agreements are often not self-executing. This is just as true with China today as it has been with Japan over these last two decades. The Congress and the Administration must both be resolutely committed to monitoring and enforcement. Only then do our trade agreements succeed and bring the desired results. Inattention by the United States leads to inaction  by our trading partners. It leads to failure to achieve market opening objectives. 
   This bill will make sure that future Congresses and future Administrations, whether they are Democratic or Republican, will keep trade agreement compliance permanently at the top of the agenda with China. We must ensure that inattention never sets in. We must also ensure that other elements in the bilateral relationship not be allowed to prevent the United States from gaining the maximum trade and economic benefit from China's WTO promises. 
   Let me be clear that this bill is not designed to set conditions for the Congressional vote on granting China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR. Rather, this bill addresses one of the major concerns that many in the Congress have. That is, China historical record in complying with bilateral trade agreements has been spotty. So, how can we be confident that compliance with this agreement will be any better? I hope that enactment of this bill will provide some reassurance to Senators and House members in this regard. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in approving this legislation. 
   Let me outline the main provisions of the China WTO Compliance Act. 
   First, monitoring. The President must submit a detailed plan to Congress for monitoring Chinese compliance three months after China accedes to the WTO. The plan must be updated yearly and include detailed tasking responsibilities for each agency. 
   The General Accounting Office will be required annually to survey the top 50 American firms in each of five different categories. Companies that export non-agricultural goods to China. That export agricultural goods to China. That provide services in China. That invest in China. And that import goods from China. The purpose of the survey is to determine if China is abiding by its WTO commitments. The survey will also provide information about any problems confronted by those firms. 
   The International Trade Commission will report annually on United States-China bilateral export and import statistics. They will also, as best they can, seek to reconcile the different United States-source and China-source statistics. 
   The second element in the bill deals with compliance. USTR must submit an annual report to Congress on China's compliance with its WTO commitments. After analyzing this report, a majority vote of either the Finance Committee or the Ways and Means Committee would require USTR to initiate a Section 301 investigation of Chinese practices that do not abide by China's WTO commitments. If USTR then determines that China is violating any of those commitments, USTR shall initiate dispute settlement action at the WTO, unless there exists another more effective action. USTR shall consult with the Congress and provide an explanation of its action. 
   Going further, a majority vote of both the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee will require USTR to initiate immediately a case under the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO. 
   The bill also amends Section 301. It authorizes USTR to draw a negative inference if a country being investigated does not cooperate in providing information. This has become a serious problem with some of our trading partners. A 301 investigation can bog down when a country with a non-transparent trading regime refuses to provide detailed information. This provision provides an incentive for cooperation. 
   Third, the bill calls for a special WTO review of China. It is the Sense of the Congress that there should be a special multilateral process at the WTO for a thorough and comprehensive annual review of Chinese compliance. The bill directs USTR to propose that the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the TPRM, at the WTO execute such a review of China's trade policies every year. It also directs USTR to take measures to improve the TPRM process. 
   Finally, institution-building in China. Coming out of half a century of communism, China does not have the institutions necessary to carry out fully its WTO obligations. This bill requires the President to submit a plan to provide assistance to China to build those institutions necessary to fulfill the obligations China has made as part of its accession to the WTO. The bill expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should provide such assistance through bilateral mechanisms, in particular, through appropriate non-governmental organizations. It also provides for the possibility of some multilateral assistance under the auspices of the WTO. 
   Finally, because a primary beneficiary of the results of successful institution-building in China would be American business, efforts shall be made to develop cost-sharing with the private sector. 
   There has been a lot of talk about the need to ensure full Chinese compliance with its WTO commitments. This bill is an attempt to establish a system that will do just that. We need this legislation. And we need to pass PNTR as soon as possible. 
   Let me conclude with a few remarks about Chinese compliance with the Agricultural Cooperation Agreement, which went into effect in December. Three weeks ago, I initiated a letter signed by 53 Senators to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. In the letter, we insisted that China proceed with full and immediate implementation of that agreement. I was pleased to announce on Monday the first purchase by China under this agreement. 50,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest wheat. This is an important step that should be followed by other agricultural purchases.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very serious development in foreign trade. It is a development which hurts American interests. It has been brewing for quite some time, and it finally came to a head last week in Geneva. A World Trade Organization (WTO) appeals panel ruled against us in a case the European Union brought against American tax law. 
   The ruling was not a complete surprise. A few months ago, the WTO ruled that our laws for Foreign Sales Corporations, usually known as FSC's, are illegal export subsidies. We appealed that decision. We lost the appeal. The WTO said that we have until October 1 of this year to come into compliance with the ruling. 
   Why is the WTO dealing with this case to begin with? Why isn't it sticking to its mandate, which is international trade, and stay out of tax matters? 
   The EU brought this case to the WTO 2 years ago. In doing so, Europe broke an agreement with us that dates back to 1981. Congress passed the FSC in 1984. I remember very well all the work that we put into crafting the rules to place U.S. exports on a more equal footing with European competition. In crafting the rules, we relied on that 1981 understanding with the EU. It confirmed that foreign source income need not be taxed, and that failing to tax such income is not a subsidy. European exporters are not taxed on such income, and they enjoy value added tax rebates on exports as well. 
   This case is just another step in a European Union campaign which undermines the world trading system. 
   We saw it very clearly last year in the run-up to the Seattle ministerial. EU leaders tried in every way they could to avoid coming to the table to talk seriously about their number one problem: agriculture. 
   First, they started a public relations campaign to downplay expectations. In a number of meetings, they hinted that the Seattle talks would probably fail. Second, they tried to overload the negotiating agenda. They wanted to turn the trade talks into such a complex undertaking that we would never get to the real problem: EU agriculture. Third, they stalled in Geneva, so there wasn't any agreement on the scope of agriculture talks in Seattle. In 1995, they agreed to start agriculture talks in January 2000. But they wanted to put off getting down to business for as long as possible. 
   They are still trying to put it off. Putting it off hurts American farmers and agro-business. Putting it off hurts developing countries. Putting it off even hurts Europe itself in the long term. It just undermines confidence in the world trading system. 
   This FSC case makes things worse. Let's be very clear on what's going on here. We can set aside the European rhetoric about ``respecting international obligations'' in tax policy. That's not what this case is about. If the EU were serious about ``respect for international obligations,'' it 
   would take a close look at the tax policies of its members. This case is not about respecting international obligations. 
   This case is not about tax policy. If the EU were seriously concerned about the trade effects of tax policy, it wouldn't file a case in the World Trade Organization. That's no way to fix an international tax problem. Instead, it would seek multi-party talks in an organization like the OECD or the UN. But the EU doesn't really care about tax policy in this case. 
   This case is not even about money. The EU has no real commercial interest at stake here. They haven't demonstrated any appreciable adverse impact on European companies from US tax laws. In fact, a number of European companies benefit from FSC! They have domestic subsidiaries in the United States, and these subsidiaries have set up Foreign Sales Corporations. 
   So what is this case about? It's about revenge. Pure, simple revenge. The Eurocrats want revenge for losing WTO disputes with the United States over bananas and beef. That's an open secret. Everyone knows where this case came from. It didn't come from European manufacturers facing unfair competition from US firms because of FSC. It didn't come from European banks. Or from European consumers. Or from European farmers. It didn't come from the members states. It came from EU bureaucrats, the gnomes of Brussels. 
   They were angry over losing the beef and banana disputes with the United States. The cases were long and hard. They took years. The EU fought us all the way. They lost at every turn, because we were in the right. When they refused to correct their illegal policies, the WTO authorized us to retaliate legally. And we did. 
   For revenge, the Eurocrats wanted to poke us in the eye, and show us that they could hurt us. So they took this case, which had been sitting on their shelf for years. They dusted it off and sent it to the WTO, despite our 1981 agreement with them on tax policy. 
   Well, they're playing with fire. Using the WTO as an instrument of revenge is dangerous for them, and dangerous for us. The WTO is a five-year old child. Its  dispute settlement system is still young and fragile. The FSC case strains its resources, which are limited. But more important, the FSC case strains the political acceptability of the WTO system. 
   The political leaders of the EU should not have let this case go forward. It was a bad judgement on their part. Now it is in their interest and in the interest of the world trade system for them to settle this case amicably and fast. It will take wisdom and courage for them to do so. I hope they find that wisdom and courage.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to respond to comments made over the past week in the press and elsewhere questioning Vice President GORE's support of the superb agreement negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky with China as part of the WTO accession process. I have spoken with the Vice President. I am totally confident that he fully supports the Administration's position. He believes that the bilateral agreement is an excellent one. He believes that it is vital that the Congress approve permanent normal trade relations status as early as possible this year.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I regret I was unable to vote on the Iran Nonproliferation Act and two judicial nominations, but it was necessary for me to be in Montana today. 
   I traveled back to Montana to join with Montana farmers, Montana business people, and Montana government officials, and Montana economic development experts in Great Falls and Helena to greet a high-level Chinese agriculture purchasing delegation. This group is led by the Chairman of COFCO, the China National Cereals, Oils, and Feedstuffs Import and Export Corporation, and includes senior Chinese government officials. We provided this Chinese delegation with information about the opportunities Montana presents and educated them about the high quality and competitive agricultural products and value-added food products in our state. 
   I have been working for over 20 years to expand trade and open markets overseas for Montana and American agricultural commodities, value-added agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services. Increasing exports brings benefits to our farmers, our workers, and our communities in Montana. 
   China, in particular, represents a market of almost unlimited potential. I have worked hard for the last 10 years to expand trading relations between the United States and China. This year, I am leading the fight to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR. The full implementation of this agricultural agreement is a vital part of this effort to bring China into the WTO. It will ensure that Montana and the rest of America will benefit from the unique opportunities in China. The delegation that I brought to Montana this week is only the first step along the road to increased exports to China. 
   The outcome of today's vote on the Iran Nonproliferation Act would not have changed had I been present. This measure passed, 98-0, and I strongly support it. I do so for three reasons: it requires the President to report to Congress on foreign entities where there is ``credible information'' that they have transferred certain goods, services or technologies to Iran; it authorizes the President to impose measures against these entities; and it prohibits ``extraordinary'' U.S. payments to the Russian Space Agency until certain conditions are met. I voted for a similar bill in 1998, legislation which passed the Senate, 90-4, and was subsequently vetoed by the President. 
   I also support the outcome of the other rollcall votes that occurred in the Senate today, for the confirmation of two Federal judges. Kermit Bye, nominated to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the 8th Circuit, and George Daniels, nominated for District Judge of the southern district of New York, are both highly qualified judges. Both were confirmed today, by votes of 98-0. In both cases, my vote would have made the outcome 99-0. 
   Although I regret that I was unable to cast these three votes, I am pleased to have advanced the economic well-being of my state by continuing my fight to open markets for Montana agriculture.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the Agricultural Cooperation Agreement that was signed by the United States and China in December in Seattle. Although the negotiations for this agreement were held at the same time as the bilateral WTO accession negotiations between our two countries, this agriculture agreement is a stand-alone arrangement. According to its own terms, it formally entered into effect when U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky and Chinese Trade Minister Shi signed it. 
   This agreement deals with three categories of agriculture products--Pacific Northwest wheat, meat, and citrus. The agreement requires that sound science be used when evaluating agricultural imports into China. Specifically, the agreement ends the decade-long prohibition that China had against importing Pacific Northwest wheat. It provides for US government certification of meat packing facilities. And it eliminates unreasonable technical barriers to the export of citrus products from the United States to China. 
   On February 11, 52 other Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, joined me in sending a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, insisting that China needs to implement the Agricultural Cooperation Agreement immediately. We explained to President  Jiang that now is the time to buy our agricultural products. Words are fine. Agreements are fine. But what matters is the result--concrete commercial purchases. I would like to put a copy of that letter, along with a list of the 53 Senators who signed it, into the RECORD. 
   I am very pleased to announce that a high level Chinese agriculture delegation, including government officials, along with representatives from COFCO, the China National Cereals, Oils, and Feedstuffs Import and Export Corporation, will visit my state of Montana on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. This is a critical next step in securing the implementation of the agriculture agreement. 
   I will join with Montana agriculture, Montana business, and Montana economic development officials in Great Falls this week to meet this important delegation, to provide them with information about the opportunities Montana presents, and to offer them high quality and competitive agricultural products and value-added food products. 
   I have been working for over twenty years to expand trade and open markets overseas for Montana and American agricultural commodities, value-added agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services. Increasing exports brings benefits to our farmers, our workers, and our communities, including, of course, in the state of Montana. 
   China represents a market of almost unlimited potential. I have worked hard for the last ten years to expand trading relations between the United States and China. This year, I am leading the fight to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, PNTR. The full implementation 
   of this agricultural agreement is a vital part of this effort to bring China into the WTO and to ensure that American and Montana will take advantage of the unique opportunities in China. 
   I look forward to the signing of purchase agreements with China in the near future for Pacific Northwest wheat. Montana and China can help each other grow. That is what international trade is all about. 
 February 11, 2000.  President JIANG ZEMIN,  People's Republic of China,  Beijing, China.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes addressing a matter that is very important to the people of my home State of Montana but also to about 50 million other Americans. Universal access to technology and services all across our country is a very important principle in American history. From the Postal Service to electricity to phone service, we have all made sure, as a national policy, that all Americans have access to the basic services they need. 
   Now we need to make sure all Americans also receive universal access to another major service; that is, TV service, weather reports, emergency broadcasts, local news. All Americans should be able to get local news on their television set, to get information about their local communities. That is not available today for about 50 million Americans. In my State alone, 120,000 people, about 35 percent of the homes in Montana, receive video programming via satellite because there is simply no way else to get it. That is the highest per capita rate in the Nation. 
   We have more satellite dishes per capita than any other State in the Nation. We jokingly call the satellite dish our new State flower. It used to be the bitterroot; now it is the satellite dish. 
   The problem is, we in Montana have to watch the news from New York City or Denver or Seattle. We can't get local news from our local stations from our satellites. The technology isn't there. The satellite companies don't provide the service. Montana is not alone. In nine other States, at least 20 percent of the households depend on satellite broadcasts for TV reception. They can't get it with an antenna. They can't get 
   it from cable. They have to get it off the satellite. And in places such as Montana, with mountains, buttes, ravines, and gullies, all the different geographic conditions that occur in our State, there are many people who live on the outskirts of major towns who can't get local television signals with antenna, no matter how hard they try. They can't get any television. There are many communities and homes that are much too remote to receive news or TV coverage by cable. They are just too remote. 
   Why is it so many people can't get TV coverage that is important for ties to local communities? The major satellite companies have told us that the free market simply doesn't pay. It doesn't pay for the satellite companies to provide the signal to smaller communities. It does pay for the larger communities but not for the small. The satellite companies have told us they can only afford to market in the high-density urban areas. I understand that. All companies want to make as much money as they can. That is the American way. That is wonderful. But the difficulty is, as a consequence, there are many areas of our country that can't get TV coverage--that is, coverage at all--or cannot get local television, local news. 
   We can't rely solely on the profit motive. That drives America; it is wonderful. That is why American prosperity is doing so well and for so long. But we also have to be sure that it is not the only condition because otherwise we would still be cooking supper by candlelight in rural America. We would have to go down to the local telegraph office to communicate with friends. That is because without rural electric service or rural co-op service, that would be the case. 
   This map is very interesting, the one behind me to my immediate right. Under the most optimistic local-to-local plans--that is, where a satellite signal is sent down to communities so the communities can, from their satellite, get local television--only about 67 out of a total of 210 TV markets in the United States will get access to local channels via the satellite. The more realistic answer is probably about 40 markets will be served by satellite; that is, either by DirecTV or Echostar. Millions of households will get it in communities such as New York City and Los Angeles. 
   The red dots on the map are cities served, as of the end of last year, by satellite; that is, local service, local TV coverage, local news coverage served by satellite. As we can see, there are a lot of places in America without red dots. If you are in a city with a red dot, you can get local news by satellite. But if you live someplace else and not one of these red dots occurs, then you cannot get local news by  satellite. The orange-yellow dots are announced probable sites in the future. As I said, the most optimistic estimate is 67 markets served out of the 210; the most probable is about 40 markets served out of 210. 
   Let me tell my colleagues where my State ranks in terms of the probability of getting served with local coverage by satellite. I can assure you, we are not in the top 67. Our largest city in Montana is Billings. Billings ranks about 169 in the Nation out of 210. Butte, MT, is about 192. Glendive is up in the northeastern part of the market. That TV market is number 210; that is, out of 210 TV markets in the country, we are 210. So we have a ways to go if we are going to get satellite local news coverage. 
   This isn't a problem only in Montana. It is a problem in 16 States. Sixteen States have no single city among the top 70 
   markets, not one. They include half of the Nation's State capitals. A dozen cities with nearly 500,000 people each won't get service. From the Great Plains to Alaska and Maine to Mississippi, much of America is being left behind. 
   Why is this so important? Why is local-to-local broadcasting so important? Essentially because this is the heart of the community. One of the fibers that holds a community together is the ability to communicate within that community. The community is able to tune into a TV to hear about the local high school football team: how did they do? Did they win or lose? And local news, all the things that go on in a local community: what is happening in the neighborhood? Maybe there is a sale going on at a local store. There is a TV advertisement. You know what is going on in the community. There is a charity fundraiser. 
   Then look at some of the more dramatic reasons for local news accessibility: winter storm warnings, hurricanes, school closures, emergencies of one kind or another, floods, tornadoes. 
   There are a lot of reasons why we in all our communities want to know what is happening locally. As I said at the outset, there are about 15 million Americans who are not able to tune into their local TV stations, and we should find some way to solve that. 
   Last month, I heard from a good, solid Montanan, Gary Ardesson of Frenchtown, MT, which is about 20 miles outside of Missoula. Gary can't get any local channels--none whatsoever--either by antenna, or by cable, or by satellite. He wants to pay for it, but it isn't available. He just can't get it. So Gary asked why in the world should he be in this situation. What would Gary do if he wanted to get the latest storm warning? All he can do is stick his head out the window and put his finger up in the wind to find out what the weather is going to be. There is no other way except by radio. 
   He commented on the legislation we passed in the last session. He said: What is the point of legislation if they only implement it in the areas that can already receive local channels? That is what we did last session, but we didn't provide full coverage. 
   This is a problem not only for viewers; it is a problem for local TV broadcasters. Local broadcasters are vital to local economies. They provide jobs and an avenue for local businesses to grow. How? Through advertising. It is very important that we can keep our local broadcasters thriving. I think there are four main issues we have to address to solve this problem. 
   First, we have to assure that every household in America has access to their local television station. That is a given. Every household in America must have access to their local television station. 
   This can be achieved, I submit, through a loan guarantee program that encourages investment in infrastructure, whether it be satellite, cable, or some other new emergency technology. Loan guarantees are going to be necessary for those less densely populated parts of our country that need assistance, such as REA, the rural electric co-ops of not too many years ago, and such as telephone co-ops. It is a guaranteed service to all Americans. 
   Look at this chart. This shows where the Rural Utilities Service--the organization in the USDA that administers the utility service programs in our country, whether it be electric power, telecommunications, or whatnot--currently provides service. All 50 States currently have service under the Rural Utilities Service. The yellow dots are water and wastewater guarantee programs, loan guarantee programs. The other is electrical distribution. That is the red. The dark blue is electrical generation and transmission. Look at the green; it is telecommunications. That is what we are talking about--administering a loan guarantee telecommunications program. The Rural Utility Service isn't doing that. Those are the green dots. If you stand close, you can see the green dots--mostly in the East, where you would expect, and also you will find a few in other parts of the country. We have to make sure the program is properly administered, once we guarantee access. Certainly, the Rural Utility Service is currently providing service in all 50 States and are more than qualified to provide that service. 
   The RUS currently manages a $42 billion loan portfolio for rural America--$42 billion--including investments in approximately 7,600 small community and rural water and wastewater systems, and about 1,500 electric and telecommunications systems servicing about 84 percent of America's counties. They have been very successful. 
   This map shows the vast area that is covered. RUS's success in developing infrastructure in rural America has led to the infusion of private capital in rural infrastructure. For every $1 of capital that RUS provides to rural America, that leverages to $2 or $3 of outside investment. The Rural Utility Service is the logical team to make sure this program is properly administered. 
   Perhaps the RUS could consult with other agencies--the National Telecommunications and Information Association, perhaps--and that makes sense. But I think the core of the administration should be in the RUS. Some colleagues have suggested maybe new legislation for a new oversight board, a new bureaucracy, similar to what was provided for in the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999. 
   I have some concerns about that. My real question is, how can an agency successfully administer the loans when the guarantee decision is made independent of that agency? A critical step in implementing the loan is a clear understanding of the funded project. That is best achieved during the review of the applications, including the financial and technical feasibility analysis. 
   That brings the third issue. We must construct this program in a fiscally responsible manner, minimizing the cost and risk to the taxpayer. I think this goal can be achieved by utilizing an existing agency--one with a good track record. 
   RUS has done a good job. In 50 years, RUS has experienced not one loan loss in its telecommunications program. 
   That is, to me, a very good record. 
   Finally, I think we need to make sure the guarantee program is utilized to provide local-to-local service to all of America. I have heard from colleagues that Congress should require some level of private capital investment in conjunction with the loan guarantee. Some have even suggested that the loan guarantee should be perhaps as low as 50 percent. That gives me some pause because I don't want to have something set up with too many hurdles and redtape, which has the effect of increasing interest rates necessarily and therefore diminishing the likelihood that all of America will be served. 
   In summary, these are my four main criteria: One, every household must be served; two, the program must be administered by an agency with the necessary expertise, somebody with a track record that knows what is going on; three, the program must be cost effective and low risk to taxpayers; four, the program should not be structured in a manner that is so cost prohibitive to the private sector that it sits on the shelf unused. 
   So I say, let's move ahead and let's also keep this nonpartisan. There are some in the Senate who have suggested that maybe this issue is driven by partisan politics. Mr. President, I totally reject that notion; indeed, I find it offensive. 
   This issue doesn't belong to one Senator or to one party. This issue belongs to the American people--people who need service, people who are demanding that we act to provide them with  comprehensive satellite coverage. That is all this is. I call on the Senate to do that. That is what the people want. 
   The loan guarantee program that I am talking about was regrettably stripped from the Satellite Home Viewer Act in the eleventh hour of the last session. I say, let's put it back in in a nonpartisan way. I say that because all Americans who do not get local service would be very grateful. Let's do this not only for Gary Ardesson in Frenchtown, MT. Let's do it for all of the Americans in rural America who deserve the same service that people in the big cities are getting. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to focus on the budget debate in which this Congress is engaged. It is very important at the beginning to set priorities and parameters as we put a budget together that makes sense for our country rather than treating in isolation each individual spending or tax matter that comes before this body. It is very important that we step back and look at the bigger picture. 
   When a family or a corporation puts together a budget, they have to make all of their needs and desires fit into an overall budget plan. In the same way we should start out by making sure that all of our individual proposals fit into an overall budget plan. 
   I say this because some Members of the House are going to be moving specific tax bills in advance, without looking at the overall budget. The problem, obviously, is if we take very tempting separate items, such as a tax bill, say, a marriage penalty, or maybe it is an education tax bill, perhaps a retirement savings tax bill--it is very tempting to pass these in isolation and we are picking and choosing between different tax cuts before we even have agreed on how much money we have available. 
   Let's not put the cart before the horse. It's the same kind of helter-skelter approach that got us deeply into debt in the first place. Let's set our budget priorities first. 
   As we do so, we should keep two points in mind. First, we should be, if I may use the word, conservative. Let's keep the cork in the champagne and not put too much stock in ten-year projections that show a huge surplus. 
   I don't care how good your crystal ball is. Things change, and small changes add up to a lot over 10 years. 
   I would like to make a point about an article in yesterday's Washington Post that underlines this problem. It is a story by Eric Pianin and John Berry. Their basic point is the fragility of the long-term budget projections--whether they are the President's projections, the CBO's, or others. 
   Let me quote, ``Clinton's projections highlight just how tenuous those surpluses could be.'' 
   There is another example of this. This chart shows how difficult it is to predict the future and how quickly and how dramatically budget projections change. On the left, the red bar illustrates that 2 years ago, January 1998, the Congressional Budget Office projected the country would face about a $900 billion deficit over the next 10 years. 
   Just a couple of weeks ago, the CBO reached a different conclusion. Their conclusion was that we are going to have the benefit of a roughly $2 trillion budget surplus over the next 10 years. That is a swing of practically $3 trillion in just two years! Clearly, 2 years from now this $2 trillion projected surplus is going to look a lot different, as it will 3 years from now and 4 years from now. Therefore, let us not listen to the siren song of these huge projected surpluses based upon current economic estimates. I know the budget estimators do the best they can. But I sure wouldn't want to bet the farm that these new numbers will hold up for a decade. 
   The current economy is doing well. We want it to continue doing well, but there is no guarantee it will. Let's be careful. Let's be cautious. These projections of huge surpluses could fade. It could change very quickly. 
   The point came home to me in a conversation I had with the CEO of a major telecommunications company. 
   I said: Sir, does your company make 5-year plans? 
   He said: Well, yes, we do. 
   I said: How closely do you follow them? How well do you implement them? 
   He said: Well, we really don't. We try, but things change so quickly, we have to change and adjust. 
   Granted, telecommunications is a fast-changing industry. But we are a fast-changing country in many respects. Changes happen very quickly. Changes happen, particularly as our world gets more and more interconnected and more technologically advanced. With more and more technology and more factors involved in determining the course of our economy, it is more and more difficult to predict the future. It is a problem we face. 
   With all the inherent uncertainty about the future, let's be a little cautious when it comes to the Federal budget. And let's also adhere to the Hippocratic Oath, that is, ``first, let's do no harm.'' 
   I believe the prudent course is to adopt what I'd call a ``no regrets'' budget. 
   Policies that we believe make sense and address important needs irrespective of upticks or downticks in the economy. 
   To my mind, this means we should, first and foremost, reduce the debt.  
   That's plain conservative, common sense. During good times, you pay your debts, and you save a little. It also helps to protect Social Security and Medicare. Just paying down the debt will have a tremendous economic benefit to our country. 
   How? First, paying down the debt will free up more private capital so individual Americans can make more decisions along the lines they want, as they have in the last several years, which has helped boost this great economic growth. Paying down the debt means more private capital will be available. But perhaps more importantly, if the Federal government borrows less from the market, the private sector can borrow more. Government reduces its debt service costs and pressure on interest rates is reduced. And lower interest rates are a direct, tangible benefit to every businessman, farmer, home owner, and car purchaser. 
   Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said much the same thing yesterday morning. He told the Finance Committee that a major benefit of reducing the debt is to free money so that it is available to be productively invested by the private sector. 
   So, Mr. President, reducing the Federal debt is important to the continued growth of the private sector. 
   The second step is to set the right budget priorities. After debt reduction, we should invest where it will make the most sense for our economy. That means investment in people, investment in education, investment in infrastructure. 
   We can also do some good by creating incentives for private retirement savings. Retirees need more than just Social Security and we should address it this year. 
   And we should deal with other tax issues, too. These include reducing the marriage penalty, providing incentives for long-term health care, and helping communities conserve open space. 
   Those are all areas where I believe we can find strong bipartisan agreement. 
   I hope we could also find agreement not to go overboard with tax cuts. I know election years get the juices flowing. But I would just caution folks to remember our experience in the early 1980's with the exuberance for large tax cuts. 
   Two years after we enacted that tax cut--and I voted for it--Senator Dole had to come back and lead the damage control party. We had to increase taxes that year to repair the deficit problem. But it wasn't enough and we needed to do it again two years after that. 
   I don't know about my colleagues, but I've learned from that mistake. I don't want to lock in a big tax cut now only to find ourselves in two years digging out of a hole if the economy heads south. It's happened before! 
   Mr. President, I know that many observers have written off this year. They say it's an election year. That we won't get anything done. But we shouldn't write off this year quite yet. We have 120 legislative days left. It's not a lot of time. 
   But if we set solid budget priorities and we work together, then we can pass a budget that is responsible and invests in America, then this Congress can write a record of bipartisan accomplishment that will benefit all Americans. 
   I ask my colleagues to join together. If we do what is right--and we know what is right--we are going to be serving our country well. That is my plea. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true Montana hero--Jim Atkinson. His death, after a long battle with leukemia last December, was a great loss to me personally and to the State of Montana. 
   You know, we always talk about how important education is. Especially here in Congress, we talk about how children are the future and that we need to invest in that future, and that's true. But Jim Atkinson did more than just talk about education; he lived it. He was on the front lines every day, as a principal at Charlo Elementary and later as the vice president of the Montana Association of Elementary and Middle School Principals. 
   As an Administrator in the Montana school system, Jim was instrumental in the effort to modernize our State's schools. He realized quickly how important technology would be to students, and set up a computer lab for the Charlo school. Without people like Jim all our talk about education wouldn't amount to anything. His foresight and dedication to education in Montana made him a true hero. But there was more to Jim than just his job. 
   Originally a native of Abington, PA, it was the outdoors and the land that brought Jim to Montana. He was an accomplished mountain climber and fly fisherman. Montana's rugged peaks and blue ribbon trout streams had a hold on Jim's soul. And Jim was a true family man. He is survived by his wife, Luan, and his two sons, Sam and Tyson. 
   Mr. President, Jim was a young man. He was only forty-eight at the time of his death. He spent his life serving his community, educating children, raising his family and enjoying the land of our majestic State. Many men would be lucky to accomplish this much in a hundred years. I expect Jim's legacy will last much longer than that.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment at the administration's decision to appeal the Federal District Court decision that requires the appointment of environmental representatives to the advisory committees, the ISACs, that advise the Commerce Department and USTR on trade policy with respect to forest products. 
   At the recent WTO meeting in Seattle, President Clinton reminded all of us of the importance of making the trade policy process more open and transparent. I share the view that incorporating environmental and labor concerns into our trade policy is a necessary element in ensuring confidence in the global trading system. The need for openness and transparency is not only for international negotiations and dispute resolution, but also for the establishment of trade policy here at home. Indeed, the Clinton administration has been the principal advocate of this. 
   It is, therefore, surprising and disappointing that the administration seems reluctant to bring more openness and transparency into its own trade policy advisory committees. Specifically, in the case of the administration's proposals to reduce or eliminate tariffs on forest products (a goal that I share), environmental groups have raised legitimate issues about the impact on conservation. This should be part of our domestic debate. 
   I understand that enhancing the role of environmental and other groups in this advisory process raises some concerns at USTR and the Commerce Department. We don't want to make the process inefficient, and we must continue to protect confidential information. But, to my mind, we can increase openness and transparency without compromising efficiency or confidentiality. 
   I call on the administration to reconsider its policy and take the necessary measures to incorporate fully those who are trying to express legitimate environmental concerns. 
   Finally, let me be clear. If the decision by the Western District of Washington is overturned on appeal, I will introduce legislation mandating the appointment of representatives of the environmental community to these two advisory committees. 
   At this critical time when concerns over globalization threaten the consensus for expanding global trade, we must increase public confidence in government. That means more openness and transparency, not less.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that is tearing rural communities apart--methamphetamine. 
   Last week, our Nation's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, and his deputy, Dr. Don Vereen, came to Montana to focus on methamphetamine. We met with law enforcement officers, health care professionals, and concerned citizens. 
   As many of you know, methamphetamine is a powerful and addictive drug. It is considered by many youths to be a casual, soft-core drug with few lasting effects. But, in fact, meth can actually cause more long-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack. 
   Methamphetamine users are often irritable and aggressive. They have tremors and convulsions, their hearts working overtime to keep up with the frenetic pace set by the drug. Methamphetamine can stop their hearts. It can kill. 
   The psychological effects of meth use are also severe: Paranoia and hallucinations; memory loss and panic; loss of concentration and depression. 
   We have all heard these symptoms manifested around the country, particularly in rural America. 
   Time magazine reported just 2 years ago, in June 1998, on the meth problem faced in Billings, MT. Time found that until 5 years ago, in Billings--Montana's largest city--marijuana and cocaine were the most often used illegal substance of choice. Today, as reported in Time magazine, it is methamphetamine. 
   In 1998, the number of juveniles charged with drug-related or violent crimes in the Yellowstone County Youth Court rose by 30 percent. 
   In Lame Deer--that is the community of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation--kids as young as 8 years old have been seen for meth addiction. 
   Last November in our State, a meth lab blew up in Great Falls, leading to a half dozen arrests. 
   Sounds like awful stuff, doesn't it? But if it is bad, why is methamphetamine the fastest growing drug in Montana, and particularly over rural America in the last 5 years? Why did meth use among high school seniors more than double from 1990 to 1996? 
   The short answer is that methamphetamine provides a temporary high, a short-term euphoria; it feels good; in addition, increases alertness. Although the use of the drug later leads to a dulling of the body and mind, its short-term lure is one of enhanced physical and mental prowess. 
   Workers may use the drug to get through an extra shift, particularly a night shift; it gives them a real high. Young women often use meth to lose weight. It is interesting, but in our State over half of methamphetamine  users are women, single moms, stressed out, working. She needs a break. She takes the drug. It helps her get through the day or week. Athletes also use it to improve performance. People think it helps. It helps them get through the day, helps them to do what they are doing. They do not realize how much it hurts. 
   Therein lies the danger of methamphetamine. Folks think they can use it for a short time with no long-term ill effects--sort of like straying from their New Year's diet and eating a couple of pieces of cheesecake--but they can't do it, can't get away with it. 
   Consider this: Dr. Bill Melega is a doctor at UCLA. He researched the effects of methamphetamine on monkeys, giving them meth for 10 days. He found that not only did methamphetamine physically alter the brain, but these monkeys' brains remained altered 3 years after methamphetamine was administered. Again, 3 years after taking the drug, the brain still had not recovered. 
   Brain scans show that, whether it is postron or other forms of technology we have that scan the brain, when an individual is taking methamphetamine, the brain is significantly changed. As I said, in the case of monkeys--we do not have test results yet on human beings--it is permanently changed. 
   So meth is a problem. But is it reasonable to believe we can mobilize a community-wide effort against it? Is it possible to remove meth from Montana and all our communities? I say we can, but it is going to take a lot of work. 
   A few years ago, for example, in Billings, MT, a group of skinheads threatened Billings and its Jewish community with bodily harm. They threw bricks through windows of Jewish homes. They threatened violence on others and caused a huge problem in my State, particularly in Billings. 
   But what happened? The people of Billings mobilized. They mobilized to defend against that mindless hatred. They banded together, and they organized the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever in my State. Billings people, in addition to the police, law enforcement officers, and others--basically, the people--the community rose to the challenge and ousted the skinheads from Billings, MT. 
   Just a few days after yet another Martin Luther King celebration, we are given the chance all across our country to try again, with community efforts, to solve community problems, whether it is racial hatred, whatever it is--in this case, among others, this methamphetamine. We all have a part to play. 
   Kids, you should know that meth will hurt you. It might even kill you. Our communities need you to serve as examples of how to live a positive, drug-free life. You are doing it already through organizations such as SADD--the Students Against Destructive Decisions--Big Brothers and Sisters, Smart Moves, Smart Leaders. There are lots of organizations. 
   One encouraging sign in the fight against meth is the incredible people who have been working on this problem. 
   In my State of Montana, for example, there is a lady named Virginia Gross who for over a decade has been in the ``treatment trenches'' serving the most serious cases of meth addiction in Billings, MT. A Billings native herself, she got her start in the treatment area, working generally with emotionally disturbed kids. She saw that almost invariably these emotionally disturbed kids had a drug abuse problem tied with them. In doing intakes at a treatment center called the Rimrock Foundation, she treated her first meth addict 13 years ago. 
   There is virtually no literature on the subject, particularly on meth treatment, so she, on her own--working with this and that--developed her own treatment techniques--testing this, trying that--and she gradually learned what it takes to treat a meth patient effectively. 
   In the hundreds of patients she has treated since 1987, she points to one as her greatest success. This fellow, strung out since age 14 on drugs for more of his life than not, came to Virginia with a determination to try anything. He told her he would do whatever it took to beat his addiction. He knew he wanted to be clean, and clean he became. Three years after starting treatment, this former high school dropout got his GED, started college. He has gotten straight A's and aspires to be a forest ranger. He is a symbol of Virginia's and his own success and particularly a symbol of what young people can do who are on drugs and who want to get off. 
   Success can be achieved. Meth can be defeated. We all have a part to play. Parents, teachers, you must know the symptoms of meth use; recognize them. More importantly, you need to talk to your children. It is true that teens whose parents talk to them about drugs are half as likely to use drugs as those whose parents don't. If you talk to your kids, the chances your kids will take drugs is 50 percent less than if you don't talk to them about drugs. It is a proven fact. It is a statistic that is very amply demonstrated. 
   Finally, law enforcement, you have a critical part to play, too. Last week, again, the news in Billings reported that the crime rate has fallen significantly in the last 2 years, 10 percent this year alone. That is good news. But the bad news is, it is also true that Billings' violent crime rate has increased over that same time. I believe much of that is attributable to drug use. Until we get a handle on the drug problem, controlling crime is going to be a very steep uphill battle. 
   To that end, Montana must be a member of the Rocky Mountain High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA. It is a collaboration between State, Federal, and local law enforcement agencies. Then there is S. 486, the Meth Act, which passed the Senate last session and waits for action in the House. It provides longer prison terms for drug criminals, more money for law enforcement, education, prevention, and a wider ban on meth paraphernalia. All told, the bill increases Federal funding for law enforcement and education by over $50 million. 
   We are proud in our State to call Montana the last best place. We love our way of life. But in the past several years, we have found that even the last best place is not immune to the scourge of methamphetamine and all the trouble that comes with it. We have gangs. We have thugs. We have crime. We have drugs. We have a problem. 
   Today a report was released underscoring the fact that rural teenagers are much more likely to smoke, to drink, and to use illegal drugs than their urban counterparts. The report was commissioned by the Drug Enforcement Administration and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, focusing primarily on 13- and 14-year-olds. It showed that eighth graders in rural America are 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban counterparts. They are 50 percent more likely to use cocaine, 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana, 29 percent more likely to drink alcohol. Even more shocking, the report showed that rural eighth graders were 104 percent more likely to use amphetamines, including methamphetamine. That is double the rate of urban eighth graders. 
   We also have confidence in our State, as I know people do in other communities, that we can solve this, particularly in the face of such adversity. And this battle must be won. Meth 
   use in Montana and in other communities is much too important a battle to lose. So, kids, please understand what meth does to you. Serve as examples to your peers and what it means to lead a drug-free life. We need you. Parents, teachers, recognize the symptoms; talk to your kids. Law enforcement, your efforts are bearing fruit. You need more support and all of us, of course, will continue to help you, particularly here in the Congress, to get it. You need the help of the communities because community problems require community solutions. 
   One final note. Let me emphasize that last one: Community effort. This is only going to be solved in all communities across our country if it is a total community effort. Doctors have to get more involved. They have to not only get involved with the glamorous cases of heart transplants and hip replacements but also meth use, addiction. Doctors have to get much more involved. Pediatricians have to talk much more to parents of the kids when the kids come into the office. Our faith community can do still more, much more throughout our country in cracking down on meth, working hard to  work together with other communities, parents, obviously teachers and schools, treatment centers. 
   In addition, treatment is so important. So many people are arrested for meth use or for peddling meth. They are addicted. They are put in prison. What happens? After they are out of prison, they are back on meth. There is virtually no treatment or there is very little treatment of incarcerated persons in prison because of meth. There has to be treatment. Treatment is tough. Treatment takes a long time. It takes more than 30 days. It takes more than 60 days. It takes more than 90 days. Treatment usually takes up to 1 to 2 years. Halfway houses, you have to stick with it. You have to stick with it if we are going to solve it. 
   Look at it this way: If we leave meth users alone in the community, it is going to cost the community, estimates are, $38,000, $39,000, $40,000 a year. That is the cost of that meth-addicted user to communities, whether it is in crimes, stealing to support the habit, all the ways that addicted meth users are destructive to a community. To put that same person in prison, it is going to be very costly; that is, prison without treatment. It is going to cost maybe up to $30,000. Incarceration today costs about $30,000 a person a year. Treatment alone is about $6,000 to $8,000. Treatment in prison is going to be less than letting the person free out on the street in the community. It pays. 
   Taxpayers, rise up. Recognize your tax dollars are spent much more efficiently with treatment, treatment of addicted meth users in prison, than without the treatment, working with law enforcement officials, coordinating all your efforts. 
   Again, I emphasize that final point. Methamphetamine is a national problem. It is a State problem, but it is more a community solution, all the peoples of the communities working together, certainly with States and certainly with Uncle Sam, but you have to do it together as a well-knit effort. That is how we will solve this scourge in this country. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I hope not only for the most part but for the whole part, Mr. President. The Senator from Utah is exactly correct. I must confess, I learned a lot about the scourge this past week when Gen. Barry McCaffrey was in Billings for a whole day and half the next day with his people, meeting with treatment people the whole time, various aspects of the people who deal with this. It is one big problem, as the Senator from Utah said. It is really vicious stuff. 
   Once you are on it, it is worse than cocaine or heroin. It is harder to withdraw. The treatment is longer. I mean, this is wicked stuff. 
   I might add, one fact I learned is that in our State--and I hope it is not true in Utah--we have a high percentage of users who shoot it with needles, or IV. Therefore, if we don't stamp it out, we are going to face a high incidence of hepatitis C and HIV. Dr. Green, an expert on the subject in Billings, was shocked last week when he came to understand the high rate of users who inject meth instead of taking it orally or smoking it. 
   All I say is that I hope parents and communities will rally and knock this thing out. It is really bad stuff.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is very unfortunate that the Senate finds itself in virtually the same position as we did last year with appropriations matters. As my colleagues will recall, we voted on a giant omnibus appropriations bill which contained eight appropriations bills, plus numerous other authorizing legislation. It ran on for nearly 4,000 pages and weighed in at some 40 pounds. It was called a ``gargantuan monstrosity'' by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD. 
   But it was a monstrosity not just because of its length. It was also in the size of its insult to the democratic process, to individual Senators, and to the people they represent. 
   It was bad enough that no Senator was able to read the bill before they were required to vote on it. Worse still was the fact the bill was presented to the Senate in a ``take it or leave it'' form. No amendments were permitted. Every Senator was effectively muzzled. 
   I voted against that bill. Not because it didn't contain good provisions, good for the country, and good for my State of Montana. It did. I opposed that bill because writing such an important piece of legislation should not be done behind closed doors among a small group of people with no recourse for the others. I said at the time that the process dangerously disenfranchised most Senators, House Members, and the American people. 
   Many of my colleagues agreed with my sentiments then. And there were statements that this would not happen again. But it has. 
   True, this bill is somewhat shorter. It covers only five appropriations bills, not eight. It has fewer authorizing bills attached to it. 
   However, it still was written largely by a relatively few people, members of the majority, representatives from the Administration, a few members of the minority. And all behind closed doors, again. 
   But the bigger danger this year is that we are passing major bills by reference. The text of four appropriations bills and four authorizing bills appears nowhere in this bill. Instead, this bill provides for their enactment by referring to them by number and date of introduction, which just so happens to be less than 48 hours ago. 
   Members of the Senate do not have this language before them. Even if we could offer amendments, how would we do it? How can you amend a bill that is included only by reference? Even more fundamentally, will bills that are enacted into law ``by reference'' withstand a Constitutional challenge that they violate the presentment clause? 
   The courts will have to decide the Constitutional issues. But it is one more reason why I believe this is a very dangerous process. It further erodes the rights of the minority, indeed the rights of all Senators. Coming, as I do, from a state with a small population, we depend greatly on the Senate to protect our states' interest, something that cannot always be done in the House of Representatives, where population determines voting power. 
   Mr. President, we already face a population that is increasingly cynical of government and those who serve it. People believe more and more that government does not look after their interests, but only after special interests. And the more we operate behind closed doors, without an open, public process, the more we feed that cynicism. And the more we encourage mistrust. 
   That is not healthy for our democracy or our people. One of the best things Montanans did when we rewrote our State constitution in 1972 was to require open government, at all levels. It has helped keep government officials honest and helped the people have faith in that government. I wish this process were as open. 
   Someday, I hope that the Congress will return to the open process on appropriations bills and authorizing bills we had not so long ago. We could debate issues, offer amendments, make compromises, win, lose. But all in front of the people. 
   But this bill goes too far in the other direction and therefore, I cannot support it.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, along with Senators HARKIN, DASCHLE, KERREY, DURBIN, JOHNSON, WELLSTONE, CONRAD, ROCKEFELLER, BRYAN, REID, LEAHY, WYDEN, and MURRAY, I am pleased to introduce a bill today on behalf of our country's rural satellite consumers. This is a bill to amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, appropriately entitled, ``the 21st Century Rural Utility Service Rural Development Enhancement Through Local Information Act.'' 
   We all know that modern technology has made it possible to broadcast TV programming directly from satellites. Nationwide, over 11 million households subscribe to satellite TV, and that number increases by over 2 million households a year. 
   Rural areas have come to depend on the network coverage that satellites provide. In Montana, where over 35 percent of homes depend on satellite broadcasting for their TV reception, this development has been a real boon. 
   While satellite broadcasting has improved the quality of life for folks in rural America, it hasn't been perfect. Satellite systems haven't been able to carry local broadcast stations. So local viewers haven't always been able to get local broadcasting.  
   And this is not just a problem for satellite subscribers. It's a problem for the local TV broadcasters and for the fabric of local communities. Local broadcasters play a key role in our communities. 
   They provide local news, local weather, and public service programs. Viewers depend on these broadcasts to find out about what's going on in their community. When the school board, PTA, and city council are meeting. Or when there's a parade or a fund-raiser for their church or civic groups. 
   Local broadcasters are vital to our local economies. They provide jobs, and they allow local businesses to grow through advertising. In short, the importance of local broadcasting is evident in all parts of community life. 
   And they also provide network programming: NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX. Nineteen of the twenty TV stations in Montana are affiliated with one of these networks, or with the Public Broadcasting System. 
   These stations air national news, sports and entertainment at times of the day when people with jobs and kids can watch. 
   Without these local broadcasts, you might miss the evening network news because it comes on before you get home from work, or because it airs late at night. People want local network coverage because it works in their lives. 
   Until now, technology has not provided for rebroadcast of local signals by satellites. Many rural residents haven't been able to get decent reception over the air. 
   Of course, we in the Senate cannot change technology or geography. What we can do is change the law. We can make local into local broadcasting a reality, and we should. 
   Last spring, we passed H.R. 1554. At the time, we neglected an important responsibility. The language we passed would have required the turn-off of network programming to many rural satellite viewers. 
   It would have done nothing to help the many local broadcasts in smaller cities and towns. A big oversight. 
   Following the vote, I wrote a letter to the conference asking that it pay attention to the needs of the many viewers, communities, businesses and stations that had been ignored. Twenty-three of my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, signed the letter. 
   As you know, Mr. President, yesterday the House passed the omnibus appropriations bill, and the Senate is slated to take the same vote this evening. Mr. President, I was very disheartened when I learned that the ever important loan guarantee provision was pulled out of the Conference Report on the Satellite bill at the last minute. That is why I'm introducing this bill today, because this loan guarantee will help America's 11 million rural satellite consumers. It's time for us as lawmakers to say ``we care about those folks up in 2 Dot that simply want to watch local news.'' This is our chance to expand rural access so that no matter how large or small your town is, you're going to be able to enjoy the benefits of Satellite TV. 
   This bill includes a loan guarantee that will make it possible for all local stations to be broadcast on satellite. Not just those in the very largest cities and towns. Without this, the other ``local into local'' provisions of the Satellite Home Viewer Act are an empty promise to the rural and small town Americans who depend on satellites. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to holding hearings on this bill during our adjournment and coming back to see a swift resolution to this issue in January. It is time, no, it's overtime, for us to act on this important issue.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks about a serious problem for people in our country who do not live in our Nation's cities; that is, the loss of satellite TV access to network programming. 
   We all know that modern technology has made it possible to broadcast TV programming directly from satellites. Nationwide, over 11 million households subscribe to satellite TV. That number increases by over 2 million households every year. 
   Rural areas have come to depend on network coverage that satellites provide.

   While satellite broadcasting has improved the quality of life for folks in rural America, it has not been perfect. Satellite systems have not been able to carry local broadcast stations. So local viewers have not always been able to get local broadcasting. 
   This is not just a problem for satellite subscribers; it is a problem for local television broadcasters and for the fabric of local communities. Local  broadcasters play a key role in our communities. They provide local news, local weather, and public service programming. 
   Viewers depend on these local broadcasts to find out what is going on in their community: When the school board, the PTA, and the city council are meeting, or when there is a parade or a fundraiser for their church or a civic group. 
   Local broadcasters are vital to our communities. They provide jobs, and they allow local businesses to grow through advertising. In short, the importance of local broadcasting is evident in all parts of community life. 
   Local broadcasters also provide network programming: NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX. Nineteen of the 20 TV stations in Montana are affiliated with some of these networks or with PBS. These stations air national news, sports, and entertainment at times of the day when people with jobs and kids can watch them. 
   Without local broadcasts, you might miss the evening network news because it comes on before you get home from work or because it airs late at night. People want local network coverage because it works in their own lives and in their local community. 
   Until now, technology has not provided for rebroadcast of local signals by satellites. Many rural residents have not been able to get decent reception over the air. 
   Of course, we in the Senate cannot change technology or 
   geography, but what we can do is change the law. We can make local-into-local broadcasting a reality, and we should. 
   Last spring, we passed H.R. 1554. At the time, we neglected an important responsibility. The language we passed would have required the turnoff of network programing to many rural satellite viewers. It would have done nothing to help the many local broadcasters in smaller cities and towns. It was an oversight. 
   Following the vote, I wrote a letter to the conference asking they pay attention to the needs of the many viewers, communities, and stations that had been ignored. Twenty-three of my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, signed the letter. 
   As you know, Madam President, the conference on the satellite bill has paid little attention to our request. The language of the conference report, now titled the ``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999,'' includes some important new provisions. 
   It does allow satellite viewers in poor reception areas, the so-called ``grade B contour'' viewers, to continue to get network programming from satellites. Without this, many satellite viewers will lose their network TV at the end of next month. 
   It also includes a loan guarantee that will make it possible for all local stations to broadcast on satellite, not just those in the very largest cities and towns. 
   Without this, the other local-into-local provisions of the act are an empty promise to rural and small town America that depends on satellites. 
   Last week, the House passed the conference language by a near unanimous vote. But in the Senate, a few Members--and I might say, on the other side of the aisle--are blocking a vote on this conference report. They say: We promise to have more hearings. We should have another committee look at this. 
   They might as well say: Let them watch the radio. 
   The Senate should act now to ensure that the conference report language becomes law. It is clear the majority of the Senate is ready to vote to approve the measure, just as the House did. Instead, we are offered a weakened version attached to the omnibus appropriations bill, which we will get sometime soon, and a weak promise to do something next year. 
   This is a no-brainer. There are many people in rural America who would like to add satellite TV, network programming from their local stations. It is that simple. We have it within our power today to very simply pass a provision and provide for the financing, a loan guarantee. We all know it is going to pass. We all know we are going to do it. But there is one Senator who wants it in his committee. And I say, that one Senator represents a State where there are a lot of people who I think want local-into-local broadcasting from the satellites. 
   There are millions of Americans who depend on their satellites and want local network coverage--not national network coverage--or at least the option to get both local and national. 
   This is a no-brainer. I get more mail on this subject than any other subject. I daresay, Madam President, you probably get a lot of mail on this subject, too. I know a lot of Senators probably get as much mail on this one subject as any other. And we can simply solve it today very easily. It makes no sense for us not to. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I speak on behalf of 11 million Americans, at least, many of them residents of the State of Alaska. We haven't solved the satellite home viewer matter. I don't see why we can't. It is very simple. All we have to do is put that loan guarantee in, which is very simple. If there are any wrinkles, they can easily be worked out. It makes no sense for us to go home without passing the loan guarantee provision so that the satellite viewers can rest assured and so that those who are going to put up satellites and develop satellites for local-to-local coverage are able to do so. I cannot understand, on behalf of those 11 million Americans who can't understand, why in the world we don't do something that is pretty simple.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I hear my good friend from Alaska and the majority leader. They have States that have the same concerns as do we. Not for a moment do I doubt the intentions of both of the Senators. They are two of the most honorable men I have had the pleasure to know. They are wonderful people. 
   But I also know how the Senate operates. I also know that the best intentions often don't materialize and something happens. I also know that some of the regulations I suspect the Senator talked about--it is a lot easier for the FCC to write regulations than not knowing in the abstract what the regulations are. I don't know what they can really do that is substantive or effective in the next several months, or whatever it takes. 
   I also know that the only objection to us proceeding really is one Senator who, for some reason, thinks he should have jurisdiction over this. It is an ``inside baseball'' objection. It is not a substantive objection in any great way. 
   I also know there is a lot in this omnibus bill that was written pretty quickly, where many minds got together to get something done. I also know that necessity is the motherhood of invention. If we want to do this, we will find a way to get it in. 
   I am suggesting that a vast majority of Members of this body want to do it. I suggest that 90 percent want to do it. There is an objection not based on substance but based on another reason. 
   I very much appreciate the desire of the Senator from West Virginia to speak. But I might say that my objecting to proceeding here does not deprive the Senator from speaking. He will find ample opportunity, and I support his right to be able to speak. This is so black and white, so much of a no-brainer, and there are millions of Americans in rural America who want this thing, and there is so little reason not to do it. 
   So I will object.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I earlier objected to bringing up the continuing resolution because I felt it made much more sense to include the loan guarantee along with the other provisions in the omnibus bill that will be taken up later providing for local-to-local satellite network service. 
   I thank the Senator from Mississippi, as well as my colleague from Montana. I have been working with my colleague today to figure out some way to lock in even more having loan guarantees passed by this body and by the other body. 
   The other body has made a similar commitment in a colloquy about 2  hours ago to make sure this is passed so rural viewers of America have the opportunity to have local satellite service. 
   I compliment my friend from Montana for working so hard on this. He has worked very hard, as well as others. I am not going to hold up the continuing resolution to shut down the Government. In the whole scheme of things, we have our own priorities and know what the priorities should be. But it is important to get this provision in here because it does make it even more certain we are going to get this loan guarantee provision passed in the next year. 
   I thank the majority leader. He has been very gracious in working this out, as well as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who I know wants to work this out as well, and my good friend from Montana. I also thank the Banking Committee chairman. He has been very helpful.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense-of-the-Senate Resolution regarding the urgent need for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to resolve its civil rights discrimination cases. On behalf of Senator BURNS, the bill's cosponsor, and myself, I urge the Senate to recognize the urgency of this situation. 
   Mr. President, there exists a strong public policy against discrimination against minority groups, whether the discrimination is committed by private individuals or by the Government in the operation of its programs, and it is our firmly held belief that whenever discrimination occurs in the conduct of Government programs, the responsible Government agencies should take quick and aggressive action to remedy such discrimination. 
   I am most concerned that over the past year, such action has not been taken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Civil Rights. In fact, many Montana civil rights cases that my office and that of Senator's BURNS have been working with are seriously backlogged in the system and have consequently remained unsatisfactorily addressed. 
   We have worked hard with the Montana Department of Agriculture's Farm Agency to resolve these cases. The Director of the FSA and the State FSA Committee has worked hard to resolve any outstanding problems concerning its programs and have made certain that these kinds of problems to not occur in Montana. I commend their outreach efforts in ensuring the equitable delivery of the Agency's programs to all eligible Montana recipients. 
   We need a better working relationship with the USDA's Office of Civil Rights to bring the outstanding cases to resolution in a timely manner. Repeated phone calls and requests have yielded few answers. For that reason, I am offering this resolution which binds the agency to its mission of facilitating the fair and equitable treatment of USDA customers and employees while ensuring the delivery and enforcement of civil rights programs and activities. Further we hope to commit the USDA to treating its customers with dignity and respect as well as to providing quality and timely products and services. Finally, the resolution resolves that not later than March 1, 2000, the Secretary should resolve all the outstanding cases of alleged civil rights discrimination by the Department of Agriculture. 
   It is high time to bring this issue to resolution, and I appreciate the Senate's consideration of this important matter.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and the administration on reaching an agreement this week with China on WTO accession. This demonstrates that a policy of ``engagement with a purpose'' works. I believe the Chinese leadership, in particular Premier Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin, have shown foresight, courage, and vision in making the commitments necessary to conclude this bilateral agreement. I am also glad President Clinton worked so diligently over the last several months to finalize the arrangement. 
   I believed in April that the April 8 arrangement with China was a good one. My preliminary evaluation of this week's agreement is that it goes beyond the April 8 agreement and provides further benefits to American economic interests. 
   There are still several steps before China can accede to the WTO. 
   China must complete other bilateral agreements, in particular with the European Union. Next, the protocol of accession must be completed. Then, the focus of attention will turn to us in the Congress. 
   In order to receive the benefits we negotiated with China, the United States has to grant China permanent normal trade relations status. To do this, Congress has to amend the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 
   I am confident that a majority in both Houses will vote to amend Jackson-Vanik. But it will take a lot of work. The administration, the agriculture, manufacturing, and service industries, and those of us in the Congress who have followed these negotiations and the U.S.-China relationship closely over the years, must educate and explain to our colleagues about the benefits of the agreement reached this week and the advantages to the United States of having China in the WTO. 
   As we in the Congress begin to think about this issue and deliberate on it next year, I see four principal benefits to the United States. 
   First, this week's agreement opens up new markets in China, with its population of 1.3 billion, for American farmers, manufacturers, and service industries. This will help sustain American economic growth. 
   Second, the agreement gets China into the global trading system, which forces them to play by the rules of international trade. 
   For perhaps the first time in history, China will be accountable for its behavior to the outside world. The dispute settlement system at the WTO is far from perfect, but it forces a country to explain actions that other members believe violate the global rules. And, when a violation is found, it puts pressure on that country to comply with the rules. In addition, there is a little known feature of the WTO called the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the TPRM. Every few years, a country's entire trade system is reviewed by all other members. Again, this type of scrutiny of China is virtually unprecedented. 
   Third, the agreement will help strengthen the economic reformers in China, especially Premier Zhu Rongji who has clearly been in a weakened position this year. Economic reform, moving to a market economy, transparency--that is, opening up, less secrecy--direct foreign investment, listing of companies on overseas markets--progress in all these areas is of vital importance to the United States as they relate to stability in China, as they relate to accountability, and as they relate to a growing middle class. 
   Fourth, Taiwan, the 12th-largest economy in the world, has almost completed its WTO accession process. Yet it is a political reality internationally that Taiwan cannot join the WTO before China. So, with China's admission to the WTO, Taiwan will follow very quickly. All of us should welcome that. 
   The Congress has been concerned about many aspects of the U.S.-China relationship: espionage allegations, nuclear proliferation, human rights, and Taiwan. These are all serious issues, and we must confront each one head on. 
   But, I, and I believe most Members of Congress, are able to look at each issue on its own merits. When Congress examines closely the arrangement for Chinese accession to the WTO, I am confident that Members will conclude that extending permanent normal trade relations status to China is now in the best interest of the United States. 
   I don't want to sound pollyannaish about this. Once China is a member of the WTO and the United States has granted permanent NTR status, the real work of implementation begins. We have learned over the years that implementation of trade agreements takes as much effort, or even more effort, than the negotiations themselves. The administration will have to provide us with a plan about implementation. We in the Congress will have to devote additional resources and energy to ensuring full Chinese implementation. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced a bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office to provide the Congress with additional resources to do exactly that. I hope my colleagues will look at that proposal and give it their support. In addition, I will be introducing some measures to help ensure that the administration--this one as well as future administrations--never deviates  from the task of full implementation of agreements with China. 
   In conclusion, this is a good agreement. It serves American interests. 
   We have a lot of work ahead of us to help implement it and to follow up next year to make sure it is implemented. It deserves our support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY in introducing the Downtown Equity Act of 1999. This bill will make the federal government a better partner with local officials when it comes to locating federal offices in a community. It will establish in statute a clear preference for federal offices to be located in the central business areas of a community. Why is this important? 
   We all know the many problems facing community leaders as they chart the future course of their cities and towns. They must balance development patterns, employment, historic preservation, city services, transportation, and many other factors to arrive at a plan that makes the most sense for them. 
   In many cases, the Federal government is a major source of employment and economic activity in these communities. That is particularly true in smaller cities and towns, where federal employees can make up a larger percentage of the employment base than in our large metropolitan areas. 
   But too often, local officials find themselves battling with federal agencies over where to locate, or relocate, Federal facilities. The desires of agencies to locate on the outskirts of a small town can conflict with the needs of the community to preserve a vital business center downtown. 
   I have seen firsthand some of these location battles in Montana. Communities such as Helena, Billings and Glasgow, have seen agencies threaten to move out of the downtown area, removing a linchpin of economic development that supports other local businesses. In another case, this time in Butte, an agency looked to abandon an historic building downtown in favor of a new site closer to the Interstate. 
   The impact on these communities from such actions can be devastating. In Helena, for example, the relocation of the federal building would have removed over 400 Federal workers from the area and dealt a major blow to plans to revive the downtown core, known as Last Chance Gulch. And in Glasgow, a small town even by Montana standards, the relocation from the central business area to a new site on the outskirts of town threatened the survival of other businesses downtown and contributed to sprawl. Yes, even in the Big Sky state, sprawl is a threat to the vitality of our communities and the beauty of our environment. 
   Many of these conflicts between communities and Federal agencies stems from the confusing, and sometimes conflicting, jumble of laws, executive orders, and regulations. It almost seems as if there is a provision to justify almost anything an agency wants to do. One law tells agencies to locate in rural areas. An executive order tells agencies to give priority to central business areas. No wonder agencies are confused and community leaders are angry. 
   Mr. President, that's not right. We should have a clear, simple to understand policy when it comes to location of Federal facilities. Furthermore, that policy should make it easier for the Federal government to help community leaders who seek to maintain the vitality of their downtown areas. And that is what our bill does. 
   First, as a matter of policy, it states that locating federal facilities in central business areas is good for the economy and the livability of communities. 
   But more importantly, the bill implements that policy by requiring that the head of each Federal agency give first priority to central business areas when locating, or relocating, Federal facilities. This requirement could be waived if it would materially compromise the mission of the agency or if it would not be economically prudent. But those would be exceptions to the general rule that downtown areas should be the preferred area for Federal offices. And the downtown areas will be determined by local officials, not Federal agencies. 
   This bill will be good for our communities. And it will be good for the Federal government. 
   In closing let me express my appreciation to my colleague from Vermont for all the work that he has put into this issue. His leadership has been instrumental in crafting this bill. I look forward to working with him to bring this bill through the Environment and Public Works Committee and before the Senate early next year.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a long list of issues must be addressed in the next round of the multilateral trade negotiations that kick off in Seattle in 4 weeks. Agricultural trade is at the very top. Other issues include further reducing tariffs, repairing the WTO dispute settlement process, removing restrictions on trade and services, increasing opportunities to sell to governments, avoiding measures that restrict the growth of electronic commerce and figuring out how to put a human face on trade law consideration of the relationship between trade and labor and between trade and the environment. 
   There is another issue that has received virtually no attention at all. 
   Yet it is of critical importance to the United States, to most other nations, and to the world trading system itself. I refer to the problem of Japan, the second largest economy in the world. A country where the markets for our goods and services remain far more closed than they should be. 
   The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I am introducing today, along with Senator GRASSLEY, urges the administration to pay much more attention to Japan in the next trade round than was the case in the past. 
   I want the administration to work overtime to ensure that Japan makes commitments that will genuinely open its markets. And the administration must then ensure that Japan meets those commitments. Paper agreements will not suffice. Agreeing to broad principles is unacceptable. Negotiations in the next trade round must lead to clear results in Japan. There must be meaningful, measurable change in the way Japan's markets operate. 
   Historically, the relationship between multilateral and bilateral trade commitments made by Japan, and then whether there is actual change in Japan's markets, has been tenuous, at best. The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, in its report ``Making Trade Talks Work'', documented this problem of implementation and results. 
   In the Uruguay round, Japan did not have to make the kind of significant changes that were required of many other major trading countries. Including the United States. Even where Japan agreed to open its market, such as the rice market, the out-of-quota tariff rate is still in the range of 500 percent. That is not a misquote. It is Five Zero Zero, 500 percent tariff on rice coming into Japan from the United States. I am worried that in the next round, the Japanese Government will be able to minimize the commitments they make. And then, in a uniquely Japanese way, they will be able to minimize the implementation of those commitments and obligations. In earlier trade rounds, Japan agreed to the GATT Government Procurement Code. But the United States found that we had to negotiate special bilateral agreements with Japan in order to get genuine access to their government market. We negotiated multiple arrangements on computers, supercomputers, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, and satellites. Even with these arrangements, access to Japan's market has still been a major problem in many of these areas. The GATT system has not worked well here. In the Uruguay round, we were so focused on other problems, especially in Europe, that we missed a lot of opportunities with Japan. I am concerned that the same thing may happen again. I certainly do not want to take away from the focus on agriculture and other priorities we have for the next round. But I want to be sure that we do not let Japan off again. 
   Japan seems now to be working overtime to protect its trade-distorting policies in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The Advanced Tariff Liberalization efforts would have been further along but for Japanese opposition at APEC. Now, Japan is trying to hide its protectionist policies behind the banner of the ``multifunctionality'' of agriculture. That is, they claim that farming plays an important role in a country's social and cultural fabric, trade liberalization cannot interfere. Of course, farming is integral to the social fabric of many nations, including our own. But that is not an excuse for trade protection and making other countries pay those domestic social costs. 
   At the same time, Japan is playing a leading role in criticizing United States trade laws and in working with other countries to challenge our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in the next round. Some speculate that this is just another attempt to undercut American initiatives in the new round. Japan could, and more important Japan should, take a leadership role in a number of areas. After all, few countries in the world have benefited more than Japan over the past half century from an open world trading system.  
   Japan could take significant steps to make its regulatory system more transparent and less burdensome. They could table a broad based services liberalization proposal that would encourage others to follow. Japan could lead the effort to put more transparency into the government procurement agreement. It could lead on electronic commerce. And, of course, it could deal with those agriculture policies that are at the top of the agenda. 
   This resolution calls on the administration to focus on Japan in the next round, to set out specific expectations for the changes desired in Japan, to ensure that Japanese commitments made in the round will truly lead to change in the Japanese market, to work with other major nations to ensure that these changes occur, and to consult closely with Congress and the private sector, including manufacturers, agriculture, service providers, and NGOs, throughout the negotiations. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in helping ensure full participation by Japan in the round and in ensuring that we will benefit from Japan's commitments. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was very impressed with the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts earlier when he showed us the charts of how minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. As I recall the chart of the Senator, it was very dramatic, showing with the minimum wage increase of $1 over 2 years, still we would not keep up with inflation in real terms. 
   He had a second chart. If you chart the poverty line, you will see the minimum wage has constantly been below the poverty line. So for all those who are worried about statistics and figures, rest assured this increase in the minimum wage proposed by the Senator from Massachusetts is not above inflation. It may be true in 1 year's time it is above what inflation might be in that single year, but on the question whether minimum wage has kept up with inflation or not, historically it has not kept up with inflation. 
   Second, I want to relate a personal story which made a huge difference to me.

   Mr. BAUCUS. That is an excellent point. I regret telling the Senator from Massachusetts I was not able to see that chart, but I am glad the Senator has explained this point. It is absolutely true. If you increase productivity, and everybody knows productivity means the amount of output per worker hour--if productivity has increased dramatically, that is all the more reason why it is unfair the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. The amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts will help accommodate that. 
   The point I was going to make is when I last ran for reelection, I walked across our State. I will never forget talking to a woman, a single mom, who told me how hard she worked to try to stay off welfare. She had a minimum-wage job in my home State. 
   She tried for a couple of years to stay off welfare. She was determined to stay off welfare. It was a matter of principle, a matter of pride. She slept on the sofa in her parents' home, she did all the things she could do to cut corners so she could raise her young child and stay off welfare. But she finally realized with her minimum-wage job and the day-care costs--I have forgotten the exact percent, but it was 30 or 40 percent of her take-home pay went to childcare--she could not do it. She had to finally give up and go onto welfare because her minimum-wage job did not earn her enough money for her and her child to survive. 
   We can help get people off the welfare rolls by increasing minimum wage. It is not the total solution. There are lots of parts to that problem, lots of parts to the solution. But certainly, raising the minimum wage makes a huge difference. 
   I might also add, in my home State of Montana there is a very 
   unfortunate economic trend. In 1946, Montana ranked 10th in per capita income. In roughly 1992 or 1993, Montana ranked not 10th anymore but about 35th or 36th. Where does Montana rank today in per capita income? It depends on how you calculate it, but 48th, 49th, or 50th. 
   The State used to be a natural resources, commodity-based State with mining business and timber industries that had good-paying jobs; in agriculture income was up too. Today, those mining jobs, those timber industry jobs, those commodity-based resource jobs are disappearing because of the greater importance of value added. We are now becoming a tourism State, a recreation State, a service industry State. And service industries pay very low wages compared with commodity-based industries. 
   I am sure this is true in lots of other States in the Nation. An increase in the minimum wage is going to help increase the pay for service jobs, which is going to help a lot. I might also add keeping workers' pay up only makes sense; it is only fair because of all the profits so many companies have received, particularly over the past couple or 3 years, the best evidence of which is the skyrocketing increases of the stock indexes on the various stock exchanges. 
   It was said earlier this is just a minimum wage for younger people. Mr. President, I am sure you have experienced this. When you stop in McDonald's, you go to a store, say a Penny's or some store downtown, you are going to find a lot of medium-age people and older people working there. I am astounded at the number of older women who work at McDonald's. I am astounded. This is not only a younger person's issue. In fact, if statistics were shown, my guess is it would be more of a women's issue and a medium-age issue--people having a hard time making ends meet, not school kids working for pocket change. 
   Not only should there be an increase in the minimum wage--and I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is more than fair--the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is paid for. I ask consent to speak for 5 more minutes

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts is paid for. What do I mean by that? By that I mean that the cost to the private sector of this increase, by CBO estimates, might be roughly $30 billion over 10 years. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts has several key tax cut provisions that would help offset whatever cost businesses might experience in paying the increased minimum wage. I would like to highlight just a couple. 
   One of the main provisions is a small business pension startup tax credit. We want to help small business. We want to help small business provide pensions for their employees. We all know one of the big problems today is that while big businesses usually provide good pensions for their employees, small businesses do not, because of their narrower profit margins. It is very difficult to begin a small business. Startup costs in particular make the early years very difficult, because you have to pay that payroll tax on the first day of business whether or not you make a profit, and when you start out in small business you are not going to make a profit that first day. You don't have to pay income taxes, but you have to pay that payroll tax. Small businesses therefore have a very hard time doing what a lot of those small businesses want to do: Set up a pension fund for their employees. 
   If we are going to solve the retirement problem of this country, we certainly have to reform Social Security, and we certainly have to increase private savings. But we all know that a third leg of the retirement stool is pension benefits. We clearly need more incentives so small business can provide pension benefits to their employees. They will be better employees. They will be more likely to stay there. They are going to be more committed to the business. And they are going to be more committed to helping that company make a buck. Our package has a tax credit for small businesses, about $4 billion, to help make that happen. 
   What else do we do? We accelerate the 100-percent deduction of health insurance for the self-employed. The Republican bill does that, and so do we. It is very important that self-employed people get the health insurance deduction quickly. 
   Other major highlights: Our bill has a tax credit for information technology training expenses. We have heard it many times that a lot of small firms cannot find enough good employees. There are not enough around. We provide a tax credit to those companies for technology training expenses. It makes a lot of sense. 
   We also provide $2 billion over 10 years for a low-income housing tax credit, to help reduce housing costs of the buildings so many workers earning minimum wages live in. 
   We provide estate tax relief. Strangely, that is not in the bill offered by the other side. We offer estate tax relief targeted to family-owned businesses. 
   We increase the unified credit by $450,000 phased in to the year 2003. 
   In addition, we increase the small business meals deduction up to 60 percent in the year 2002. These are all provisions targeted to small business. 
   Rather than risking dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund, however, we pay for our provisions. 
   Why do I say all that? Because the alternative offered on the other side is much more expensive. It will lose about $75 billion in revenue and there are no offsets for the lost revenue. Our proposal provides offsets for the $28 billion tax cut. The major offsets are extending the current Superfund tax and, second, closing corporate tax shelters. We close down a lot of loopholes in current law of which many companies are taking advantage. 
   Let me say a couple of words about the ``pay for.'' Right now, the balance in the Superfund trust fund is declining dramatically. In 1996, the balance in the Superfund trust fund was about $4 billion. The estimate for this next year is about $1 billion. 
   Why is that important? That is important to continue cleanups under the Superfund Program. If the trust fund is declining rapidly and gets close to zero, we are not going to have the cleanups this country wants. That is, ground water is going to be polluted, drinking water polluted, hazardous waste in the  soil. It is very important we extend the Superfund provisions so the trust fund has the requisite dollars to continue cleanups, irrespective of whether we modify the Superfund law. I hope we do. But the trust fund is going to decline to zero pretty quickly whether or not Congress reauthorizes the trust fund. 
   Second, if we continue this Superfund tax, the Appropriations Committee is more likely to fund Superfund. Technically, it does not have to though it usually appropriates dollars anyway. If the amount of money in the trust fund continues to be level and does not taper off--and I note that it has been tapering off without the continuation of the tax--it is more likely the Appropriations Committee is going to find the dollars for Superfund cleanups. If we do not reinstate the trust fund, what is going to happen? Instead of the polluter paying for the cleanup, it will be the general revenue taxpayer who will pay to clean up. The polluters will not be paying for it; the general revenue taxpayer will pay for the pollution caused by major companies. It is imperative we 
   extend the Superfund tax. 
   The second major ``pay for'' provision we have in our bill is targeted toward tax shelters. Every time Congress shuts down some abusive tax shelters, tax attorneys are so smart, they figure out another loophole and a way to beat the system. What we are saying is for $10 billion over 10 years, let's enact a provision which makes transactions such as this much more difficult. 
   Many organizations testified there is a problem that needs to be addressed in this area. The American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, the American Association of CPAs, and many others have testified there has to be a solution to this problem. 
   Even Congressman ARCHER has admitted we have been very successful in shutting down about $50 billion of specific shelters over the last 5 years, and those are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a lot of practitioners. 
   So to summarize reasons to support our amendment: No. 1, we increase minimum wage because it makes sense, and lets people keep up with inflation. No. 2, we give tax breaks to small businesses that need it. They are very directed and targeted to the tune of about $28 billion. No. 3, we pay for our tax breaks in a very fair way. Contrast that with the other side, which stretches out the minimum wage increase, which hurts people and, in addition, has a tax bill which is not targeted. 
   I ask for a few more minutes.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a chart. I noticed the Senator from New Mexico was looking at it with a quizzical expression on his face. The source is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Everybody has a chart these days. Essentially, this chart shows the assumptions. This line shows the on-budget deficit. 
   The chart assumes we will continue 1999 discretionary spending levels inflated for present CPI and historical levels of emergency spending, which is an average of the last 8 years. It only addresses spending. What this chart does not show is how much the deficit is going to increase if we pass the tax cut bill from the other side, about $75 billion. 
   This chart shows that, even without the tax cut the other side wants to enact, we are not going to reach a surplus until the year 2005 under current scorekeeping. If you add to that the $75 billion tax cut, it is clearly going to be a lot later before we even get a surplus. Do not forget, you have to add in the last interest and expenses that otherwise would be available. 
   This is a no-brainer. Let's increase minimum wage fairly. Then let's enact tax provisions, tax cuts targeted to small business. Let's pay for it in a responsible way. Otherwise, we have the other side which is not paid for, a huge tax break which the President is going to veto anyway. So let's pass something the President will sign.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I rise to send three separate bills to the desk. I am introducing these three pieces of legislation because I am very concerned about the direction of U.S. trade policy. Since the end of World War II, America has maintained a strong domestic consensus on the importance of open markets, allowing us to lead the world into an era of unprecedented growth. That consensus is fraying at the edges. Divisions over the role of labor and the environment have helped to undermine it. 
   These divisions have prevented us from re-instituting fast track negotiating authority, which lapsed nearly five years ago. While we hesitate, the rest of the world continues to move forward on economic integration. Regional trade arrangements in Europe, Latin America, and Asia put U.S. exporters at a competitive disadvantage. We lose overseas markets to foreign competitors who enjoy trade preferences for which our farmers, manufacturers and service providers are ineligible. In my home state of Montana, wheat exporters have lost their share of the Chilean market to Canadian farmers, who are not subject to the 11% Chilean import duty that Montana farmers face. 
   If we cannot agree on a global fast-track bill, then we should institute fast-track authority for specific countries where we have strategic commercial and political interests. In doing so, we should choose countries which not only share our commitment to open markets, but also share our values for environmental quality and labor rights.  
   I recently outlined some broad principles on trade and the environment in a statement here on the Senate floor. FTA's should be consistent with those principles. In addition to addressing the environment, they should also firmly support core labor standards. 
   As to the countries, the bills I am introducing provide authority to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements with three important trading partners: Singapore, the Republic of Korea and Chile. Taken together, these three countries buy about $40 billion worth of U.S. goods annually. 
   For a number of years, the United States has considered, informally or formally, negotiating FTA's with all three of them. Soon after signing NAFTA, we talked to Chile about acceding to it as the fourth NAFTA partner. Chile waited patiently for Congress to give the President negotiating authority. That authority never arrived. Since then, Chile has gone ahead and signed bilateral trade agreements with both Mexico and Canada. 
   Similarly, we broached the notion of either an FTA or accession to NAFTA with Singapore several years ago. Of all the countries of East Asia, none is more committed to open markets than Singapore. Negotiating an FTA not only makes commercial sense, it also reinforces our engagement in the Pacific Basin. 
   Finally, the Republic of Korea is a country which has made enormous economic and political progress in the past two decades. It is now in the midst of a very painful restructuring forced upon it by the Asian financial crisis. An FTA with Korea would lock in the gains--both economic and political--of the past, much as NAFTA did for Mexico. Recently, the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative said that an FTA with Korea was an interesting idea, but that the only way to get there was to resolve our bilateral trade disputes. I think that's backwards. FTA negotiations are a way to resolve these issues. 
   The bills also establish a general policy framework for negotiating free trade agreements. They require that FTA's address the full range of issues, from guaranteeing national treatment and market access, to protecting intellectual property. They require that FTA's address electronic commerce, an area where the United States has a strong commercial interest. And hey require that FTA's address the labor and environmental issues. 
   I entered the Senate not too many years after Congress passed the original fast-track legislation. At that time, the notion of ``intellectual property'' was something novel. The idea that ``intellectual property'' should be considered in trade negotiations was ridiculed. Many said that patents, copyrights and trademarks were domestic issues, and thus not appropriate subject for trade agreements. But the United States insisted that the world trading system address these issues. We put a lot of political capital behind it. Today, nobody questions the appropriateness of WTO rules for trade-related intellectual property rules. 
   I firmly believe that in the near future, we will see the same result with trade-related labor and environmental issues. We cannot--and should not--avoid these issues. So the bills I am introducing require that FTA's address trade aspects of labor and the environment. 
   We must identify potential environmental consequences--both positive and negative--of trade agreements, and put in place mechanisms to deal with any adverse impacts. Similarly, we must reaffirm our commitment to core labor standards through a mechanism dealing with any adverse impacts that trade agreements have on labor markets. 
   Mr. President, we need to send a strong signal to the rest of the world that the United States intends to continue its leadership of the global trading system. The Africa Trade Bill that we passed here this week was an excellent step in the right direction. We must continue to make progress on opening markets for American farmers, manufacturers and service providers. Negotiating bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries will support our multilateral negotiations in the WTO. 
   Just as we negotiated NAFTA and the Uruguay round at the same time, we should pursue bilateral free trade agreements with Chile, Korea, and Singapore while we are negotiating the next round in the WTO.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill I believe will provide important benefits for our country's small businesses and the millions of people who work for them. The Small Employer Pension Start-up Incentive Act (SEPSI) will provide help to small businesses who want to help their employees save for their retirement. 
   Congress has spent a great deal of time recently exploring the impact on our country of the impending wave of baby boomer retirements. Much of this debate has centered around strengthening the Social Security Trust Fund, so we can keep the promise we made to all working Americans that Social Security will be there for them when they retire. During this debate, however, we have all but neglected the important role the private pension system plays in American's retirement security. 
   Social Security was never intended to provide the sole source of income for our retirees. Despite that, however, it is the only source of retirement income for 16% of elderly Americans. And it is the primary source of income for two-thirds of all retirees. Unless we can change this disturbing trend, preserving Social Security for the 21th Century will not be enough--there will still be far too many Americans who will spend their retirement years one step away from poverty. 
   In addition to preserving Social Security, we must help Americans better prepare for their retirement years. When the President submitted this budget this year, he proposed dedicating most of our projected surpluses to create Universal Savings Accounts for all Americans. I strongly believe the concept behind the USA proposal was a good one. If our projected surpluses actually materialize, we have an unprecedented opportunity to plan for our nation's future, to make the kinds of investments that will pay off for ourselves and for our children. Helping strengthen our private pension system is one of those key investments we should be making now, before the wave of retirements begins. 
   An important place to start is with our small businesses and their employees. Over 38 million workers in this country work for small businesses, that is, companies with less than 100 employees each. And even though almost everyone employed by a large company has access to a pension plan through their employer, only 20% of small business employees have pension plans available where they work. This means 31 million working Americans have no opportunity to save for their retirement through their employers. 
   Small business owners don't offer plans, not because they don't want to, but because they simply can't afford to. Administrative costs are disproportionately high for businesses with few employees, as are the costs associated with meeting all of the regulatory requirements that can apply to pension plans. And their employees, who frequently earn minimum wage and don't 
   have access to health insurance either, couldn't afford to set money aside for their retirement even if their employers offered pension plans. 
   The bill I am introducing today will help reverse this trend. The Small Employer Pension Start-up Incentive Act will provide two new tax credits to small businesses that are providing pension plans to their employees for the first time. The first credit will help defray the administrative costs that accompany starting a new pension plan. It will provide up to $500 per year in tax relief for small businesses to compensate for the administrative costs they incur in providing a new plan. The credit would be available for three years, for employers with up to 100 workers. 
   The second credit goes right to the heart of the pension problem--it helps subsidize the contributions employers make into a new plan on behalf of their employees. Studies have shown that pension participation increases dramatically when employers offer to match employee savings. But in far too many small businesses, neither the employer nor the employee can afford to set aside the money. My bill will provide a 50% tax credit for any employer contributions into a new pension plan on behalf of their lower paid employees, up to a maximum of 3% of the salaries of these workers. The credit will be available for the first 5 years of any new qualified pension plan offered by a small business employing up to 50 workers. 
   I believe that enactment of the Small Employer Pension Start-up Incentive Act will help dramatically increase the number of Americans working for small businesses that can begin saving for their retirement. Providing these tax credits to small businesses, along with the other pension reform proposals that are included in S. 741, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act I introduced with Senators GRAHAM and GRASSLEY, will go a long way toward helping Americans plan for a secure retirement in the 21st century.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this bill is a fitting tribute to our beloved former chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the late Senator John Chafee. I commend our new Chairman, Senator SMITH, for conceiving of this tribute, and am pleased to join him and others in introducing the bill. 
   Over the past week or so, many of us have spoken of the sadness we feel at Senator Chafee's passing. We have spoken of his contributions to legislative debates, and in particular the work he did to improve our major environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act. 
   The bill we are introducing today shows another side of Senator Chafee's work. He wasn't just interested in issues that bring headlines and accolades. When he came to work each morning, he tried to make things better, however he could, in ways both large and small. 
   The Coastal Barriers Resources System was one of those relatively small, but significant, accomplishments. Very few people have heard about it. But it's made a difference. 
   Senator Chafee proposed the Coastal Barriers Resources Act in 1981. It was enacted into law in 1982 and reauthorized in 1990. 
   The act establishes the Coastal Barrier Resources System, which comprises about 3 million acres of fragile coastal habitat covering 2,500 shoreline miles. Within the system, certain types of federal assistance, such as flood insurance and funding to replenish beaches, is prohibited. If someone wants to build in one of these areas, such as along a beach that is highly edible and in the frequent path of hurricanes, fine. 
   But taxpayers will not help foot the bill. 
   In this way, the act promotes two simple, common-sense ideas: conservation and thrift. 
   It promotes conservation because coastal barriers are very important and fragile ecosystems. Senator Chafee put it this way, at the first hearing on his bill, in Providence in 1982. He said:  
   These beaches and islands are places of incredible beauty that deserve to be protected so that they can be open for enjoyment by everybody, all the citizens of our country.  
   He continued:  
   The grassy dunes, salt marshes, and tidal estuaries of the barrier islands [also] provide essential areas where healthy wildlife populations can find shelter, food and a tranquil place to raise their young.  
   By discouraging development in these areas, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act promotes conservation. 
   The act also promotes thrift. Simply put, it's a waste of taxpayers' money to subsidize development that not only harms the environment, but that also is likely, at some point, to be swept out to sea. 
   When he signed the act into law, President Reagan said that it ``will save American taxpayers millions of dollars.'' and that's turned out to be the case. 
   Conservation and thrift. Good Yankee virtues, characteristic of John Chafee. 
   One more thing. In his eulogy last Saturday, former Senator Danforth talked about how John Chafee tried to bring people together. 
   This is yet another example. When all the painstaking work was done, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act reflected a bipartisan consensus. It was supported by virtually everyone--from the National Taxpayers Union, to the Red Cross, to the major environmental groups. It was enacted with only four dissenting votes in the entire Congress. 
   It brought people together. 
   Mr. President, two weeks ago, Senator John Chafee introduced a bill to reauthorize the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. It turned out to be the very last bill that he introduced. 
   The bill that we are introducing today takes a further step. It names the system that he created, and nurtured, the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System. 
   It is a modest, but fitting, tribute.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate will pass the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Reserved Water Rights Settlement. The legislation ratifies the Compact approved by the State and the Tribe in 1997. I was proud to sponsor this legislation in the 105th with Senator BURNS as a co-sponsor, and had the 2nd Session of that Congress lasted a few more weeks, I believe the bill would have been approved by the Senate. Once again this year, Senator BURNS and I jointly introduced this legislation. The passage of this bill is the culmination of 16 years of extensive technical studies and six years of rather intensive negotiations in our state involving the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the Montana State government, off-Reservation county and municipal governments in north-central Montana, local ranchers, and the United States Departments of Justice and Interior. 
   The 122,000-acre Rocky Boy's Reservation sits west of Havre, Montana on several tributaries of the Milk River on what was formerly the Fort Assiniboine Military Reserve. Unfortunately, the portion of the land reserved for the Chippewa Cree is rough and arid. Without irrigation, much of the land is not suitable for farming. Recent studies have demonstrated that the Reservation could not sustain the membership of the Chippewa Cree Tribe as a permanent homeland without an infusion of additional water. The development of a viable reservation economy calls for more water for drinking purposes, as well as for agriculture and other municipal uses. In 1982, acting in its fiduciary capacity as trustee for the Tribe, the United States filed a claim for the water rights of the Chippewa Cree in the State of Montana general stream adjudication. Were it not for the negotiated settlement represented by this legislation, divisive and costly litigation would be pending between the State, the Tribe, the United States and non-Indian ranchers for many years to come. Fortunately, in 1979, the Montana legislature articulated a policy in favor of negotiation and established the Montana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate compacts for the equitable division and apportionment of waters between the state and its people and several Indian tribes claiming reserved water rights within the state. 
   From the initial meeting in 1992, to the conclusion of an agreed on water rights Compact in 1997, the State, the Federal Government and the Tribe acted in good faith and worked together to explore options. This culminated in passage of a resolution by the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council to ratify the Compact on January 9, 1997. Following overwhelming approval by the Montana Legislature and appropriation of funds for implementation, Governor Marc Racicot signed the Compact into state law on April 14, 1997. Subsequent negotiation, in which staff from my office assisted the State and Tribe, resulted in approval by the United States Departments of the Interior and Justice and drafting of this bill by the three parties. 
   The litigation filed in State water court in 1982 is stayed pending the outcome of this bill. Once passed, the United States, the Tribe and the State of Montana will petition the Montana Water Court to enter a decree reflecting the water rights of the Tribe. 
   I thank my colleagues for supporting this very positive legislation. After years of hard work and negotiations, we have a victory to be thankful for at last. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was very disappointed last week when it appeared that we would not have a chance to act on this very important piece of legislation. I was disappointed for several reasons. 
   First, because there's a lot more at stake here than the four basic elements of this bill: CBI, Africa Trade, TAA and GSP. All four are important, and I will say a few words about each one of them. 
   But even more important is the signal that we send now. At the end of this month, the United States will host the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle. The WTO writes and enforces the rules governing some $6 trillion in international trade. Delegations from over 130 nations will come participate in the meeting. They will launch a new global round of negotiations aimed at expanding trade. 
   All of those delegations will have a common concern: Does the United States still intend to lead the world on trade? They will look at the way we deal with the trade bill before us as an indication of how they should answer that question. 
   The signals we have sent them recently are not encouraging. 
   First, we have failed to pass legislation granting negotiating authority to the U.S. Trade Representative. This undercuts our ability to persuade other nations to offer concessions, since we are not in a position to make credible offers. 
   Second, the United States has not put forward the kind of visionary, far-reaching proposals needed at the onset of trade talks. Rather than leading the way forward, we seem to have adopted another strategy: offend the fewest number of people as possible. 
   While we send these weak signals, other countries have moved into the breach to advance their own interests. The European Union and Japan mounted campaigns to paint us as foot-draggers on trade. They say that our proposals for trade negotiations are too narrow to allow for any real bargaining. They claim that they want to talk about the full range of trade issues, while we want to pull major portions of the trade system off the table. 
   We know what they are really up to. They want to undercut the talks and make them drag on for years. That way they can avoid living up to their responsibilities on agriculture. Unfortunately, a number of countries are persuaded by the picture of America's trade policy that Europe and Japan are painting. 
   This bill is the only opportunity the Senate will have before the Seattle meetings to show where America stands. It is vitally important that we pass this legislation to demonstrate our commitment to free market principles, and to open, fair trading system. 
   Mr. President, I filed two amendments to the bill, both of them trade-related. Both of them are on issues which are extremely important to Americans. I was very disappointed that we were locked out of discussing them last week. 
   One of the amendments allowed for tariff cuts on environmental goods as part of a global agreement in the WTO. The measure has the support of both business and environmental groups. This is a rare instance where both sides of the trade-environment debate agree on something. It's a shame that the Senate cannot move 
   forward on something so sensible. 
   The second amendment concerned agricultural subsidies. American farmers are the most productive in the world. But they're being frozen out of foreign markets by European and Japanese subsidies. I filed an amendment that would fight back by funding our Export Enhancement Program. 
   This amendment required the Secretary of Agriculture to target at least two billion dollars in Export Enhancement Program funds into the EU's most sensitive markets if they fail to eliminate their export subsidies by 2003. It's time to start fighting fire with fire. This ``GATT trigger'' should provide leverage in the next round of the WTO in reducing grossly distorted barriers to agricultural trade. 
   In addition to these amendments, Mr. President, I also filed a resolution in the form of an amendment about another important trade issue: telecommunications. It calls on the Administration to continue to pursue efforts to open the Japanese telecommunications market. This is another example of how Japan must shoulder its responsibilities as a major trading nation. It cannot benefit from access to foreign markets unless its offers access to its home market. It's simply a question of fairness. 
   Mr. President, I voted against cloture last week because I objected to the way the Majority Leader handled the bill. I was denied the ability to do what the people of Montana sent me here to do: debate and pass legislation. But I support the bill itself. I support each of its  elements--the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and the renewal of both Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Generalized System of Preferences.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand on the floor of the world's greatest deliberative body. I've been proud every time over the past twenty years that I have had this privilege. I can think of no greater honor than to discuss with my Senate colleagues issues of vital importance to our nation. 
   So I am deeply distressed that I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss important trade issues. Last week, the majority leader chose to cut off consideration of amendments to the Africa bill, the only trade bill which will reach the floor of this honorable body. That bill included amendments which had bipartisan support. Because of this bizarre process, we can't even act on Senator HARKIN's amendment to combat child labor, which has widespread support. 
   I had filed two amendments to the bill, both of them trade-related. Both of them issues which are extremely important to Americans. I am very disappointed that we were locked out of discussing them. However, with the new filing of cloture, I hope that we may have the chance to talk about these important matters. 
   One of the amendments allowed for tariff cuts on environmental goods as part of a global agreement in the WTO. The measure has the support of both business and environmental groups. This is a rare instance where both sides of the trade-environment debate agree on something. It's a shame that the Senate cannot move forward on something so sensible. 
   The second amendment concerned agricultural subsidies. American farmers are the most productive in the world. But they're being frozen out of foreign markets by European and Japanese subsidies. I filed an amendment that would fight back by funding our Export Enhancement Program. 
   This amendment required the Secretary of Agriculture to target at least two billion dollars in Export Enhancement Program funds into the EU's  most sensitive markets if they fail to eliminate their export subsidies by 2003. It's time to start fighting fire with fire. This ``GATT trigger'' should provide leverage in the next round of the WTO in reducing grossly distorted barriers to agricultural trade. 
   I voted against cloture last week because I objected to the way the majority leader handled the bill. I was denied the ability to do what the people of Montana sent me here to do. But I support the bill itself. I support each of its elements--the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and the renewal of both Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Generalized System of Preferences. 
   I have long supported efforts to extend additional tariffs preferences to the Caribbean Basin. But with conditions. The benefits should be conditioned on the beneficiary countries' trade policies, their participation and cooperation in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (``FTAA'') initiative, and other factors. This trade bill is substantially similar to the version I supported in the 105th Congress with some reservation. 
   I see a flaw in the bill, however, and would like to work to repair it. The bill suggests criteria the President can use when deciding whether to grant CBI benefits. It is a long list of about a dozen items. Criteria like Intellectual Property Rights. Investment protections. Counter-narcotics. Each one is important. The bill should make these criteria mandatory. 
   In particular, I believe that the President should be required to certify that CBI beneficiaries respect worker rights, both as a matter of law and in practice. We can't maintain domestic support for open trade here at home unless our programs take core labor standards into account. 
   We want to help our Caribbean neighbors compete effectively in the U.S. market. But we don't want them to compete with U.S. firms by denying their own citizens fundamental worker rights. 
   It only seems reasonable that as we help the economic development of these nations, we also help them enforce the laws already on their books. The majority of these countries already have the power and only need the will to ensure that their citizens see the benefits of enhanced trade--decent wages, decent hours and a decent life. 
   Overall, I believe that CBI parity is the right thing to do--if it does what it is intended to do. That is lift the people of the hurricane devastated countries out of poverty and ensure them a better way of life. 
   I also believe that the U.S. must lead by example. Sensitively to labor and environment must play a role in our trade decisions and actions around the world. 
   It's tragic that partisan politics keeps the United States Senate from taking these actions. 
   I have the same concerns about labor in terms of the African Growth and Opportunity portion of the bill. But I supported the Chairman's mark, which included a provision requiring U.S. fabric for apparel products produced in eligible sub-Saharan African countries. 
   Developing markets is in the best interest of us all. And the trade bill would help Africa move in that direction. But this bill is about more than trade. It is about hope. 
   It is about bringing the struggling nations of Sub-Saharan Africa into our democratic system. It is about establishing stability and a framework wherein the citizens of these nations can enjoy the fruits of prosperity. It is about building a bridge between the United States and Africa that will be a model for all nations. 
   The third part of the bill renews the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. This program is vital to help our workers adjust to the new forces of globalization. 
   I have seen the effects of this program in Montana. We have been well served by the efforts of Gary Kuhar, Director of the Northwest TAA Center in Seattle, Washington. 
   Impact on Montana--Montana currently has six firms affected by TAA funding, including: 
   Montana Moose--Christmas ornament operation, 
   Ranchland--a cattle operation, 
   Mountain Woods--furniture designer, 
   Western States--pellet operation, 
   Sun Mountain Sports--manufacturer of golf bags and other ripstops, 
   Burt and Burt--wind chimes, and 
   Kahlund Enterprises--picture frames producer. 
   In fact, the renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance translates to 330 Montana employees impacted and approximately $44 million in gross annual sales preserved. 
   This legislation is long overdue. While we delay, certified firms anxiously await funding. This is fundamentally unfair--especially for firms fighting import competition that is beyond their control. 
   They cannot afford to wait while TAA is caught up in the annual battle for funding as the ``perennial bargaining chip'' for other trade proposals. That's just ineffective government. It's time to pass this legislation. 
   Finally, let me say a word about GSP renewal. This is the fourth part of the trade bill. This is also a question of effective government. Over the years, the program has lapsed periodically when renewal legislation was delayed. The latest lapse occurred on June 30. Four months later, we still haven't acted on its renewal. 
   Who gets hurt? Not just foreign companies. A lot of American firms get hurt. That includes both American importers and exporters. A lot of the American firms produce abroad and then export to the United States. Much of this is internal company trade. That's the reality of today's global economy. 
   When GSP lapses, these companies are suddenly required to deposit import duties into an account. Customs holds the money until renewal legislation is signed. Eventually the companies get their money back. But they don't know how long renewal legislation will take. So they don't how much they'll have to set aside, or how long the money will it be in escrow. 
   How can we expect businesses to operate efficiently under such conditions? These cycles of GSP lapsing and then being renewed represent government at its worst. We have a responsibility to provide business and consumers with a consistent, predictable set of rules. We need to fix this GSP lapse as quickly as possible. 
   Mr. President, a lot of effort, a lot of thought, a lot of time has gone into this bill. Much time has also gone into formulating amendments. It was a great disappointment to see this effort unravel over partisan politics. We may have a second chance this week. Let's not squander the opportunity. We can and should work together to pass this bill. 
   We were elected to his body to pass legislation not to bicker. Let's do what the people sent us here to do. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy Seniors Act of 1999. Prescription drugs are a hot topic these days. From the lawn of the White House to the TV screen in your house, everyone is talking about prescription drugs, and for good reason. Americans have the greatest health care system in the world: The best doctors, the best research, and the most effective prescription drugs. That doesn't mean anything if thousands of seniors can't afford to use them. We are creating a system where the well-off can buy the best health care and the poor can afford little more than an aspirin. 
   Recently, ``60 Minutes'' did a show on the high cost of prescription drugs and the need to provide coverage to low-income beneficiaries. National Public Radio has run a series of stories on the rising cost of prescription drugs and government plans to make them available to Medicare beneficiaries. Full-page advertisements and news stories are in our Nation's newspapers, from the Washington Post to the Billings Gazette. We have all seen Flo and her bowling ball. 
   I have a story from the Montana Standard, Butte's local newspaper. The headline reads: ``Montanans Testify for Medicare Drug Coverage.''  
   Greg Loushin's heart breaks every time he watches Montana's elderly and uninsured scrounge for change to buy prescription drugs. Oftentimes, the Butte pharmacist pulls money from his own pocket.  
   Think of that, the local pharmacist pulls money from his own pocket when his own customers do not have adequate funds to pay for their drugs. 
   From the story:  
   Pharmacist helping seniors buy drugs they need from his own money.  
   People help one another out in Butte, MT. Greg's customers are lucky to have him for a pharmacist. But we know in our increasingly interpersonal world, Greg's generosity is a rare exception. It isn't a long-term solution to the problem of escalating costs of prescription drugs; creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare is. 
   Why is it suddenly so important seniors be given a drug benefit under Medicare? Why all the attention? Why the stories? The answer is twofold. 
   First, prescription drug costs have risen dramatically. Overall medical inflation has been slowed in recent years, but the cost of prescription drugs has actually skyrocketed, rising much faster than the average cost of medical care. In 1980, prescription drugs were only 4 percent of total health costs. In the year 2000, they will account for 16 percent of the total, a fourfold increase in 20 years. The increased costs are attributable both to the prices charged for the new, sophisticated drugs that are being developed by pharmaceutical companies, and to increase use of the drugs by our seniors. 
   Today as never before there is increased competition among drug companies to put out new drug therapies for the many ailments that face Americans, young and old. I, for one, do not want to stunt the innovation that has made America the leading architect of medical technology. 
   The second reason the drug benefit is so important is these research efforts are increasingly fruitful. Drugs can now treat illnesses where formally surgery was needed. Drug coverage means healthier individuals, leading to fewer hospitals and less 
   time in the hospital. 
   New York has a plan called EPIC to help low-income seniors with medications that saved an estimated $47 million in hospitalization costs in the recent year, compared with the $41 million it cost to run the program. David Cutler, a Harvard economist, reports elderly disability rates have fallen 15 percent in the last decade largely because of increased use of prescription drugs. 
   Barbara Holter, a Montana Medicare beneficiary, last week wrote me:  
   Senator BAUCUS ..... innovative prescription drugs and biological therapies played an important role in the treatment of arthritis. While not a cure, these new medications can help alleviate the pain, slow the progress of disease, and prevent disability. Unfortunately, 35 percent of Medicare beneficiaries do not have coverage. It is important that Congress take action to expand access to drug coverage.  
   Gone are the days when surgery and mechanical devices alone work to save lives and increase their quality. A heart ailment that may have required an extensive bypass a few years ago can now be treated with a clot-busting medication or a stent. To paraphrase the renowned physician and health care policy expert, Dr. William Schwartz, medicine is changing ``from the mechanical to the molecular.'' 
   Everyone seems to recognize this shift. Everyone, that is except our government. We are 60 days from the year 2000, and we are still trying to run a health care program rooted in the year 1965. 
   Some say we ought to reform Medicare before providing a drug benefit. Senator BILL ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, has indicated his interest in working in a bipartisan fashion to strengthen Medicare in the coming year. I welcome his willingness to do so. Without action, Medicare will go broke in just 15 years, at the very time our social insurance system becomes inundated with the baby boom generation, about 15 years from now. 
   We must act to save Medicare. We ought not let perfection be the enemy of the good. I accept and agree that Medicare must be changed. It is also true the average senior fills 19 prescriptions every year on average. Our seniors don't have the luxury of waiting until the politics are right to get the drugs they need. This is particularly true in rural areas. 
   As this chart indicates, one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage. One-third of seniors in our country have no prescription drug coverage. In rural areas, it is even worse. In rural America, the number increases to nearly half. Seniors are being denied products that can save their lives because of geography. Half of American seniors don't have prescription drug coverage. 
   Part of the problem is we don't have a lot of managed care in rural areas. In fact, we have very little. Managed care will often provide drug coverage to seniors. In many parts of America, particularly rural America, there is no managed care, much less prescription drug coverage for seniors. 
   Recently, my staff spoke to Ardys Olin and her mother Thelma of Billings, MT. Both are beneficiaries of Gold Choice, Montana's only Medicare managed care plan. Ardys is disabled; Thelma is 87. For the time being, they both get prescription drug coverage through Gold Choice, the only managed care program for Medicare in Montana. They are quite pleased with it. 
   Because payment rates are insufficient to sustain managed care in rural America, Gold Choice is soon going to leave Montana, leaving its 2,600 beneficiaries without prescription drug coverage. Where are these people going to go? What are they going to do when Gold Choice pulls out of Montana? 
   Most employers in rural America can't afford to offer prescription drug coverage in their retirement plans. The profit margins are so low in rural America. Unfortunately, many people in rural areas have little or no retirement income beyond their Social Security checks. These people are hurting. Many of the 2,600 Montanans losing prescription drug coverage with the termination of Gold Choice--the only managed Medicare care program in our State--don't have enough money of their own to buy Medigap coverage. Medigap is the insurance plan offered by many companies to fill the gap between what Medicare doesn't pay and what Medicare should pay. 
   Maybe people do not have enough money to buy Medigap insurance. That is why many Americans don't have any prescription drug coverage at all. They simply have to hope they do not become ill and, if they do, that they will be able to afford the cost of the drugs their doctors prescribe. 
   The legislation I am introducing will begin, not totally--but begin to address this problem. We are not creating any new bureaucracies, no new large Government programs. We are simply extending the reach of the Medicaid program to administer drug coverage to our most needy. That is it. This bill provides prescription drug coverage to the elderly whose incomes are 175 percent of the Federal poverty limit. In real terms, that means seniors making up to about $13,500 a year will be provided some prescription drug coverage; $16,800 in the case of couples. 
   This bill impacts seniors who are less able to pay for their prescription drugs.  Consider the following data graciously provided by, and under review at, Health Affairs, the Nation's leading health policy journal. 
   These numbers are from a study supported by the Commonwealth Fund, a national philanthropic organization engaged in independent research on health and social policy issues, and is the product of the able scholarship of Dr. Jan Blustein, professor at the Wagner School of New York University. 
   This chart shows the extent to which low-income seniors with hypertension have prescription drug coverage. Hypertension--that is, high blood pressure--is prevalent among the elderly, occurring in better than 50 percent of persons over age 65. As you can see, seniors with hypertension, with incomes between 100 and 125 percent of poverty, only have prescription drug coverage about 65 percent of the time. Again, seniors whose income is between 100 percent and 125 percent of poverty have prescription drug coverage only about 65 percent of the time. Those between 126 percent and 150 percent of poverty, the next line down, fare even worse, receiving drug coverage only about half the time, 55 percent of the time. 
   Mr. President, 150 percent of poverty is not a lot of money, only about $11,500 a year. There is clearly a need to help these people, and the bill I am introducing today does just that. 
   Let me be clear in stating this legislation is not intended as a permanent solution to the prescription drug problem. It does not provide stop-loss coverage for beneficiaries whose drug bills measure in the thousands of dollars. And because it uses Medicaid, the legislation uses a delivery mechanism that can differ from State to State in the scope of benefits it provides. But it does provide a benefit to those who need it the most. It is not perfect, but it is a start. Most important, it is an idea that has broad-based support from the public and in the Congress. 
   The Medicare Commission, although unable to reach a supermajority on its recommendation to fix the program--that is, Medicare--proposed covering drugs for low-income seniors through Medicare. In a recent poll, 86 percent of Americans favored adding a new Medicare drug benefit to cover part of the cost of the prescription drugs. 
   During the recent debate over tax cuts and the Federal budget, I, with 33 of my colleagues, sent the President a letter urging him to set aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. I am pleased he announced his intentions just last week to do that, to fund a prescription drug benefit. Although creating a prescription drug benefit will be expensive, I think inaction is even more costly. In the words of the former President, Calvin Coolidge, ``We cannot do everything at once but we can do something at once.'' 
   Let's do that something now to help our most vulnerable seniors, help them pay for the drugs that can save their lives.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I express my support for this bill. 
   This bill is not perfect. There are many of us in the Senate who have hoped we could have done more. I have argued that the Research and Development tax credit should be made permanent for many years. Companies plan their research many years in advance, and we don't get the full benefit of the R&D credit by allowing it to expire so frequently. 
   I also support making the AMT exclusion in the bill permanent. Taxpayers should be assured they will receive the full benefits of the personal credits that we enacted with such fanfare just last session. 
   There are other credits in this bill that should be made permanent, such as the Work Opportunities and Welfare to Work tax credits. These credits help compensate companies for hiring those employees that are the hardest to employ and train--those coming off the welfare rolls. 
   But we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We stand here in the waning days of this session, and it appears as though enacting legislation that would make these credits permanent is simply not in the cards. They are expensive, and it is not possible to enact major tax legislation that uses a substantial portion of the surplus unless it is in the context of a comprehensive bill. 
   Above all, we must be fiscally responsible, and protect the surplus for our children and grandchildren. 
   This bill has been reviewed by all Senators and has received unanimous consent to proceed. I hope the Conferees on the bill will work out the differences between the House and Senate quickly, and send us back a bill the President can sign into law. Doing otherwise risks getting nothing at all, and allowing the gap since these important credits lapsed to grow. This would further undermine their effectiveness, and leave thousands of businesses and individuals with tremendous uncertainty about their tax liabilities for this year. 
   We cannot and should not leave this important work undone. We should restore these credits as soon as possible, even if that means leaving the debate about permanence for these credits for another day.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to speak a few minutes about an issue that is very important to me; that is, the condition of school buildings with the federal impact aid, particularly on the school buildings on Indian reservations which are in very dire condition. I hope there is something we can do about it. 
   As you know, there have been many bills introduced in this Congress to try to help school districts and make sure school districts have enough funds for school construction and renovation, modernization, and so forth. But as you also know, when schools try to raise money, basically they do so by bonding, which is paid for by local property taxes. That is essentially the way schools in our country are financed; it is a time-honored approach to school construction. 
   The problem is, in this heated debate, one group of children is continually left out in the cold; that is, students who live on federally owned land, usually on an Indian reservation or a military installation. 
   In my State of Montana, there are about 12,000 children who fall into this category; that is, children who live on a military installation or on an Indian reservation, where there is either none or there is very little private property to support school funding, particularly school construction. These schools are located in areas where much of the local property just cannot be taxed. Why is that? Because it is Federal property. 
   In many cases, the local schools have to educate the children of the families who live on the property, and these are so-called Federal students who could come from military families, from civilian families, or could come from Native American families. Some schools are off reservations, but a lot of the kids live on reservations, and vice versa. This causes a tremendous problem in financing school construction. 
   I believe we have a responsibility. After all, the Federal Government has a trustee responsibility with respect to Indian reservations. More than that, more fundamentally, we have a moral obligation to be sure all children in our country have not only equal access to education but generally have the same accessibility to good schools and relatively up-to-date schools. We are not asking for the Taj Mahal but just basic solid construction. 
   Congress has recognized its responsibility in many respects for these schools through payments authorized under title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is the impact aid provision. These districts are supposed to receive impact aid to compensate school districts for the burden of educating children whose parents do not have to pay local property taxes due to Federal activities; namely, because they live on an installation or an Indian reservation. 
   The bulk of the impact aid payments do help with salaries 
   and utilities and other day-to-day costs of running the schools, but this is the catch: When it comes to replacement or renovation of buildings, these schools still have an additional problem; that is, impact aid cannot begin to pay both the salaries and utility bills and the day-to-day costs, and also pay for the modernization of schools because they just cannot issue the construction bonds to pay for them. 
   There have been several bills introduced in this body dealing with school construction, but none of them deal with this problem; that is, the problem of impact aid on reservations and installations. 
   I am asking for something that is pretty simple. I am asking for a slight increase, from the present $7 million that goes to impact aid school construction to $50 million. That is all. That is not very much money. Mr. President, $7 million is currently spent on impact aid school construction, and I am asking that it be raised to $50 million. Very simple. 
   I can give lots of stories, lots of examples, of just the dire conditions these school districts face. For example, I talked to the superintendent of the Harlem school district. Harlem is in north central Montana. He says his district is so crowded that his students are now using a closet. Guess what was in that closet. In that closet was a snowblower that they hauled out whenever there was a bad snowstorm. 
   So that closet is now a classroom. The snowblower is out in the hall. The students are in the closet. I think this is not right. It is no place to put kids. There is no place to put kids in the closet of a school and put the equipment out in the hallway. In addition, if they try to bring in a portable classroom, then there would be no playground. That is just not right. 
   A few days ago, I received a letter from the principal of the elementary school in Box Elder, MT. His student population is growing very rapidly because there is new housing on the nearby Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. In fact, virtually all of the 300 or so students in his school are Federal students. 
   He has classrooms in portable buildings and in basement rooms with no windows and only one exit door. He tells me he would be afraid to send his own small children to that school, but he has to. This is a disgrace. 
   Last year, the Box Elder school received--get this--$13,000 in Federal impact aid construction funding; $13,000, that is all. 
   That is about the average for schools in this situation. I might say, $13,000 is a pittance. That is not even enough for half of a paint job in the school, let alone for reasonable reconstruction or renovation. 
   I have some photos I would like to display. These photos are representative of not only my State but could represent almost any State in the Nation that has Federal impact aid. This is a picture of an out-of-code electric installation at Babb Elementary School in Browning. There are no fire sprinklers in the basement where the insulation is located. Over in the left corner, we see a socket and wiring dangling. It is uncovered. It is obviously a fire hazard. This is all they can do. 
   Now I have another photograph of a doorway at Babb. This is a doorway in the school. This photo doesn't begin to represent how bad the situation is. Sometimes pictures overstate something. In this case, the photograph understates. 
   The next photo is that of a lunchroom. This is down in the basement of the school. Again, it doesn't look all that bad; but I have been there; it is worse. Then there is a photo taken in the local high school in the same community. There is a leaky ceiling. Things are starting to fall apart. Again, this school can't find the money to pay for it. 
   Imagine for a moment that we in the Senate met in a facility that looked like this or our offices were in rooms such as this or we had electrical equipment so obviously out of code. We would change it. We would do something very quickly because we wouldn't stand for it. 
   What kind of message does this send to children throughout our country--the message that we don't have enough respect for them, enough respect for their parents, enough respect for education to do something about this. We have a huge Federal surplus and the biggest, most wealthy country in the world. Yet we turn our back on a lot of kids in our country. Obviously, it is to their peril but even more to the peril of our country. 
   The bill I will introduce will raise the authorization from $7 million to $50 million--not very much but a first step that is needed. We also make a change in the eligibility rules. Right now schools with populations made up of 70, 80, or even 100 percent Federal students cannot ask for impact aid construction  funds if the percentage of the federally impacted population for the whole district is less than 50 percent. That is, obviously, a standard that is much too high. 
   The bill introduced by me and Senator HAGEL will decrease the district minimum to 25 percent. That will affect a lot of schools in this district. 
   I have a chart that shows how many States would be affected by changing the eligibility standard from 50 percent to 25 percent. You can see that virtually every State in the Nation would be affected, which means every State gets a little bit, if it is enacted at the $43 million increase from the current $7 to $50 million. 
   This is obviously a problem in our State. It is obviously a problem in other heavy Federal impact aid States, such as Nebraska, Senator HAGEL's State. But this isn't a parochial problem. This isn't a partisan problem. This is a national problem. 
   I ask that we step up to the plate, exercise our responsibility and, when we take up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, make this change so that a needy portion of our school population gets a modicum of assistance. Then after that, I hope we can go further.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the history of our Government's effort to promote deregulation and openness in the Japanese telecommunications sector goes back over 20 years. Back to the days when Bob Strauss was the U.S. Trade Representative. 
   The first agreement involved significant changes in the procurement policies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Known as NTT, it was then the government owned, monopoly, domestic telecommunications provider. This agreement has been revised and renewed seven times--most recently earlier this year. 
   There has been a plethora of other bilateral telecommunications agreements with Japan over the years. On  interconnection. On cellular phones. And on international value added networks. 
   We have used Section 301 to pry open the Japanese telecommunications market. We created Section 1377 in the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act to deal with Japanese telecommunications practices. We have had the MOSS talks with Japan in the 1980s. And we have also pursued multilateral efforts through the GATT, the WTO, and the Information Technology Agreement--the ITA. 
   I don't think the United States has negotiated more in one sector with any nation than we have done with Japan over telecommunications. 
   And we have made progress, from virtually zero sales by Americans to Japan in this sector twenty years ago to several billion dollars today. 
   But there is still a long way to go. Japan is the second largest economy in the world. It is at the cutting edge of most high technology. Yet its consumption of telecommunications goods and services fits more closely the model of a second tier economy. 
   It is true that penetration of cellular phones in Japan is among the highest in the world. But, Japan has only 17 million Internet users, while the United States has almost five times as many--80 million users. Japan hosts fewer than two million web sites, while the United States hosts over 30 million. Electronic commerce in Japan is valued at less than one billion dollars, versus at least thirty times as much in the United States. And only 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to the Internet, versus in the United States where 89 percent of schools are connected. 
   Why is this? 
   The answer is simple. Japan maintains a non-competitive regulatory system that prevents market forces from fully operating in the telecommunications sector. American telecom service and equipment providers are still limited in their ability to do business in Japan. 
   But the system also hurts the Japanese consumer. They can't obtain the highest quality telecommunications technology at the lowest price. They are not able to choose from the incredible array of services and products available around the world. And they pay higher prices than they should. 
   Japanese firms also suffer for the same reasons in their telecommunications purchases. They cannot get the best. And they overpay for what they can buy. Many modern services are simply unavailable in Japan. 
   Earlier this month, the United States Government presented Japan with its annual deregulation requests in a number of sectors. If the Japanese government implemented this whole list, they would be on a path leading to economic growth. To better choice and lower prices for its consumers. And to increased efficiency for its industry. 
   I an not naive enough to think that will happen. However, I do know that Japan's adoption of the USTR requests, a so-called ``Telecommunications Big Bang'', would open the telecommunications sector to global competition with all the attendant benefits. 
   Senator GRASSLEY and I are submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It simply stresses the need for this significant regulatory reform in Japan. It calls on USTR vigorously to implement their call for this change. And it sends the message to Japan that the Senate is strongly behind this effort. 
   Such deregulation serves American and International business. It serves the Japanese economy. It serves the Japanese consumer. It serves Japanese industry. And it serves the original and global economy which need so desperately a growing Japan. In the long-run, everyone would win. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution when it is called up.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield? I want to tell the Senator what a gracious suggestion he has made, naming the Coastal Barrier Resources System after Senator John Chafee. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute with respect to legislation with which he has been associated. I hope, therefore, we can bring that bill out quickly--I do not think it is controversial at all--and pass it in this session of this Congress. I thank the Senator. I express my appreciation to the Senator for such a gracious thought, and I will join with him, moving as quickly as we can to make that become law with John's name on it. 
   All of us are at a loss to find the words. We dig down deep to try to ascertain the meaning of John's death. It was so sudden. It happened so quickly, and to such a wonderful, decent, good man. I think basically all of us are going to be remembered to some degree by who we are as people, more than what legislation we passed. We all work together here to pass legislation, but it is really the character of the person that is remembered by family, friends, associates. 
   I can think of no person for whom I presently do have a fonder memory or more respect than John Chafee. There is no man who was more of a good man than John Chafee. His decency, his civility--they do not come any better. They just don't. We are all thinking about John. Words don't come to us--certainly not to this Senator at this moment--but we all know what a good man he was. We cherish those memories very deeply. 
   He was a great Senator.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, twice I have spoken about John Chafee. He was one of the very special people. We just can't stop thinking about him or talking about him. I will not take a great length of time except to say that as I was listening to my colleague from New Hampshire and other colleagues, it really struck me that he was the quintessential, almost perfect public servant. 
   I believe service is the most noble human profession--service to family, service to church, service to community, service to friends, public service. There is no more noble pursuit than service. John Chafee epitomized public service. 
   I wish Americans could have known John Chafee and could have watched him and been with him during the day. If American schoolchildren were to have been with John Chafee, watched John Chafee, I know one thing, most everybody would have wanted to be a Senator. Most everybody would have wanted to emulate John Chafee; he was so good. He taught by example. Somewhat by words, somewhat by telling students what to do, but much more by example. 
   We are all almost in awe of John Chafee because of his example, what he did. He didn't make a big thing about it. He didn't brag about himself. He didn't try to take credit for anything. He just acted according to what he thought was in the country's best interest and in Rhode Island's best interest. It was just by accident that I learned only a couple years ago that he was a highly decorated Korean war hero. There are Senators on this floor sometimes who like to brag about their exploits in the armed services or at least allude to them and hope that somebody asks them more questions about it, pursue it a little more. Not John Chafee. 
   If John Chafee's staff would write a statement or a speech on his behalf and allude to his service in Korea or Guadalcanal as a veteran, he would strike it. He didn't want to brag about anything. He didn't want to brag about all the awards he had been given. He was that kind of guy. To me, they don't get any better. There aren't many cut from that bolt of cloth these days. 
   I wish more people could have seen and watched John as a person, as he was, and a Senator. I know this country would have a much higher regard for public service if they just knew who John Chafee was. 
   This is really John Chafee's day. I hope we all will savor the good thoughts and the wonderful memories of John, this day and in future days.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when we go to H.R. 434, I am going to introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution encouraging the U.S. Government to pursue its bilateral measures with Japan and urge the United States to urge  Japan to go further to open up telecommunications markets, particularly its Internet services, and so forth. I will have a lot more to say at the appropriate time. I believe strongly that we, as a country, have to go further and, more importantly, Japan has to go a lot further in opening up its market. It would be in the best interest of Japanese consumers, if it were to do so, and it would surely be in the best interest of peoples all around the world. At the appropriate time, I will speak more at length.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, for myself, Senator CAMPBELL, and Senator DASCHLE. This bill will address one of our nation's most overlooked environmental problems: the thousands of abandoned mines that pour pollution into rivers and streams throughout the west. 
   Since 1972, when we enacted the Clean Water Act, our nation has made a lot of progress improving water quality. Generally speaking, our water is cleaner. The Potomac doesn't stink. The Cuyuhoga doesn't burst into flame. EPA estimates that about 1/3 more of our rivers are fishable and swimmable than 20 years ago. 
   But we still face serious water pollution problems. 
   One of the most serious, in the west, is pollution from abandoned mines. 
   Let me provide some background. 
   The settlement of the mountain west was driven, in large part, by mining. Take my home state of Montana. At the center of Helena is Last Chance Gulch, where gold was discovered in 1864. Butte was called the ``Richest Hill on Earth, ``because of it's huge veins of copper. Our state's motto is ``Oro y Plata''--gold and silver. The ASARCO smelter in East Helena is one of the largest and most efficient in the world. 
   Mining has long been critical to our development. It's created jobs. It's part of our culture. Of our community. 
   But mining, like many other economic activities, can have severe environmental consequences. Especially the way it was conducted years ago, before the development of sophisticated environmental laws and regulations. 
   I am reminded of the words of the Montana writer, A.B. Guthrie.  
   Much of the exploitation, much of unthinking damage, was done in ..... a spirit characteristic of pioneer America. Growth was the way of life. It was the nature of things. ..... The end was not yet. The end never would be. That's what we thought. We know better now.  
   One reason that we know better now is that we've seen the effect of the abandoned hardrock mines that dot the landscape of the mountain west. They once were active mines, in many cases, long ago. Now they're an abandoned collection of tailings, shafts, and adits. 
   Even in generally arid areas, these mines release acid wastes. They leach mercury, arsenic, copper, and other heavy metals. They load sediments into nearby waters. They poison drinking water. They contaminate fish, making them unfit to eat. They threaten public health and destroy rivers and streams. 
   According to the Western Governors Association:  
   Abandoned and inactive mines are responsible for many of the greatest threats and impairments to water quality throughout the United States. Thousands of stream miles are severely impacted by drainage and runoff from these mines, often for which a responsible party is unidentifiable or not economically viable. At least 400,000 abandoned or inactive mine sites occur in the west.  
   This map shows the scope of the problem. 
   The small dots indicate individual sites. Light shading indicates that there are more than 100 sites. Orange, between 200 and 300. Red, more than 300 sites. 
   As you can see, There are hundreds of sites in many western states--Montana, Idaho, California, Utah. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and South Dakota. 
   And that's not all. Michigan. The Ohio Valley. The Appalachains. All across the country. 
   In Montana, there are approximately 6,000 abandoned hardrock mines. State officials already have identified 245 that are within 100 feet of a stream. In many cases, these mines are known to be polluting downstream waters. 
   Most of the sites are concentrated around Helena. But there are sites throughout western Montana, in 24 of our 56 counties. All the way from Lincoln County, in Northwest Montana, to Park County, in South Central Montana. 
   Let me show you an example. 
   This is an abandoned hardrock mine site near Rimini, about 15 miles west of Helena. It's in the Ten Mile Creek watershed, which serves as the Helena drinking supply. As you can see, the water is actually orange. 
   Clearly, abandoned hardrock mines pose a big problem. 
   So why isn't somebody doing something about it? 
   As is often the case, this simple question requires a pretty complicated answer. 
   In the first place, it may be impossible to track down the person who created the problem. The original mine operator may long gone. 
   In other cases, the ownership patterns are a complex mix of federal, state, and private land; and of surface, mineral, and water rights. It is not uncommon for dozens of parties to have had some connection to a mining site over the years. So it's difficult to establish legal responsibility for a private party to clean up the site.  
   There's another alternative. A state, tribe, or local government agency may want to step in and clean the site up themselves. As the Western Governors Association has put it:  
   The western states have found that there would be a high degree of interest and willingness on the part of federal, state and local agencies ..... to work together toward solutions to the multi-faceted problems commonly found on inactive mined lands.  
   But there's a hitch. A few years ago, a federal court of appeals held that, under the Clean Water Act, one of these ``good samaritans'' is treated exactly the same as the operator of an working mine. That is, someone who has no responsibility for a site, but nevertheless wants to step in and make progress in cleaning up the site, must get a permit that complies with all of the effluent guidelines and other requirements of the Clean Water Act. 
   Many states, tribes, and local government good samaritans simply can't afford to clean up a site to full Clean Water Act standards. 
   So, facing the legal consequences if they fall short, potential good samaritans refrain from attempting to address water pollution problems at all. 
   Let me tell you about the Alta mine, outside Corbin, Montana. That's about 15 miles South of Helena. 
   The mine is an important part of Montana's heritage. Ore was discovered in there 1869. 
   During the late 1800s, 450 miners were extracting more than 150 tons of ore each day, generating a total of $32 million worth of gold, silver, lead, and zinc. That's the equivalent of about $1 billion in today's dollars. 
   The main portion of the mine closed in 1896. This century, mining and remining continued sporadically, under a variety of different operators. The mine was completely abandoned in the late 1950s. 
   I visited the site a few weeks ago, with my friend Vick Anderson, who runs the Montana mine cleanup program. 
   This is a photograph of the mine shaft. It cuts down to the old underground workings, 650 feet below. The shaft serves as a collection point for groundwater. 
   In the picture, you can see the toxic, acid water that seeps from the shaft and eventually drains into Corbin Creek. 
   Up until this point, Corbin Creek runs clear and clean. It's a high-quality trout stream. But, after the runoff from the Alta mine, the water is contaminated with arsenic, antimony, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, and zinc. 
   There's a distinct sulphuric odor. In some places, the water looks orange, like the picture I showed of the mine near Rimini. 
   This contamination affects not only Corbin Creek, but also Spring Creek and Prickly Pear Creek. That's about 7 miles of contamination. In the town of Corbin itself, the pollution is so bad that the State of Montana was forced to close groundwater wells and contstruct a $300,000 water supply project to serve 11 homes. 
   Now let me tell you what you can't see in the picture of the Alta mine. 
   All around the mine shaft, the State of Montana is conducting reclamation work. Removing structures. Closing adits. Removing or covering contaminated soil. 
   The state would also like to do something about the water pollution. 
   For example, they could divert runoff through a channel, and then construct wetlands to filter the arsenic, iron, lead, mercury, and other pollutants. This would clean the water up, significantly. 
   The engineers say that it will work. 
   But the lawyers say it won't. 
   They say that, by diverting the water, the state would become liable under the Clean Water Act. It would have to get a permit. And the permit would require permanent treatment that is prohibitively expensive. 
   Faced with that possibility, there is only one practical thing for the state to do. Nothing. Leave the water pollution alone. 
   And that's exactly what is happening. As we speak, the toxic water continues to flow directly into Corbin Creek. 
   This is not an isolated example. According to the Western Governors Association and others, the same thing is happening all across the west. 
   As you can see, the current system creates a disincentive. It prevents well-intentioned state and local governments from stepping in and conducting voluntary cleanups. 
   As a result, the cleanups don't occur and the pollution keeps flowing. 
   That's the problem that our bill will fix. 
   The title of this bill, the ``Good Samaritan Mine Remediation Waste bill'' says it all. 
   The state, tribal, and local government agencies that we refer to as ``good samaritans'' are not trying to make money. They're not trying to skirt the law. They're trying to do good--in this case, to improve water quality. 
   The basic objective of this bill is to allow that. To allow states, tribes and local governments to be good samaritans. 
   In a nutshell, the bill will allow state, local, and tribal governments to clean up an abandoned mines under a special permit, tailored to the conditions of the site. 
   They apply for a good samaritan permit from EPA. The application must include a detailed plan describing the cleanup actions that will be taken to improve water quality. 
   EPA reviews the plan and takes comments from the local community. EPA can approve the application if it determines that the plan will result in an improvement in water quality to the greatest extent practical, given the resources and cleanup technologies available to the Good Samaritan. 
   Once a permit is approved, the good samaritan can proceed with the cleanup. EPA will monitor progress and conduct periodic reviews. When the cleanup is finished, the permit is terminated and the Good Samaritan is not held responsible for any future discharges from the site. 
   That's the basic framework.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the long and distinguished career of Judge John L. Peterson. After serving in the District Bankruptcy Court for 35 years, Jack is retiring. As a native of Butte, MT, Jack has become a fixture in the Montana court system. 
   His tenure on the bench has earned him the distinction as ``Dean'' of bankruptcy judges in this century. Jack is a no-nonsense type of judge, just ask any lawyer that has ever come before Judge Peterson, they had to learn that quickly. He has saved bankruptcy clients and lawyers thousands of dollars by pioneering video trials. He has proved over and over that he is innovative and effective. As the longest serving bankruptcy judge in the United States his experience and wisdom will be sorely missed.. 
   Although his absence will leave a void in the courts, the handball courts and golf courses in Butte will get to see a lot more of him. Jack's retirement will also allow him to spend some welcome time with his wife, Jean, his three children and four grandchildren. 
   On behalf of myself and the people of Montana who have benefited from Judge Peterson's wisdom and service over the last 35 years, I extend my thanks and warmest wishes for a long and happy retirement.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise with deep and heavy sadness to mourn the passing of a great statesman, my dear friend, JOHN CHAFEE, from Rhode Island. 
   There will be a lot of eulogies on the floor over the next several days. For the moment, I want to say a few words about a very great man, a very close friend, someone who I think is one of the best Members of the Senate in many, many years. 
   First, a little bit of history about JOHN CHAFEE. He was born to one of the most prominent New England families. He could have coasted. He could have gone into business. He could have gone into law. No, he did not do that. What did he do? He chose service to his people. It was an extraordinary life of service. 
   JOHN was a marine. JOHN fought in the historic battle at Guadalcanal. A few years later, he reenlisted and led troops in combat in Korea. 
   On a lighter note, as far as I know, Senator CHAFEE was the only Member of the Senate who was also a member of the American College Wrestling Hall of Fame. Move over, Jesse Ventura. We have a wrestler in the Hall of Fame. 
   JOHN, after serving in the armed services, later turned to public service. He was a Governor of Rhode Island. He was a Secretary of the Navy. Since 1976, he was a Member of the Senate. 
   When I first joined the Senate about 20 years ago, the last thing in the world I believed was over a period of time he and I would become very close friends. We were sitting as junior Members, very far away from each other, on the Finance Committee and also on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am from Montana. JOHN is from Rhode Island. In Montana, we even have ranches the size of the State of Rhode Island. We were from very different States with different constituencies. Nevertheless, it was a circumstance of seniority that brought us together. I was very privileged to work with JOHN. We exchanged chairmanships and ranking memberships on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We developed a very close relationship. 
   He was one of the best persons, in my judgment, in the Senate. On the Finance Committee, he worked to balance the budget. He put fiscal austerity, on behalf of future generations, ahead of ideology. He worked for a system of free trade. Most important, JOHN spoke for those people in the shadows--the poor, the elderly, and children. Especially children with special needs, whether it was Medicaid or welfare reform, JOHN was a very strong advocate. In fact, he was a stronger advocate by far than most Members of the Senate. 
   On the Environment and Public Works Committee, which he chaired, he did so in the great tradition of other New England Senators: Ed Muskie, Bob Stafford and George Mitchell. Tremendous tradition on that committee. 
   His accomplishments are legion. We breathe cleaner air because of JOHN CHAFEE. Because of his diligent work on the Clean Water Act, we drink cleaner water because of JOHN CHAFEE. We have a rich legacy, and JOHN CHAFEE left that legacy to our children and grandchildren. In addition, he vigorously pushed through the Oil Pollution Act in the wake of the Valdez tragedy; the Safe Drinking Water Act; Endangered Species Act; the National Wildlife Refuge System is in place because of Muskie, Stafford, and, particularly, JOHN CHAFEE; the Coastal Barrier 
   Resources System--all bear JOHN's mark. 
   Personally, I will remember JOHN CHAFEE as a decent, civil, courteous, commonsense gentleman. His issues and the legislation he worked for were very important. But it is the man who means the most to me and is remembered most by me. He reminds me of my father. He never raised his voice, never lost his temper, was always calm, always cool, often with a little twinkle in his eye, a sense of humor. He had respect for life. He knew what was important and not important. He kept his eye on the ball and wouldn't let conversations drift to gossip or extraneous matters that didn't matter; they prevented Members from accomplishing the objective. 
   Uncommon common sense. JOHN CHAFEE had a sixth sense for common sense. He knew the basic, balanced, right thing to do. 
   Senator SPECTER mentioned the organizations he put together, the moderates working on health care. That is only one of the many examples of JOHN CHAFEE trying to get something accomplished for the good of America. 
   Unquestioned integrity. We say around here that a man's word is his bond. It is true. We always strive toward it because we know it is necessary, not only to get legislation passed but it is one of the most important things in life. We knew when JOHN said something it was true. No one ever questioned what JOHN said. 
   My father's name was JOHN. Maybe that is part of it. The two of them remind me so much of each other. Both were veterans and knew the importance of America--maybe because they were veterans. JOHN knew from fighting at Guadalcanal, fighting in Korea, fighting for American virtues, American values and what is right in America. Maybe that is what enabled him to keep his perspective and calm. 
   It has been mentioned he is a family man. I saw it many times. Not too many days ago I was on the floor with JOHN and he said: Gee, I promised Ginny I would be home by 2 o'clock today. His legs were bothering him. Gee, I want to get this bill passed; I will vote on this. 
   He was torn for the right reasons, torn between family and duty. But he gave honor to both because they were so important to JOHN. 
   I, too, was stunned when I learned of JOHN's death last night. We will miss him terribly. He was a most wonderful man. His memory will be embedded strongly in all of us. It is a memory I know I will cherish forever and ever. I will always see JOHN's twinkle, his smile, his earnest sense of trying to do the right thing. 
   On behalf of my wife, Wanda, and my staff, our deepest sympathy and condolences go to Ginny and the family, as well as members of JOHN's staff, some of whom are on the floor. JOHN was very close to his staff. It is a wonderful, tight knit family. Our deepest condolences go out to all of them.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the establishment of the sister-state relationship between my home state of Montana and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. 
   The establishment of this sisterhood marks a successful conclusion to many years of building mutual cooperation, trust and friendship, as well as a bright beginning of a continued strong relationship between our countries. 
   I would like to commend Governor Marc Racicot of the State of Montana for his continued efforts to bring new opportunities to the state through education, business relations and cultural exchanges. I would also like to thank the People's Republic of China and Governor Li Zhaozhuo for linking Guangxi Province to Montana. The richness of culture, citizens, history, and boundless environmental beauty make our state and your province a perfect match. 
   Montana and Guangxi have worked a long time in building this relationship. In fact, a high level delegation from Guangxi Province joined the first Mansfield Pacific Retreat on ``Trade and Agriculture,'' held in Bigfork, Montana, in May 1996. 
   The idea of establishing friendly exchange relationships between American states and cities and Chinese provinces and cities goes back to the late 1970s when China, as a country, began to ``open up to the outside.'' These sister relationships have proved to be very helpful in establishing cultural and grassroots relations. A good example is the product relationship between the city of Seattle and Chongqing in Sichuan Province. 
   The establishment of Montana's sister ties with Guangxi Province in South China fits within this tradition of promoting people to people communication. Such a relationship is especially relevant to Montana because of the life, work, and legacy of Mike Mansfield. He is Montana's ``favorite son'' who has also made a name known for himself in China. His promotion of sister relationships with Asia began during his tenure as American Ambassador to Japan. He proposed and helped to establish Montana's sister relationship with Kumamoto Prefecture. He also established the University of Montana's sister relations with Toyo University in Tokyo and Kumamoto University in Kumamoto City. 
   Although Senator Mansfield is better known for his promotion of mutual understanding with Japan, his impact on American Chinese relations is also significant. His interest in East Asia began when he served in the U.S. Marines soon after World War I and visited the American Garrison then in the city of Tianjin. 
   Senator Mansfield continued his work in the Far East as a Congressman from Montana. He visited China at the request of President Roosevelt to report back with advice on American policy following the defeat of Japan in the Pacific War. He is also credited with opening relations with China in the early 1970s and he was the first American Senator to visit China, soon after President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. The current ties between Montana and Guangxi are a fitting expression of the value of people to people communication between America and China. They  are also a fitting tribute to the legacy of Senator Mansfield. 
   Finally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to visit Guangxi's beautiful city of Guilin last summer during President Clinton's visit to China. I was impressed by the great efforts the Guangxi's citizens have taken to ensure that their children and generations to come will continue to enjoy the natural wonders and beauty of their province. We in Montana also take such pride in our state's natural treasures--our mountains, our lakes and our wildlife. 
   I am very proud of the establishment of Montana and Guangxi's sisterhood. This is just the beginning. As we enter the new Millennium, let us strive to build and strengthen our sisterhood relationship as a model for cooperation and understanding.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Caleb Shields, retired Chairman and current Councilman of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. Caleb is retiring from his elected position with the Tribe, after twenty-four years of elected service. For those of you who don't know Caleb, I am sorry that you did not have an opportunity to meet this remarkable man during his many visits to discuss the myriad of issues facing Native American people. He has a strength of character and honor about him that you could not help but recognize and admire instantly when you met him. 
   Caleb's tenure of twenty-four years on the Board is truly a testament to his leadership and his character. As we all know, very few politicians can have a career that spans twenty-four years and even fewer can do it with the grace and dedication that Caleb has. It has been an honor to work with Caleb on the many issues that we have worked on together. His commitment and dedication to improve the lives of not only the Native Americans on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, but the lives of Native Americans throughout the Nation, are an inspiration to me. He has worked tirelessly to improve the level of funding for Indian health care programs and Native American education programs. He has stood in the Halls of Congress, often in the face of severe opposition, defending the governmental and sovereign rights of tribes. He has stood up to the federal government when the federal government has failed in its obligation to the tribes of this country. Significantly, he did all of this without ever making an enemy and without ever treating any person with disrespect. We can all stand to learn something from this man who while he had many battles, he never made any enemies. 
   I will miss my friend's visits to Washington, but I will mostly miss his advice on the Native American issues. Native American Country is losing a great leader, but I am sure that the basketball teams in Poplar are regaining a loyal fan. I understand that Caleb hopes to write a book about the history of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes from treaty time to modern time. I wish him well in his endeavor and look forward to reading his book.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act, a bill that I have introduced along with my colleagues Senators BOND, BREAUX, LINCOLN, and MCCAIN. 
   As you know, Mr. President, in 1997 Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. CHIP is a joint Federal-State program, designed to ensure that children of low-income working families have access to health insurance. I'm proud to have worked on the Senate Finance Committee to establish CHIP, and I remain committed to its guiding principle: that all children should have access to the medical care they need to stay healthy and strong. 
   In fact, just 13 days ago, the Montana CHIP program went into effect. So as I speak, children in my state are already benefitting from this program. 
   But while CHIP is important, it is not without imperfections. Most notably, States are not allowed to extend CHIP funds to low-income, pregnant adult women. This just doesn't make sense. If pregnant women go uninsured, they are far less likely to receive prenatal care. And if they don't receive prenatal care, their babies face a much higher risk of having health problems, from premature birth to birth defects. We should make sure that these babies are healthy and strong from the very start, by allowing states to offer health insurance to low-income pregnant women under CHIP. 
   A second problem with CHIP is that, just like the Medicaid program, we've had a hard time getting the word out about it. Right now, there are 358,000 pregnant woman and fully 3 million children who are eligible for Medicaid, but are not enrolled in the program. The same holds true with CHIP: across the United States, low-income, uninsured kids cannot benefit from the program, because they aren't enrolled. 
   Mr. President, our bill is aimed at solving these problems, and making CHIP an even stronger, more effective program. First, it would give States the freedom to extend CHIP funds to low-income, pregnant mothers above the age of 19. This is a critical steps toward empowering our States to provide health care to those who need it most, when they need it most. As many as 45,000 pregnant women could benefit from this change every year--and bare in mind, that means that 45,000 babies could benefit as well. 
   And let me add, Mr. President, that this does not create a new Federal mandate. To the contrary, this provision would only increase the freedom of the States to direct these Federal health care resources as they see fit. 
   Second, our bill would assist States in reaching out to their uninsured citizens. When Congress passed the welfare reform bill in 1996, we also created a $500 million fund that States could use to let uninsured folks know if they were eligible for Medicaid. The problem is, most of this money has gone unused. And in just a short while, most states will lose their 3-year window of opportunity to use these funds. Our bill will eliminate this 3-year deadline, to allow continued access to these funds. It will also allow states to use the funds to reach out to both Medicaid and CHIP-eligible women and children. By making this change, we can help ensure that CHIP and Medicaid function as they are supposed to--and that the mothers and children who need health insurance coverage will get it. 
    Mr. President, most of my colleagues, liberal and conservative alike, agree that CHIP is a step in the right direction toward solving the growing problem of the uninsured. Let's act now to make CHIP even stronger.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment and thank my good friend from Nebraska for his statement on this Agriculture conference report. 
   Nebraska is an agricultural State. As my colleague from Montana, the Presiding Officer, knows, Montana is also an agricultural State. I see on the floor the chairman, my good friend from Mississippi. Mississippi is also an agricultural State. Every State is an agricultural State--some more than others, of course. 
   But I must say about the statement the Senator made--in most respects I agree with him--it was a good one. 
   Essentially it comes down to this. A lot of farmers and ranchers are suffering very dire economic consequences because of low prices in the main but also because of bad weather, because of disaster, droughts, or in many cases floods. The hurricane, for example, that came up the east coast not too long ago has devastated a lot of eastern American farmers. Those States are not part of the farm program but, nevertheless, have heavy agricultural segments in their economy and have been damaged significantly. We have a conference report in front of us which provides about $8.7 billion in emergency aid. Most of that goes to Midwest farmers, western farmers, and not enough goes to the northeastern farmers. That is regrettable. 
   There is not enough in this conference report that takes care of Eastern and Northeastern agriculture. There should be. I hope we can figure out a way to provide for those in agriculture in the Eastern and Northeastern parts of the United States because they are not sufficiently provided for in this bill. 
   Nevertheless, for most of America, this bill does help. It just helps. It does not do much more, but it helps relieve a lot of the pain that farmers--when I say farmers, I mean grain producers and livestock producers--are facing. 
   It is an old story. It has not changed. Agriculture is in a special situation; namely, it suffers the vagaries of weather; it suffers the vagaries of the market price. Most businesses today do  not have that to worry about. Most businesses today can control the prices they pay for their products. To some degree, they can control the prices for which they sell their products. There is a lot more stability in most other industries compared to agriculture. 
   Because of the instability in agriculture, again because farmers and ranchers have virtually no control over the price they get for their products and because the costs they pay for all of their supplies and implements keep rising--and they have virtually no say about that--agriculture is getting squeezed more and more each year. That is the problem, particularly when there is a natural disaster on top of it. 
   This Senate has not done a very good job in addressing this problem. There are a lot of fancy speeches about we have to do this and we have to do that. I have made some of them. All Senators in this Chamber at the present time have made some of them. I am not blaming us all, but I am giving us all a little 
   bit of a reminder that we have not followed up our speeches enough with action. It is hard. It is very hard to know what the solutions should be, but we still have not found the solutions. We are elected to find the solutions. That is why we run for these jobs, and that is theoretically why people elect us. They think we are going to do something about some of the problems our people face. 
   Why haven't we done more? I submit in large part because this place is so partisan. It has become very partisan in the last several years. I am not going to stand here and blame one side or the other. I am going to say it is a fact. Because it is so partisan, there is very little trust, and because there is very little trust not much gets accomplished. There is not much trust between the majority party and the White House. When that happens, not much gets accomplished. 
   Our Founding Fathers set up a form of government of divided powers. We are not a parliamentary form of government. We are a divided government. We have the executive branch and the legislative branch, the two Houses of Congress, and people have to get along if we are to get something accomplished; people have to work together if we are going to get something accomplished. 
   Too often, people in the House and the Senate, and probably the executive branch as well, run to the newspapers, they run to the press back home and they make all these high-sounding statements to make themselves look good and the other side to look bad. They are trying to claim credit for doing the good things and basically saying the other guys are doing the bad things. 
   That is where we are. There is not a person listening to my remarks who does not disagree with that. That is exactly where we are. 
   The question is, How do we get out of this? How do we start to regain some lost trust? How do we begin to regain, in some sense--some are going to dispute a little of this--those times in the older days when there was a little more cooperation? How are we going to do that? 
   Basically, it takes leadership. It takes leadership by Senators; it takes leadership by the leadership. It means standing above matters a little bit, standing back and getting a perspective, remembering why we are here, remembering what really counts. And what really counts is serving our people without a lot of fanfare rather than trying to make a lot of big fancy statements. 
   I am reminded of a former Senator from Montana, Mike Mansfield. Mike Mansfield, who was majority leader for 17 years --he was leader longer than any other Senator has ever been leader in this body--was the kind of person--and that is probably why he was leader for so long--who basically worked to get things done but did not crow about it and did not try to take a lot of credit for it. He was a guy who wanted to get things done to serve the people and to serve the right way, not play politics, not play partisan politics. In fact, there is a new book coming out about Mike Mansfield. If you page through it, you can get a sense of what he was about, and we can take a lesson from it. 
   I am going to list a couple of things I know we have to do in the hope that--knowing that most agree we have to do these things--we somehow get together and start doing something about them. 
   One is to get this conference report adopted. It is going to help. It is not going to solve all the problems, but it is going to help. As I mentioned, it does not do enough for the Northeastern United States or Eastern United States. I very much hope we can find the time and way to do that. 
   In addition, we do need to address the longer term; that is, some kind of a safety net. There has been a lot of debate--most of it has been ideological--over Freedom to Farm. It is basically an ideological debate. Most farmers and ranchers do not give two hoots about ideology. Most farmers and ranchers just want some basic program, structure, or something that addresses the bottom so there is some kind of a safety net. 
   We are not talking about a handout. Nobody is talking about a handout. We are not talking about some solution where farmers are given an absolute guarantee they are going to make money or absolute guarantee they are going to make a profit. But we know because of weather conditions--sometimes it rains too much, sometimes not enough, sometimes there are floods, sometimes droughts, sometimes the market falls to the bottom--we need a floor to basically prevent people from going out of business--not to make a profit but prevent them from going out of business because we know how important agriculture is to our country. 
   Let's get over the ideology of Freedom to Farm, the ``freedom to fail.'' Those are nice sounding words. All of us have heard them hundreds of times. I say let's forget the words and figure out a way to design a safety net. It is not going to happen this year because there is not enough time. I ask us all, when we are home during the recess, to be thinking about this and thinking about a way to get a square peg in a square hole or a round peg in a round hole and find a solution. I guarantee, the best politics is really the best policy; that is, if we enact something that makes sense, then all the Republicans and all the Democrats can say: Yes, we did something good. And the people at home are going to be very happy for that. They care much more about that than who is blaming whom for not getting the job done. 
   I do not know why I have to say that. It is so obvious. I guess I say it because it is still not done. 
   We, obviously, have to address crop insurance. We want a Crop Insurance Program essentially so farmers and ranchers can make their own decisions and know how much they should be insured. We want a program that works and covers a lot more than the current program does. 
   As you well know, Mr. President, because you and I have spent a lot of time on these issues, we have to have a much better international trade regime. American farmers and ranchers are being taken to the cleaners. They are being taken to the cleaners compared with farmers and ranchers worldwide. 
   One example is this beef hormone matter. The Europeans for 12 years have said they are not going to take a single ounce of American beef. Why? Because they say our feed lots with growth hormones cause disease and people who eat American beef--Americans eat it all the time and other people do, too--has an adverse health effect on European consumers. It is a totally bogus issue, totally. Europeans know it; we know it. But for 12 years, they still have not taken any beef. 
   What do we do? We bring an action before the World Trade Organization. What happens? The World Trade Organization agrees. They sent it to an international scientific panel which 
   concluded the Americans are right and the Europeans are wrong. They sent it to a second scientific panel. It came to the same conclusion. All the scientific panels came to the same conclusion. Europe still says no. 
   The WTO says that we have a right, as Americans, to impose tariffs on European products, on the value of the beef that is not going into Europe, so we do. Europeans say: Fine, we will just pay; we still won't import any beef. That is one of many examples where we are getting stiffed because there is not a way, there is not leverage, there is not a regime for us to stand up for what is right for American farmers.  
   And take the state trading enterprises, the Canadian Wheat Board, the Australian Wheat Board. We still have not solved that problem. 
   We will face a huge problem, too, in the coming years with respect to Europe. Europeans are getting on their high horse about genetically modified organisms. It is going to be a huge problem with Europe. To make matters even worse, Europe is starting to feel its oats. I think it is kind of upset with the United States because they see the United States as this big country. I think the war in Yugoslavia has exacerbated things a little bit because the European defense establishment did not provide the sophisticated materiel that was needed there. So now they want to build up their defense establishment. It is wrapped up in an awful lot of issues. 
   And it is OK for Americans to criticize the Europeans for their failure to be straight and have a level agricultural playing field. I might add, for example, their export subsidies are out of this world. European export subsidies are about 60 times American export subsidies for agriculture--60 times. Our EEP is about $300 million, $200 million--I do not think it is ever used--whereas their export subsidies are gargantuan. 
   Do you think Europeans, out of the goodness of their heart, are going to lower their export subsidies? No way. No way. We know that no country altruistically, out of the goodness of its heart, is going to lower their trade barriers. The only way to lower trade barriers is when there is a little leverage. So we have to find leverage in the usual way. 
   What I am saying is we have a huge challenge ahead of us; that is, to try to figure out--hopefully, in a noncombative way --how to deal with Europe. There are many issues with Europe, and they are just getting more and more complicated--whether it is Airbus or whether it is air pollution rules. They will not take our planes now because they say our airplanes pollute Europe. They are just huge issues. Basically, they are economic issues. And the economic issues are also very heavily agricultural. 
   We have to figure out a way. It takes leadership from the President. It takes some cool-mindedness in the House and the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, to try to figure out some way to crack this nut. It is going to be a very difficult nut to crack, but it has to be if it is going to help our farmers because right now our farmers are being taken advantage of by the Europeans--pure and simple. Nobody disputes that. 
   It is up to us to try to figure out a way to solve that one. I know that the more we criticize Europe, the more it makes us feel good, but it probably causes Europeans to dig their heels in a little more, and I do not know how much it will get the problem solved. We have to find leverage and some commonsense way to go about it and deal with this issue. 
   The leverage I suggest is the WTO ``trigger,'' as I call it, the export subsidy trigger. This legislation I have introduced essentially provides that if the Europeans do not reduce their agricultural subsidies by 50 percent in a couple years, then the United States is directed to spend EEP dollars in a like amount. If they do not eliminate them in another year, then the United States is directed to spend several billion dollars in EEP directed and targeted exactly at European producers, the European countries. So that is one bit of leverage. 
   I am also going to introduce legislation soon. It is agricultural surge legislation, to prevent farmers from suffering so much from import surges from other countries to the United States. We need action such as that and then to sit down calmly and coolly to talk with the Europeans, talk with the Chinese and the Japanese and the Canadians, to find a solution. 
   There are a lot of other things we need to do to help our farmers. Many have talked about the concentration of the beef packing industry, and they are right; there is way too much concentration of the beef packing industry, which is hurting our producers. There is labeling in this bill that helps. 
   There is one big omission. Seventy Senators voted to end the unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. The conferees disregarded the views of 70 Senators. They took that out. I do not know why. It does not make any sense why the conferees took that out of this conference report, particularly when 70 Senators, on a bipartisan basis, said, hey, we should not have unilateral sanctions on medicine and food; it should not be there. I wish they had not done that. Clearly, we have to find a way to get that passed. 
   I will stop here, Mr. President, because I see a lot of other Senators on the floor who wish to speak. But I strongly urge a heavy vote for this conference report and in a deeper sense--because obviously it is going to pass--calling upon us to back off from the partisanship. Let's start to think as men and women, as people. We are supposed to be educated. We are supposed to be smart. We are supposed to be leaders in a certain sense. Let's do it. Let's act as grownups, adults, problem solvers. That is all I am asking. It is not a lot. Over the recess, I hope we think a little bit about that, so when we come back next year, we can start to solve some problems.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on one other matter, although I told the Senator from Mississippi I would not address this subject, I am going to do so very briefly. That is the other matter before the Senate today, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   This is a no-brainer. It is an absolute no-brainer. It makes no sense, no sense whatsoever, for the Senate to disregard the views of the President of the United States to bring up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty knowing it is going to fail. It makes no sense. It is irresponsible. It is tragic. I cannot believe the Senate will let that happen. I cannot believe it because of the obvious signal it is going to send around the world. 
   What is that signal? The signal is: The United States is abrogating its leadership. The United States is sticking its tail between its legs and running away. It is leaving the scene. It is not being a leader. I cannot believe the Senate will allow that treaty to come up knowing it is going to be a negative vote. 
   I do not know what planet I am on--Mars, Pluto, Jupiter--to think of what the Senate could possibly do today. It is outrageous. 
   While I am on that point, let me speak toward bipartisanship just briefly. It used to be when the President of the United States had a major foreign policy request of the Congress, politics would stop at the water's edge. Politics would stop because it would be such an important national issue, and the Congress--Republicans and Democrats--would work together on major foreign policy issues. 
   There is plenty of opportunity for politics in the United States. There is plenty of opportunity--too much. It is highly irresponsible for the Senate to stick its thumb in the eye of the President of the United States when the President of the United States requests that there not be a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, whatever his reasons might be, and say: We don't care what you think, Mr. President; we're going to vote anyway because we want to knock this thing down. 
   I just cannot believe it. It is just beyond belief. 
   I very much hope that later on today and in future days, Senators will think more calmly about this, exercise a little prudence, and do what Senators are elected to do; that is, be responsible and do what is right, not what is political. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Agriculture Import Surge Relief Act of 1999. 
   This year's harvest is nearly over in Montana and the rest of the country. But instead of breathing a sigh of relief after a summer of hard work, many of our farmers are holding their breath, wondering whether they will even be able to farm next year. With prices at a 50-year low, global oversupply and unpredictable surges in imports, our rural communities continue to face crisis. 
   We in the Senate have been working hard to address this triad of problems. Today, I would like to offer a partial solution to the trade angle--the Agriculture Import Surge Relief Act. This Act addresses surges in agricultural imports. 
   For a variety of reasons, including overcapacity overseas, misaligned exchanges rates, and low international commodity prices, we may find a sudden, sharp, and unpredictable increase in import levels of particular agricultural product. This type of sudden rise in import levels damage the heart of our economy and our farm communities. 
   We must do a better job of monitoring these surges so that we see them as soon as they start. And we must do a better and faster job of responding to these surges to provide relief to our producers before they go out of business. 
   The Agriculture Import Surge Relief Act targets these goals by making several critical improvements in Section 201 of U.S. trade law. 
   Section 201 is the so-called ``safeguard'' provision that is designed to prevent serious disruption of our domestic industry because of imports. It is also the very provision that was used by U.S. lamb producers earlier this year to find relief from a surge in lamb imports from Australia and New Zealand. I am pleased that U.S. lamb producers prevailed; but it cost them dearly--in both time and money. Unlike other industries, agriculture is extraordinarily time sensitive. A year-long case can find many producers driven out of business before it ends. 
   It is also important to note that Section 201 is not a protectionist measure. It is a short-term mechanism used to get an ``injured'' American industry back on its feet and competing again. I consider Section 201 as a ``breathing room'' provision. That is, it gives temporary relief to a domestic industry by providing for a short-term restraint on imports that have surged into the United States. 
   My bill proposes four changes to the way we anticipate and respond to surges in agriculture. 
   First, the Act amends Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to be more responsive to import surges--for any industry. 
   Like the Import Surge Relief Act I introduced last May, co-sponsored by  Senator LEVIN, this bill eases Section 201's overly strict injury standard. No longer will American industry have to comply with a standard higher than that of our international trading partners. They will simply have to prove an increase in imports over a short period of time which cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic market. 
   The Act also speeds up the process for addressing import surges. Recently, I hosted a town hall meeting in Kalispell, Montana. Many agriculture leaders expressed their concern that the process of responding to surges is just too long. The same message came through loud and clear last week when a record number of us in the Congress testified before the International Trade Commission regarding imported Canadian cattle. Relief that is too late can mean the devastation of an industry--and the devastation of Rural America. 
   My bill would cut the time in half for this process and give the ITC Commissioners the ability to make decisions on an expedited basis. 
   It will also bring credibility to the final decision-making process. As we learned in the lamb case, the President has the ultimate decision-making authority. This means he can accept, change or reject recommendations from the International Trade Commission based on information above and beyond the evidence presented during the laborious hearings. 
   My bill requires that the President, in deciding whether to take action, focus more than he has in the past on the beneficial impact of a remedy, rather than on the negative impact on other industries. And in do so, he must make provisional relief available on an urgent basis. 
   Second, the Act establishes an Agricultural Products Import Monitoring and Enforcement Program. The program shall: Promote and defend US policy with respect to import safeguards and countervailing or antidumping duty actions if challenged in the World Trade Organization, identify foreign trade-distorting measures, and develop policies and responsive actions to address such measures. 
   Finally, the bill provides an early warning system. We simply cannot wait until we see that an American industry is devastated. We must be able to project ahead, understand the threats facing an industry, and then consider quickly what type of action to take, if any. 
   My bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to monitor imports and report its findings on a quarterly basis until 2005. This is absolutely critical to take rapid action. 
   Finally, with the next round of the World Trade Organization talks approaching, the expiration of the Farm Bill, and uncertainties in global financial markets, anything can happen. U.S. industry, and our farm communities, however, should not bear the brunt. 
   The Agricultural Import Surge Relief Act will begin to bring stability and predictability back to the system. I urge my colleagues to support this proposal.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Why? Various reasons. 
   First, we have an opportunity to vote this week. I will cast my vote in favor of ratification because I believe to do otherwise would be a tragic mistake with extremely dire consequences for our Nation and equally dire consequences for the world. However, given the likelihood the Senate will fall short of the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution for ratification, I will support efforts to postpone this vote. We cannot tell the world the United States of America, the leader of the free world, opposes this treaty. It would be a travesty. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty gives America a unique opportunity to leave a safer world for our children and for our grandchildren. We cannot prevent earthquakes; we can't prevent hurricanes or tornadoes, not yet. I hope over time our ability to predict them--minimizing the destruction of human life and property--will improve. But we can prevent nuclear war. We can halt the spread of nuclear weapons. We can prevent nuclear fallout and environmental destruction caused by nuclear testing. And we can reduce the fear of a nuclear holocaust that all Americans have lived with since the start of the cold war 50 years ago. We can do all this, and we should. 
   Let me review some of the benefits we get from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and let me explain why this treaty will make the world safer for our children and grandchildren. First, under the CTBT, there is an absolute prohibition against conducting nuclear weapon test explosions by the signators. This would include all countries that possess nuclear weapons, as well as those countries that have nuclear power or research reactors. It would also include countries that do not yet have nuclear facilities. This absolute prohibition of testing makes it much harder for countries that already have advanced nuclear weapons to produce new and more sophisticated nuclear weapons. Russia and China are prime examples. 
   The CTBT prevents the kind of arms competition we had during the cold war. For example, without nuclear tests the Chinese will be unable to MIRV ICBMs with any degree of reliability. The Chinese have no assurance of the effectiveness of putting multiple warheads on missiles because they would not be able to test. Many believe China has made enormous strides in  their nuclear weapons capability because of decades of espionage, but the CTBT provides one way to limit further sophisticated development. 
   The absolute prohibition on nuclear testing also helps prevent countries with smaller and less advanced nuclear weapons from developing more advanced nuclear warheads. This applies especially to India and to Pakistan. The strategy of using advanced nuclear weapons depends on confidence. It depends on reliability. India and Pakistan would not be able to build reliable and sophisticated nuclear weapons under the treaty. 
   The treaty's terms also help prevent nations that are seeking nuclear arms from ever developing them into advanced sophisticated weapons. I refer to countries such as Iran and Iraq. 
   The second major reason for adopting this treaty is that ratification is critical to our ability to enforce and maintain the Non-Proliferation Treaty, another treaty. The NPT is the 
   bedrock of our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms to non-nuclear weapon states. Many of the nations that signed the NPT, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and agreed to its indefinite extension did so on the understanding that there would be a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   The third reason for support is the CTBT will improve the ability of the United States to detect nuclear explosions. Let me repeat that. It will improve our ability to detect current explosions, the status quo compared with today. The international monitoring system will have 321 monitoring stations, including 31 in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the Middle East. These stations will be able to detect explosions down to about 1 kiloton, the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT--much lower than the kinds of explosions we are talking about in this Chamber. In the case of a suspicious event--that is, a report of an explosion that could be nuclear, a mine site, or even an earthquake--any party can request an onsite inspection. With or without a treaty, we must continue all efforts at monitoring nuclear developments worldwide, but the treaty provides a system that far exceeds current capabilities of inspection. 
   Now, turning to two of the major objections to those who oppose the treaty: First, they claim actual nuclear tests--that is, explosions--are necessary to ensure that our stockpile of weapons works. We have put in place a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program. Its purpose is to provide a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of America's inventory of nuclear weapons. Under this program, our National Weapons Laboratories spend $4.5 billion each year to check and to maintain these weapons. We can still test; we do test. We just cannot explode. The Secretaries of Defense and Energy, with the help of the Directors of the National Laboratories, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, and the Nuclear Weapons Council, must certify every year to the President that the necessary high level of confidence exists. 
   Do not forget, $4.5 billion a year is spent on this. If they cannot give that certification to the President, the President can then use the so-called Safeguard F. What is that? That is the United States will be able to withdraw from the treaty and test the weapon that is in doubt; that is, if the President is not confident, the President can withdraw. 
   The Directors of our weapons labs, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with four of his predecessors, and an impressive array of Nobel Prize winners believe the Stewardship Program will provide appropriate protection for our national security. 
   The second objection against the treaty is that it is impossible to verify that all nations are complying with the treaty. That is true. It is true we cannot detect every conceivable explosion at low yields. But our defense agencies have concluded--the Department of Defense--that we will be able to detect tests that will have an impact on our national security, and that is the threshold of concern to us. 
   Let me go through a few likely scenarios that would occur 
   if we reject the treaty. First and most immediate would be on the Indian subcontinent. India and Pakistan matched each other with nuclear tests. Kashmir remains one of the world's most dangerous trigger points. U.S. rejection of the test ban treaty would destroy our ability to pressure those two countries to halt further nuclear tests. Those countries would likely begin to develop more sophisticated nuclear weapons, heightening the probability of their actual use in the region. 
   The second adverse consequence of rejection is this: China would certainly prepare for more tests to increase the sophistication of its nuclear arsenal. At present, Chinese nuclear weapons do not pose a strategic threat to the United States. Our rejection of the CTBT would allow them to begin a long-term development program with testing that would make them such a threat.

   Mr. BAUCUS. The third adverse consequence is American efforts to promote nuclear nonproliferation would become much more difficult because other nations would believe America's moral authority and its leadership were destroyed by our rejection of the CTBT. 
   The United States has been the world's leader in promoting arms control. If we do not lead, no one else will. It is that simple. Our ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention led to its approval by Russia, by China, and others. Our ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will lead other countries to agree to a complete ban on nuclear explosions. 
   As a footnote, let me add the American people, by an overwhelming margin, understand the need to control nuclear testing. In a recent poll, 82 percent of Americans responded that they would like to see the treaty approved. That is not a sufficient reason to vote for ratification, but we should take note the public well understands the dangers of nuclear testing. 
   President Eisenhower began the first comprehensive test ban negotiations in 1958 with the goal of constraining the nuclear arms race and halting the spread of nuclear weapons. Mr. President, 31 years later we have an opportunity to make this goal a reality. That is the legacy I want to leave my son and all the children of Montana, of the United States, and of the world. 
   In sum, I think each of us has a moral obligation to leave this world in as good shape or better shape than we found it, and certainly ratification of the test ban treaty fulfills that moral obligation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am offering today an amendment to address what I believe is a complicated and growing problem for all Americans--flight delays and flight cancellations. 
   The problem is not that delays and cancellations occur. Of course they do. That is only natural. But with different weather conditions, and with the country as large and complicated as it is, and airlines trying to maintain a tight schedule, it is only obvious that schedule can sometimes be deeply affected--by weather or equipment problems--so we must expect occasional delays and occasional cancellations. 
   Right now, it is always a mystery why these delays and cancellations happen. We can guess. We can conjecture. Perhaps it is because of weather. Perhaps it is because of mechanical problems. Perhaps it is the fault of air traffic controllers. There are lots of reasons. But nobody knows--at least the public does not know--precisely the reasons for these delays and for these cancellations. 
   Why is that? It is very simple. The airlines do not have to tell you. There is no requirement. So when you are stuck in an airport in the middle of the night, the airlines might let you know what is going on or they might not tell you. And after you finally reach your destination there's a pretty good chance that you are never going to know why it was you were stranded thousands of miles away from home, or why you missed that important business meeting. The airlines are not required to tell you the reasons for the delays and cancellations. 
   You are probably wondering: Why does this matter? If you are stuck, you are stuck. So what is the big deal? What is the difference? The big deal is that it does matter. It does make a difference, a great deal of difference. Speed and efficiency are not only in the interest of the airline, they are also in the interest of all Americans in this modern society. 
   Time really is money. Flights are often canceled or delayed for economic reasons, and not for mechanical or weather-related reasons. And when these economic delays or cancellations occur, it's usually rural America that gets the short end of the stick. 
   This is no secret. Domestic airlines sometimes have delays not only for mechanical reasons, not only for reasons caused by air traffic controllers, not only for weather reasons, but for purely economic reasons. They do not want that plane to go because it is not filled up enough; it is not economical enough. The airlines do not have to tell you that. 
   I have the headline of an article written by Christene Meyers from the front page of the Billings Gazette last week. The headline reads: ``Enduring Plane Misery, Montana Air Passengers Often Grounded by Economics.'' 
   Let me read you a hypothetical situation from the article, a situation that is not so hypothetical and is happening with increasing frequency:  
   You fly out of Los Angeles at 6:10 p.m., arriving at Salt Lake City at 9 p.m., a minute earlier than estimated. You are delighted and hurry to your gate, to catch the last flight to Billings.  
   It happens all the time.  
   You watch, astonished, as the Billings plane is moved from the gate. You're told that your flight is canceled. You're told that your plane has a mechanical problem.  
   How often have we heard ``mechanical problems'' given to us by the airlines as the problem?  
   Further investigation discloses that the ``mechanical problem'' business was untrue. Truth is your perfectly functional plane was appropriated for a larger market. There were fewer people going to Billings than going to San Diego. You overnight from Salt Lake City and arrive the next day in Billings--12 1/2 hours late.  
   That is if you are lucky because very often the next plane is 
   booked; the next flight after that is booked; the next flight after that is booked; the next flight after that is booked. 
   I am not giving you isolated instances; this happens often in Montana. Montana depends primarily on two major carriers. When a flight is canceled or excessively delayed, there are big consequences. That flight may have been your only chance to get in or out of Montana that day. Again, the plane is not there. It is canceled. You say: OK. Book me on the next flight the next day. 
   Sorry. It is all booked up. It is overbooked. 
   Book me on the next flight. 
   Sorry. Can't. 
   I have talked to people in my State who had to wait 4 days--4 days--at Salt Lake City waiting for the next available flight. The same occurs in Minneapolis. People tell me they are there with several other people trying to get on a plane from Salt Lake City, and they say: Well, gee, why can't we just rent a car? Can Delta Airlines pay for the car rental? We'll drive from Salt Lake City to our home in Bozeman. 
   No. Sorry. It is against airline policy to do that. 
   So people frequently have to take another flight to another city in Montana and then drive or make some other connection. That is not uncommon. 
   Further into this article, a Delta agent from Salt Lake states:  
   If we have 40 people waiting for a flight for Billings and 120 waiting to go to San Francisco, it's a no-brainer........It costs less for us to put 30 people up and send them on to Billings than it does to send 100 California-bound people to a hotel.  
   It is economics. That is wrong. That is not fair. That is not right. If flights are canceled for economic reasons, passengers deserve to know the truth. Let's not fool ourselves. This is not just an inconvenience for rural America; it is much more than an inconvenience. There is also a very direct, strong economic impact. 
   As my home State of Montana, my neighbors in North and South Dakota and Wyoming and Idaho can attest, what business is going to relocate to an area where flight service is not reliable? It is a very basic question. There is a pretty obvious answer. Businesses around the country are going to think twice if reliable flight service cannot be guaranteed. 
   There are delays and cancellations in other parts of the country, but here is the difference. In other parts of the country, in urban parts of the country, there are other flights, there are other airlines; not so for Montana, for the Dakotas, and for Wyoming. There are not that many daily flights, and because the flights have less economic benefit, airlines often cancel flights for economic reasons; and it is not right. 
   Montana ranks near the bottom of per capita individual income right now. I am not saying it is because of airlines, but I am saying it is a factor which tends to discourage businesses from locating or expanding in Montana. How can we improve if we cannot guarantee a minimum standard of quality air service? This is not just a matter of inconvenience; it is a matter of jobs. It is a matter of income. 
   My amendment simply requires that airlines provide all flight information that they currently report and specify the reason why these flights were delayed or canceled. Today, airlines must provide to the Department of Transportation on a monthly basis if an airline flight is delayed, either on arrival or departure. They do not have to give the reasons. They have to disclose that fact. 
   So I am suggesting--not that they have to write a whole big book on the reasons for the cancellations or the reasons for the delays--that they just say why. What caused the cancellation? What caused the delay? 
   So in addition to the information shown on the left-hand side of this chart: the name of the airline; the flight number; the 
   aircraft tail number; the origin and destination airport codes; and the date and day of week of flight--but that in addition--it can also indicate whether the cancellation or delay was caused by air traffic control, caused by mechanical failure or  difficulty, caused by an act of God, caused by weather, or caused by economics. 
   It is a very simple amendment. It does not regulate airlines. It is not imposing new regulations; it is just simply a matter of disclosure--simply giving the reasons why an airline flight is delayed over 15 minutes or just outright canceled. 
   I realize that simply reporting the reasons for cancellations and delays is not going to stop the practice of delaying and canceling flights for economic reasons because airlines are businesses. They may still want to go ahead and cancel or delay a flight for economic reasons. But I do think the public has the right to know the reason for the cancellation or the delay. 
   If airlines have to start reporting the reasons for missed connections and disrupted lives, consumers will soon see that rural America is grounded so that the rest of the country can go about its business. 
   It may turn out that as a consequence there will be fewer cancellations for economic reasons. That is very much my hope, because for many parts of the country, particularly rural America, the airlines' actions are having a disproportionately adverse effect in parts of the country that don't have as much airline service as other parts of the country. 
   That is my amendment. I see one Senator on the floor. I do not know if he will speak to it or not, but I don't see him jumping up in his chair. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am speaking in support of the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act of 1999. 
   Congress faces historic choices in the next few weeks: managed care reform, campaign finance legislation, whether to increase the minimum wage, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But the problem is, Congress is long on disagreement and short on time. In all my years of Congress, I have scarcely seen a more partisan and divisive atmosphere than that which prevails today. 
   One area where Congress appeared ready to act this year is in addressing changes to the Balanced Budget Act, otherwise known as BBA, of 1997. I am disappointed that we have not yet done so. Rural States such as Montana have long battled to preserve access to quality health care. I daresay that the State so ably served by the Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, is in somewhat the same condition. 
   By and large, and against the odds, it is a battle we have generally won. Through initiatives such as the Medical Assistance Facility and the Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant Program, Montana and other relatively thinly populated States have providers who have worked diligently to give Medicare beneficiaries quality health care, but now these providers face a new challenge--the impact of BBA Medicare cuts. 
   From home health to nursing homes, hospital care to hospice, Montana facilities stand to take great losses as a result of the BBA. Many already have. One hospital writes:  
   Dear Senator BAUCUS: 
   The BBA of 1997 is wreaking havoc on the operations of hospitals in Montana. Our numbers are testimony to this. The reduction in reimbursements of $500,000 to $650,000 per year is something our facility cannot absorb.  
   Another tells me:  
   Senator BAUCUS: An early analysis of the negative impact to [my] hospital projects a decrease in reimbursements amounting to an estimated $171,200. My hospital is already losing money from operations and these anticipated decreases in reimbursements will cause a further immediate operating loss. If enacted and implemented, I predict that we will have no choice but to reduce or phase out completely certain services and programs.......  
   Home health agencies report to me that in a recent survey, 80 percent of Montana home health care agencies showed a decline in visits averaging 40 percent. Let me state that again. Of the home health care agencies in my State, 80 percent report a decline in visits averaging 40 percent. These are some of the most efficient home health care agencies in the Nation. It simply is not fair that they are punished for being good at managing costs. 
   As for skilled nursing care in Montana, I saw the effects firsthand in a visit to Sidney Health Center in the northeast corner of my State. A couple of months ago, I had a workday at Sidney. About every month, every 6 weeks, I show up at someplace in my home State with my sack lunch. I am there to work all day long. I wait tables. I work in sawmills. I work in mines--some different job. This time it was working at a hospital. Half of it is a skilled nursing home; the other half an acute care center. 
   At the skilled nursing center, I changed sheets. I took 
   vitals. I worked charts. They even had me take out a few stitches. After a while, I felt as if I was a real-life doctor doing my rounds with my stethoscope casually draped around my neck. One patient actually thought I was in medical training; that is, until I treated that patient. They also had me read to about 20 old folks for about a half hour. I must confess that all but five immediately fell asleep. 
   At the end of the day, I had to turn my stethoscope in for a session with the administrators. The financial folks showed me trends in Medicare reimbursement over the last couple of years. They believe as I do, that the BBA cuts have gone too far. 
   So what do we do about it? Over the next few weeks, the Senate Finance Committee is likely to consider legislation to restore some of the funding cuts for BBA. Anticipating this debate, I introduced comprehensive rural health legislation earlier this year. The bill now has over 30 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. 
   Last week, I joined Senator DASCHLE and the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, as well as Senator ROCKEFELLER, in support of a comprehensive Balanced Budget Act fix, a remedy to try to undo some of the problems we caused. The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act addresses problems the BBA has caused in nursing home care, in home health care, among hospitals and also physical therapy, as well as some other areas. In particular, I draw my colleagues' attention to section 101 of the bill. 
   Medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments for their reasonable costs. To encourage efficiency, however, the BBA called for a system of fixed, limited payments for outpatient departments. This is called the outpatient prospective payment system, known as PPS. Thus far, it appears this PPS will have a very negative impact on small rural hospitals. HCFA estimates--the Health Care Financing Administration--that under this law, Medicare outpatient payments would be cut by over 10 percent for small rural hospitals. I don't have the chart here, but hopefully it is coming later. If you look at the chart, you will see some of the projected impacts on hospitals in my State. 
   Prospective payment is the system of the future, and Congress is right to use it where it works. But in some cases, prospective payment just doesn't work. Consider what happened with inpatient prospective payment about 15 years ago. In 1983, Congress felt, much as it does now, that Medicare reimbursements needed to be held in check. It implemented prospective payment for inpatient services. Enacting that law, it also recognized that for some small, rural facilities, there should be exceptions to prospective payment. 
   The basic reason is simple, because prospective payment is based upon the assumption that the efficient hospitals will do well and survive, and the nearby inefficient hospitals not doing well will fail, but that is OK because people can always go to the surviving efficient hospital. And the assumption, obviously, is invalid for sparsely populated parts of America because if there is a hospital in a sparsely populated part of America that fails under undue pressure because of reimbursement, there is no other hospital or health care facility for somebody in rural America. That is the essential failing in the assumption behind PPS. 
   Congress called these facilities ``sole community hospitals,'' and 42 of the 55 hospitals in my State enjoy that status--that is, the security of being named a sole community provider or medical assistance facility. 
   Section 101 of the bill we introduced last week would provide similar security for outpatient services, and it should be enacted right now. 
   Just last week, the health care research firm, HCIA, and the consulting firm, Ernst and Young, released a study showing that hospital profit margins could fall from their current levels of about 4 percent to below zero by the year 2002. We must act now to ensure that this does not happen. 
   I might say, however, time is running out. We are already in the midst of a 3-week stopgap measure to keep the Government running. If we don't sit down and iron out our differences soon, we risk going home not having acted on the BBA and not correcting this problem, which I think is irresponsible. 
   Despite the partisan atmosphere that has prevailed here over the last several months, Congress does have a record of success in dealing with important health care issues in a bipartisan way. 
   A few years ago, we passed the Health Insurance Portability Act to prevent people from losing health insurance when they change jobs. 
   In 1997, we worked together--Members of all stripes--in passing the Children's Health Insurance Plan, legislation to provide children of working families with health insurance. Just last week, children in my State started enrollment in that program. 
   With some common sense on both sides of the aisle and with fast action on the issue, Congress can come together to solve some of the problems caused by the so-called BBA of 1997. We ought to do so, and we ought to do it right now. 
   Mr. President, you might be interested in what some of the conditions of  the BBA 1997 are in the State of the Presiding Officer. In Maine, the hospital in Bangor would lose 24 percent of payments it would otherwise receive. Booth Bay Harbor would find about a 38-percent reduction. That is somewhat typical of hospitals of that size and in that situation around the country. 
   So I hope that at the appropriate time we can work with dispatch and expeditiously solve this problem before we adjourn.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, since the end of the Second World War, the United States has led the world in establishing an open, rule-based trade system. I believe it is very important that we continue to provide this leadership. We can only do this if we maintain a domestic consensus on trade policy. 
   The United States has also provided strong international leadership on environmental protection. I have long been a strong proponent of both open trade and environmental protection. I have a foot in both camps. So today I am proud to introduce a bill which addresses both trade and the environment. I am joined in this effort by Senators GRAMS, MURRAY, and WYDEN. 
   I know people in the trade community who assume that anything good for the environment must be bad for business. They believe that protecting the environment means more government restrictions, higher costs, and lower profits. This logic is flawed. 
   I also know people in the environmental community who assume that anything good for trade must be bad for the environment. They believe that more trade means more growth, and that more growth means more damage to the environment. This logic is flawed, too. 
   We can take measures which benefit both trade and the environment. I am proposing one such measure today: eliminating import duties on environmental products as part of a multilateral agreement. This enjoys wide support from American environmental technology companies, as well as from members of the environmental community. 
   Mr. President, let me recall a bit of recent trade history. During the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the United States participated in a number of sectoral tariff initiatives. They were known as ``zero-for-zero.'' Countries agreed to reciprocal tariff elimination, saying ``I'll put my tariff at zero, if you'll do the same.'' 
   The Uruguay Round Act gave the President the authority to eliminate U.S. tariffs in these ``zero-for-zero'' sectors. But in several sectors, the negotiators did not reach agreement. The President retains tariff authority in these sectors. Examples are products like furniture and paper. Some of these sectors are once again under discussion in the WTO. 
   In addition to these unfinished Uruguay Round sectors, the United States launched other zero-for-zero initiatives. This work began in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and then moved to the WTO. One of the sectors under discussion is environmental goods. 
   Environmental goods cover a wide range of products made in America to control air, water and noise pollution, as well as solid and hazardous waste. These products include equipment for recycling and for renewable energy.  They include technology for remediation and cleanup. Environmental goods also include scientific equipment for monitoring and analysis. All told, U.S. firms sell somewhere between $20 and $40 billion abroad annually. They could sell more if other countries would eliminate trade barriers, including tariffs. 
   In my home state of Montana, businesses which export environmental equipment could expand their operations if they faced fewer foreign barriers. I have heard from one company, SRS Crisafulli, which is working in Latin America markets. Tariffs on their dredging equipment raise their sales price substantially. The inexorable law of the market is that higher sales prices mean lower sales. 
   As my colleagues know, the United States maintains the world's most open market. Our tariffs are generally low. They are especially low on environmental goods, where U.S. import duties average less than 2%. This bill I am introducing today would eliminate these small tariffs--nuisance tariffs, really. In return, other countries would abolish their import duties on American-made products. Their tariffs can be three or four times higher than ours. That's a good deal for us, and a good deal for world trade. 
   It's also a good deal for the environment. The biggest importers of these products are the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Expanding the use of environmental technology will help limit or remedy environmental damage. It will have a positive impact on public health and the quality of life. 
   Mr. President, the bill I am introducing preserves Congress' constitutional role in foreign trade. It requires the President to consult with us before implementing any environmental tariff cuts. And I would like to put our trade negotiators on notice that we expect them to bring to us a proposal with broad coverage, rapid staging and limited exceptions. 
   I am particularly concerned about the scope of the agreement now being negotiated. I understand that some of our trading partners in APEC were unwilling to classify certain products as ``environmental goods'' because they are ``dual use.'' A hydraulic pump, for instance, can be used for either a sewage treatment plant or a microchip plant. We should press other countries to adopt a broad definition of ``environmental goods'' to encourage dissemination of technology. 
   Mr. President, ever since environmental tariff elimination surfaced, the U.S. told our trading partners not to worry that the President lacks tariff-cutting authority in the sector. When the time comes, we said, Congress will grant the necessary authority. I believe this effort merits the same kind of support from the Senate that it has gained support among the trade and environmental communities. It is particularly important that we show this support now, as the United States prepares to host the WTO Trade Ministers Meeting in Seattle. I encourage all of my colleagues to provide this support.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I very much appreciate the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New Jersey for letting me go ahead of them. 
   I agree with the statement of the Senator from New Jersey complimenting the Senator from West Virginia, and, in the same vein, the earlier remarks of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. The fact is, our farmers are in desperate straits, and this Congress is doing very little about it. It is that simple. No one can dispute that, and many of us are, quite frankly, concerned because the Senate is not doing enough. Because it looks as if the Senate might not do enough, we will be constrained to take extraordinary measures in the Senate to stand up for our constituents, the people who sent us here; namely, the farmers, in this instance, to pass as best we can appropriate and remedial legislation to help our farmers. It is that simple. 
   I compliment the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from New Jersey, and others.  
   In fact, that is very relevant to the statement I am going to make concerning the introduction of a bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Agriculture Fair Trade Act of 1999. I am joined by Senator GORTON of Washington and Senator BINGAMAN of New Mexico. 
   I begin by saying I believe the next round of the WTO is vital to American farmers. As a Senator who represents Montana, a State whose primary industry is agriculture, this next round will decide the fate of our next generation of producers. It is that simple. 
   It is becoming increasingly clear that while the rest of the Nation continues to experience astounding economic growth and prosperity through open and global trade, America's farmers and ranchers across the Nation are suffering, and they have yet to reap the fruits of free trade's bounty. 
   During the last several months, we have worked to identify goals for agriculture in the next round of the WTO. The consensus is that we must step up our efforts dramatically in order to make genuine progress in leveling the playing field for our agriculture industry. 
   It is our intention that this bill will begin this process. The Agriculture Fair Trade Act provides a mechanism through which we can target unfair export subsidies and fight for their total elimination by January 1, 2003. 
   It is our hope that such legislation will provide an incentive for our trading partners to voluntarily reduce their export subsidies during the next round of the WTO. The elimination of these subsidies will benefit farmers on both sides of the Atlantic. 
   I believe this act provides a powerful two-tier trigger approach to the reduction of export subsidies. 
   First, the European Union must reduce its agriculture export subsidies by 50 percent by January 1, 2002. If the EU fails to do so, the U.S. Agriculture Secretary shall take appropriate measures to protect the interests of American agricultural producers and ensure the international competitiveness of U.S. agriculture. 
   In particular, the Secretary shall be authorized to target EU's most sensitive export market for grains and spend over $1 billion in Export Enhancement Program funding in that market. 
   Step 2 requires the EU to enter into an agreement with the United States by January 1, 2003. The EU must agree to completely eliminate its export subsidies, and if not, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture shall be authorized to, again, target EU's most sensitive export market for grain, double the Export Enhancement Program to $2 billion, and increase and utilize export funding for market promotion and direct ag export credit sales in the best interest of American ag producers. 
   It is high time the Senate takes action to ensure that the next round of negotiations result in benefits to our agricultural producers. 
   Why target EU export subsidies? I believe the United States has taken the high road in leading by example. That lead hurts U.S. producers. The United States has long taken the position that if we reduce support for agriculture, especially export subsidies, we will get a fair trading system. 
   That is not the case across the Atlantic, where the EU export subsidies are 60 times greater than export subsidies in the United States. In fact, the EU accounts for nearly 85 percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies. 
   I can remember in the 1980s when the U.S. and EU engaged in an ``export subsidy war.'' At the same time, they both battled to undercut each other's prices in the world's wheat export markets. But over the decade, U.S. market share declined while EU market share increased dramatically. 
   Europe, formerly the world's largest net importer, suddenly became the world's largest net exporter of agricultural products. It had nothing to do with luck. It had everything to do with their aggressive use of export subsidies. 
   How did the United States fight back? We didn't. To date, the United States maintains an anemic Export Enhancement Program. Authorized at $500 million a year, EEP operates well below its Uruguay Round reduction commitments. If EEP is to be a credible tool in international trade, it is high time we start flexing its muscle. 
   The United States will remain the most open market in the world. I am committed to that. At the same time, we must do everything possible to open foreign markets. A ``trigger'' is the first step--it has leverage--but one that must be taken as a very large stride in the path toward free trade. 
   Again, I thank Senators GORTON and BINGAMAN for cosponsoring this legislation. I urge my colleagues vested in the future of American agriculture to join us in this endeavor.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 1984, Congress created the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a charitable, nonprofit corporation with the mission of conserving our nation's fish, wildlife, plant, and other natural resources. The Foundation's creation was championed by congressional members from both sides of the aisle, including my esteemed colleague on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Chairman JOHN CHAFEE. The bipartisan support the Foundation received in Congress reflected broad agreement that additional efforts were needed to protect and manage our natural resources. 
   Over the past 15 years, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has established a solid track record. The Foundation has achieved on-the-ground results. It has also stretched federal dollars and built public-private partnerships essential to conservation efforts. The Foundation has provided more than 3,500 grants to over 940 private local organizations, state and county governments, tribes, federal and interstate agencies, and colleges and universities in all 50 states. By requiring grantees to match Foundation grants with non-federal funds, the $135 million in federal funds invested by the Foundation have been leveraged to deliver more than $440 million to natural resource conservation efforts. Significantly, these funds are used to help build public-private partnerships among individual landowners, government and tribal agencies, conservation organizations, and business. The result is the development of consensus, locally-driven solutions to the challenges involved in protecting and managing fish, wildlife, plants, and other natural resources. 
   In my home state of Montana, where fishing, hunting, and the enjoyment of our natural resources are deeply ingrained into our way of life, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has made important contributions to conservation efforts. These contributions include supporting environmental education, habitat restoration and protection, resource management, and the development of conservation policy. For example, public-private partnerships have been established to restore and protect native fish species, such as Arctic grayling, bull trout, and cutthroat trout, prized by anglers. Working with landowners, thousands of acres of lands have been purchased and easements acquired to benefit elk, bighorn sheep, mule deer, other game animals. Support has been provided to county and tribal efforts to control the spread of noxious weed species that threaten farms, rangelands, wildlife habitat, and recreation areas. In total, the Foundation has funded 187 projects and delivered a total of almost $13 million to conservation projects in Montana.  
   Mr. President, even with the accomplishments of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the need to conserve the nation's natural resources remains. Today, in too many areas of the country, the health and sustainability of fish, wildlife, and plants, and the habitats on which they depend, are threatened. Bitter disputes continue to arise among interests when solutions to difficult natural resource problems are sought. Tight budgets often severely limit the ability of governments and private entities to adequately address conservation challenges. Because of this, the need for an organization such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which promotes conservation, builds partnerships and consensus, and stretches dollars, is as clear today as it was in 1984 
   The bill we are introducing today, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act Amendments of 1999, will increase the Foundation's ability to continue to carry out is important mission. First and foremost, the legislation authorizes federal appropriations through 2004 to support the Foundation's work. The legislation also strengthens the Foundation by increasing the size of its board of directors and allowing board members to be removed for nonperformance. Finally, the bill broadens the Foundation's authority by allowing it to work with all agencies within the Departments of Interior and Commerce. This legislation is nearly identical to the legislation passed by the Senate last year. 
   Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has provided valuable assistance to this nation's natural resource conservation efforts over the past 15 years. If the legislation we are introducing today is passed, I have no doubt that the Foundation will continue it solid record of accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to join the bipartisan group of cosponsors and support this important legislation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Rural Provider Act of 1999. 
   Small, rural hospitals have always played a vital role in ensuring access to quality health care. Today, rural hospitals are as important as ever. Half of all American hospitals are in rural areas, and these institutions account for fully one-quarter of the hospital beds in our country. And rural hospitals across America are expanding and improving their services, from disease prevention to rehabilitation to outpatient surgery. 
   But if the outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) goes into effect as currently proposed, rural hospitals in Montana and across the nation will lose millions of dollars in Medicare payments each year. Some of our smallest hospitals--the ones we should be supporting the most--will lose more than half of their current payments. That's just not right, and we should pass legislation to fix it. 
   Why does the outpatient PPS pose such a threat to small, rural hospitals? As you know, Mr. President, instead of reimbursing hospitals for the actual costs that they incur, a PPS would pay hospitals on a fixed, limited rate. That might make sense for a large hospital in Chicago or New York City that sees thousands of patients every day. But it doesn't make sense for a small hospital that doesn't enjoy the same economies of scale. It certainly doesn't make sense for Madison Valley Hospital, in Ennis, Montana, which would face an estimated 62.6 percent cut in outpatient payments under PPS. 
   Mr. President, how can small, rural hospitals, already struggling to improve their services with limited funds, survive and operate with half as much money? How can hospitals that rely on Medicare patients for most of their revenue endure a 50 percent pay-cut? The simple answer is: they cannot. 
   And let's remember, Mr. President, many of these hospitals are home to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHAs). These are the same SNFs and HHAs that have already been harmed by new prospective payment systems of their own. 
   This is a very simple bill. It would allow small, rural hospitals to opt out of the outpatient PPS. Without this bill, hospitals all across rural America will face devastating shortfalls in the coming year--and the quality of our country's health care will suffer. With this bill, the small hospitals that serve rural Americans throughout the nation can continue to improve the quality of their services. 
   Passing this bill is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished colleague, the esteemed Senator from Rhode Island, Senator CHAFEE, to safeguard the funding allocation of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. We call it TEA 21, the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century. 
   What is it? It is a very large, massive transportation bill that this Congress passed a couple of years ago--about $217 billion over 6 years in highway funds and transit funds for the States. It is very important legislation to address this country's infrastructure needs. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island will soon raise a point of order under rule  XVI against a provision in that bill; that is, against a provision in this bill before us, the Transportation appropriations bill, the provision which rewrites a section of TEA 21, known as RABA. What in the world is RABA? RABA is the ``revenue aligned budget authority.'' I will explain that in just a second. 
   This section, the RABA section, is totally within the jurisdiction of one committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the authorizing committee, and thus the provision in this appropriations bill constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in clear violation of rule XVI. 
   Let me briefly explain how we got to this point. 
   Last week, many of us--49 of us--stood together against another proposal in this bill to rewrite the TEA 21 formula when this case was for transit. Even though the proposed change would have reduced funds for only California and New York--that is, the transit provision that was earlier proposed by the Appropriations Committee--that provision would have increased funds for the remaining 48 States. 
   I was pleased that my colleagues supported the provision to not include that because it was the right thing to do. 
   The transit formula agreed to in TEA 21, along with other provisions in TEA 21, particularly the highway provision, was part of a grand bargain on which we worked together so hard to write last year. Even though most States would have benefited somewhat from the proposed change in this bill--that is, the transit provision I mentioned--we stuck together to preserve the original intent of TEA 21. We voted to protect the integrity of TEA 21; that is, the highway bill. We voted for the program as it exists and against the Transportation Committee rewrite of the bill. 
   The chairman of the subcommittee then removed that provision from the bill. I commend him for that. It was the right action to take. I compliment him for it. But, unfortunately, he solved only part of the problem; that is, the transit piece. I say ``unfortunately'' because the reported bill before us from the Appropriations Committee also contained a provision that redistributes a portion of the highway funds as well. 
   These funds are known as RABA, as I mentioned earlier--revenue aligned budget authority--that result from the greater than expected revenues coming into the highway trust fund because the economy is doing quite well; that is, more people are driving. The economy is doing well. That means more gasoline tax revenues. The RABA provision anticipated that. It explained how those increased funds should be dealt with. This year that increases because the economy is doing well. It amounts to about $1.45 billion again for the year. 
   The highway bill stakes out new ground by putting into law the requirement that all gas tax revenues coming into the highway trust fund--that is, about $28 billion for this year--should be spent on highways. That is, all gasoline tax revenue should be spent on highways and a portion for mass transit but not for other purposes. 
   A number of Members of this body worked very hard to achieve that goal--Senators BYRD, WARNER, GRAMM, LOTT, and many others --to say nothing at all about the House Members in the other body who worked equally hard. It is a landmark achievement. It restored some measure of trust to the highway trust fund. 
   TEA 21 provided that if gas tax receipts are greater than originally estimated--this is the RABA provision--the increased revenue will also go into the trust fund. That is what TEA 21 provides. And it will be distributed in a very specific way. Again, that is what TEA 21 specifically provides. 
   What did it provide? Approximately 90 percent would go to States by formula--that is, the core programs--and about 10 percent to a variety of smaller but equally important programs that were not tied to individual States. 
   The chart I have now before us shows that these include--that is, these other programs, the 10 percent include programs to fund roads on national parks. For example, it includes Federal lands highway programs and Indian reservation roads. 
   Just think about all of us who have Indian reservation roads in our States. The provision of the Transportation Subcommittee would say none of the increase would go to Indian reservation roads. 
   Public lands highways are very important to many Senators, particularly their States. 
   I mention the national parks and refuge roads. 
   What about the border infrastructure program? Many Senators, when writing the highway bill, came to us and said: We need a particular provision in the highway bill--that is, TEA 21--to address border infrastructure needs. We agreed. We put in that provision. But the Appropriations Committee said none of the increased funds will go to that. 
   What about the national scenic byways program? It is very important to many States so that the picturesque highways in our States have funds equally allocated as all other needs and will receive funds in the event of additional dollars. 
   Ferry boats and terminals: Yes, ferry boats and terminals would get none of the increase under the Transportation Committee bill--none. That is wrong because it was contemplated, when we wrote this bill together, they would get that. 
   Then I mention transportation and community preservation. 
   The main point is that these were bargained-for and fought-for provisions in TEA 21, the highway bill, and everyone assumed, because that was the provision in the highway bill, that if there were additional funds, they, too, would get their fair share of the increase. 
   It is very important for Members to realize that these are provisions which have not just increased dollars because of the provisions that are in the Appropriations Committee bill. 
   I don't have to remind you of the difficult debates we had over funding formulas among the Northeast States, the donor States, and the Western States. I have to tell you that it was not easy. There were many meetings. They were tough meetings. But in the end we achieved a bill--the TEA 21 bill--that was supported by 88 Senators. It was bipartisan. It was supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   It was not just a distribution of money among the States that generated so much support for TEA 21. It also is the host of the smaller programs I just mentioned. They are called the allocated programs or the discretionary programs in which individual Senators had very specific interests. 
   Senators from Alaska, Hawaii, and New Jersey came to support provisions such as ferry boats. Likewise, Senators from the public land States--from Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Nevada--wanted help in meeting unique needs in their States. These are the provisions we have written into the bill, the so-called allocated discretionary provisions that are not included in their fair share of the increase of highway funds in the bill provided for the forests. 
   Senators from border States--Texas, Arizona, New York, and California--needed special attention on the dilapidated border crossings impeding trade and economic development in their States. 
   In the same vein, Members along potential trade corridors through the Midwest had individual interests they wanted to include in the bill, but the provision before the Senate will not allow those provisions to get their fair share. 
   I mentioned Senators seeking help for scenic byways and communities across our country. 
   TEA 21 was not just about funding State highway programs; it was also about a broad range of transportation needs identified not just by States but by individual Senators. 
   Earlier, I mentioned gas tax revenues were flowing to the trust fund faster than expected, to the tune of $1.45 billion in fiscal year 2000. TEA 21 provided for a fair distribution of that revenue growth. Again, unfortunately, the Transportation appropriations bill prevents the allocated programs--the discretionary programs--from sharing in this growth. 
   The bill before the Senate zeros out about $120 million in funding for public lands, the border crossings, ferry boats, Indian reservations, research, and other allocated programs, and instead distributes that increase to the States  only through the core highway programs. I am not against the core highway programs. I strongly support them. But that is not the issue. What is at issue is the protection of the integrity of TEA 21 and fair treatment for these allocated programs I have just mentioned. 
   Why did the appropriations bill change this part of TEA 21? Is there a problem with the TEA 21 distribution? Is there anything wrong with these programs? If there is, it is news to me. I have not heard it. Nobody has mentioned it. More importantly, if something is flawed with the distribution of these programs, let's have a hearing, get the facts, and find out what is going on before we run off and start changing things for no good reason. Let's do it in the committee with jurisdiction of the highway bill, the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   Some might ask, what is all this fuss over such a small amount of money? After all, this bill redistributes only about $120 million, an average increase of just one-third of 1 percent of the State's highway dollars. It is because I see this as a start of a very dangerous process. Highway bills are 6-year authorizations for a very good reason. Highways take time to plan, to design, to build. Our State highway departments need some level of certainty about future funding levels to plan 
   properly. 
   I followed closely what my State of Montana is doing for planning these projects. Stable funding is absolutely vital; stability in highway spending is absolutely vital so States can plan. Without stability, highway and transit projects will proceed more slowly. As highway construction slows down, fewer jobs will be created, economic activity is reduced, working men and women--many with families to be supported--will be hurt. 
   Furthermore, once we send the signal that it is open season for highway funding in appropriations bills, whose ox will be gored next? Today it is the allocated programs, the discretionary programs, scenic roads, ferry boats, border crossings, park roads; today only $120 million. Tomorrow, who knows. I know Senator CHAFEE and I have a tough sell here. All 50 States will get a little more money under this bill than under TEA 21. Normally, around here that is called a no brainer. If it is more money, Members vote for it. 
   Look where the money comes from, and I ask if you still support this provision. Tell the tribal leader the Indian road program doesn't need anymore money. Tell the economic development leaders in your communities that border crossings, trade corridors, don't deserve anymore funding. Or tell the mayors that scenic byways and ferry boats have to get by with a little less than we promised last year, while others get a little more than we promised. 
   Let's treat all programs fairly, let them all share in the revenue growth, not just a few. 
   This is what our Governors, highway officials, and others say about the TEA 21 promises. This chart includes quotes from letters from key highway user groups. 
   Trust Coalition, the main coalition that worked so hard with us as we put together the highway bill:  
   ......remind Congress of the importance of keeping its proposition in TEA 21 in the annual budgeting and appropriations process.  
   Another letter from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials:  
   Expend additional..... annual [highway trust fund] revenues ....., and allocate them as provided under TEA 21.  
   From the National Governors' Association, a group this body listens to quite frequently and faithfully:  
   Ensure that all increases in revenue in the Highway Trust Fund are directed to their intended purposes as outlined in TEA 21.  
   I ask my colleagues to think very carefully about this issue. To say this vote is about a few more dollars for your State on top of the hundreds of millions received under TEA 21 is to miss the point. Do not pit the interests of State against the interests of public lands or ferry boats or trade corridors or border crossings. Do not start down the path of turning highway funding into a political grab bag each year. 
   Unless someone can show me how the distribution formula of TEA 21 is broken and needs to be fixed, I am prepared to stick with the highway bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator CHAFEE, and Senator WARNER and reaffirm our support for TEA 21 and reject the redistribution contained in this bill. 
   A final point: When we raise this point of order, we mean no disrespect to the Appropriations Committee or its leaders. They have a very difficult job to do. They have a difficult job to do in the best years. This, I might add, is not the best of years with the problems they are facing with the budget caps and allocations. It is a very difficult problem. I understand that. I deeply respect that. They have their responsibilities and I respect that. But the authorizing committees also have their responsibilities. I hope the appropriators in the Senate respect that, too. That is why I supported the reimposition of rule XVI earlier this year. It is a matter of respect. The appropriations subcommittees do their work; we respect their work. The authorizing committees do their work, and we hope that work can be respected, as well. That is what this issue is about. It restores the will of order around here and allows the appropriations and authorizing committees to concentrate on what they know best. Let's keep it that way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I want to point out the provision referred to by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation in his own bill says clearly ``notwithstanding Public Law 105-178.'' Even though the law says differently, this is what the committee is going to find. The committee's own language indicates that it is a change because the committee's language says, as just reported by the chairman of the committee, notwithstanding the ISTEA bill; that is, in spite of the ISTEA bill, this is the change we are going to make.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator says this legislation on his appropriations bill is germane because he says in the House bill there is language which redistributes the funds. Therefore, he says it is germane. 
   I ask the Senator if he could point out to me where that language is in the House bill. And let me say, before the Senator answers the question, that it is highly unlikely, as all Members of this body know, that such language exists, because the chairman of the Transportation Committee in the House, Mr. SHUSTER, would not stand for it. 
   So I would like, if the Senator could, for him to show me in his bill where----

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say, with all respect to my very good friend and colleague, that language refers to just spending the money that must be spent under ISTEA. There is no language there which addresses a reallocation of additional dollars. I must very respectfully say to my good friend, the language he cited does not in any way purport to do what he likes to say it does. 
   I just follow up by saying that what this comes down to is respect. We in the authorizing committee respect the job of the Appropriations Committee. They have a very difficult job. They do their work very well. I just hope the Appropriations Committee members will respect the work of the authorizing committee. 
   As the Senator from Virginia pointed out, there is a reason that this is a 6-year bill, that every year we do not come back and try to pass a highway bill. It is because of the nature of the beast. Highway legislation requires long-term planning. It does not make sense for this body to start going down the road--no pun intended--of starting to rewrite the highway bill every year in the Transportation Appropriations Committee. That is just bad public policy. It is the wrong thing to do. I think every Member knows it is the wrong thing to do, if he or she just stops to think about it. 
   I thank the Chair and my colleague very much, and particularly I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, the leader of our committee, who is bringing this issue to our attention. 
   Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to create a new Congressional Trade Office that will provide the Congress with additional trade expertise--independent, non-partisan, and neutral expertise. 
   Over the past 25 years that I have served in the Congress, I have watched a continuing transfer of authority and responsibility for trade policy from the Congress to the Executive Branch. The trend has been subtle, but it has been clear and constant. We need to reverse this trend. Congress has the Constitutional authority to provide more effective and active oversight of our nation's trade policy, and we should use it. Congress should be more active in setting the direction for the Executive Branch in its formulation of trade policy. I believe strongly that we must re-assert Congress' constitutionally defined responsibility for international commerce. 
   The Congressional Trade Office will provide the entire Congress, through the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, with this additional trade expertise. 
   I am proposing that the Congressional Trade Office have three sets of responsibilities. 
   First, it will monitor compliance with major bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements. It will analyze the success of those agreements based on commercial results, and it will do this in close consultation with the affected industries. It will recommend actions necessary to ensure that those countries that have made commitments to the United States fully abide by those commitments. It will also provide annual assessments of the extent to which current agreements comply with labor goals and with environmental goals in those agreements. 
   Second, the Congressional Trade Office will have an analytic function. For example, after the Administration delivers its National Trade Estimates report to the Congress each year, it will analyze the major outstanding trade barriers based on the cost to the U.S. economy. After the Administration delivers its Trade Policy Agenda to the Congress each year, it will provide an analysis of that agenda, including alternative goals, strategies, and tactics. 
   The Congressional Trade Office will analyze proposed trade agreements, including agreements that do not require legislation to enter into effect. It will analyze the impact of Administration trade policy actions, including an assessment of the Administration's argument for not accepting an unfair trade practices case. And it will analyze the trade accounts every quarter, including the global current account, the global trade account, and key bilateral trade accounts. 
   Third, the Congressional Trade Office will be active in dispute settlement deliberations. It will evaluate each WTO decision where the U.S. is a participant. In the case of a U.S. loss, it will explain why it lost. In the case of a U.S. win, it will measure the commercial results from that decision. It will do a similar evaluation for NAFTA disputes. Congressional Trade Office staff will participate as observers on the U.S. delegation at dispute settlement panel meetings at the WTO. 
   The Congressional Trade Office is designed to service the Congress. Its Director will report to the Senate Finance Committee 
   and the House Ways and Means Committee. It will also advise other committees on the impact of trade negotiations and the Administration's trade policy on those committees' areas of jurisdiction. 
   The staff will include a group of professionals with a mix of expertise in economics and trade law, plus in various industries and geographic regions. My expectation is that staff members will see this as a career position, thus, providing the Congress with long-term institutional memory. 
   The Congressional Trade Office will work closely with other government entities involved in trade policy assessment, including the Congressional Research Service, the General Accounting Office, and the International Trade Commission. The Congressional Trade Office will not replace those agencies. Rather, the Congressional Trade Office will supplement their work, and leverage the work of those entities to provide the Congress with timely analysis, information, and advice. 
   The areas of dispute resolution and compliance with trade agreements are central. The credibility of the global trading system, and the integrity of American trade law, depend on the belief, held by trade professionals, political leaders, industry representatives, workers, farmers, and the public at large, that agreements made are agreements followed. They must be fully implemented. There must be effective enforcement. Dispute settlement must be rapid and effective. 
   Often more energy goes into negotiating new agreements than into ensuring that existing agreements work. Of course, it is necessary to continue efforts at trade liberalization globally. But support for those efforts is a direct function of the perception that agreements work. The Administration has increased the resources it devotes to compliance. But an independent and neutral assessment of compliance is necessary. It is unrealistic to expect an agency that negotiated an agreement to provide a totally objective and dispassionate assessment of that agreement's success or failure. 
   The Congressional Trade Office will perform an annual evaluation of the commercial results of selected major bilateral trade agreements. The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan did this type of evaluation several years ago, examining in detail 45 bilateral agreements, and their conclusions were shocking. Fewer than one-third of those agreements were considered fully successful by the industries affected. The Congressional Trade Office should do this evaluation with our major trading partners. They will also recommend actions necessary to ensure that these agreements are fully implemented. 
   Looking at the WTO dispute settlement process, I don't think we even know whether it has been successful or not from the perspective of U.S. commercial interests. A count of wins versus losses tells us nothing. The Congressional Trade Office will give us the facts we need to evaluate this process properly. 
   Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution says: ``The Congress shall have power ..... To regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' It is our responsibility to provide oversight and direction on US trade policy. The Congressional Trade Office, as I have outlined it today, will provide us in the Congress with the means to do so.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair and my colleagues for a very brief statement. 
   Those of us who were here and those of us who were not here but certainly  have an idea about it remember the effort that was put into passing TEA 21, the highway bill, a couple of years ago. Many Senators worked very long and hard. 
   I see the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator LAUTENBERG; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator SHELBY; Senator BYRD mightily helped put together a massive highway bill, otherwise known as TEA 21; Senator WARNER of Virginia; and, of course, the chairman of the committee, Senator CHAFEE. I assisted; Senator MOYNIHAN helped a lot; the majority leader, Senator LOTT. We had many meetings in Senator LOTT's office trying to put together all the provisions of the highway bill. 
   As one might guess, it is extremely complex. There were the Northeast States that had a certain point of view as to how the dollars should be allocated; the Western States thought they did not get a fair deal in the previous 6-year highway bill known as ISTEA; the Southern States. Then there were donee and donor States. There were groups that wanted more so-called CMAQ money. That is money that goes to areas to help them mitigate against pollution in their cities caused by automobiles and trucks. There were enhancement funds. Enhancement funds are for bikeways and other associated highway programs. There was research and development. There were intelligent highway systems. There were public lands. There were discretionary funds. There was park money. You name it. There were lots of competing interests that were put together a couple of years ago. 
   We finally put together a highway bill, and it passed on a bipartisan basis, a large vote: 89 Senators voted for it after much gnashing of teeth about what we were going to do with the 4.3 cents that was otherwise set aside for debt reduction in a previous Congress. We finally decided that was going to go to the highway program. 
   Our basic principle we agreed to was that all Federal gasoline taxes paid would go to the highway fund, and from the highway fund that money all goes back out to the States in the form of related highway programs, all funded with the gasoline tax. That was a major statement that TEA 21 made, the highway bill we passed a couple years ago. 
   It has worked quite well. On average, States got about a 40-percent increase each year compared with the previous 6 years; some States a little more, some less; but in the whole scheme of things it worked out quite well: On average, a 40-percent increase each year compared to the prior year. 
   This year we are considering the Transportation appropriations bill, the appropriations bill which basically says: OK, this money that is in the highway program, although there is contract authority that says the money has to be spent on highways, still, the Transportation Appropriations Committee basically just spends it. That is what it does. 
   There is a provision in the highway bill, TEA 21, which says this: Any additional money that comes into the highway trust fund--unanticipated additional money, presumably on account of a growing economy; and our economy has grown--will then be allocated, to the degree it is allocated, back to the States in the same way the highway bill itself was put together; that is, a certain percent under CMAQ, a certain percent under service transportation, a certain percent under minimum guarantees, a certain percent to public lands, et cetera; and in the same way. 
   It turns out that because of the additional gasoline taxes in the last year as a consequence of a prosperous economy, there is an additional $1.5 billion that is to be allocated under the highway bill according to the way the highway bill was put together. So there are no changes. 
   It turns out, with all due respect to the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, they have decided to change the highway bill, to rewrite it, and, rather than to have the money spent as provided for in the highway bill, to instead take all of that money--instead of, say, 10 percent as provided for under the highway bill under certain discretionary programs and 90 percent under the core highway programs--they take it all and put it under the core highway programs. I think that is very dangerous. It is a very dangerous precedent. 
   First of all, it is legislation on an appropriations bill. It is rewriting, adding legislation on an appropriations bill. Second, it is a precedent of the Appropriations Committee of, in effect, rewriting the program. 
   I grant you, this is a small matter. As a consequence of the Appropriations Committee's action, instead of $1.4 billion going to the core programs, $1.5 billion is going to the core programs. The additional that is going to the core programs does not go to the various programs I mentioned. 
   You might ask: Gee, what is the big deal? That is only about $120 million. The big deal is this. First of all, it is not much money, $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion. Second, it is a big principle, because once we start down this slippery slope of the Transportation Appropriations Committee rewriting the highway bill and how dollars are allocated among States, then we are going to be tempted in following Congresses to take a bigger bite of the apple to redistribute even more. 
   Why is that a problem? That is a problem because highway programs take time. State highway departments must plan ahead. It takes 2 or 3 years, from conception to design, to bid letting, to construction, to build highways or to resurface. It is not a spigot you just turn on and off yearly. It takes time. 
   Second, here is another real concern I have. If the Appropriations Committee is rewriting the highway bill, then it is going to become political; the majority party is going to be determining the provisions in the highway bill. There will not be 
   a bipartisan allocation of highway dollars; it will be a majority party allocation of highway dollars. 
   With all due respect, this is not an abstraction; this has happened in the concrete. In fact, the bill that was about to come to the floor did just what I feared would happen; namely--not the highway part but the mass transit part--the committee rewrote the bill, which took many dollars away from two States, California and New York. It does not take much imagination to figure out whether the Senators from those two States are in the majority party or the minority party. 
   I am just very concerned we are going to set the precedent of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, A, rewriting the highway bill, which is bad because it takes a long time to plan these projects, and upsetting the apple cart which took a lot of effort to put together--I mentioned Senators BYRD, WARNER, CHAFEE, LOTT, and all of us--to try to work to put all the pieces together, but also because the majority party is going to be sorely tempted to be political; that is, to give dollars to the States of the majority party but not dollars to the States of the minority party. That might change. It might be the Democrats who are in the majority. Then that precedent will be set. That is not a good precedent. We should instead just do what is right. 
   I will sum up by saying it is true that every State will get a few more dollars under the rewrite by the Appropriations Committee. It averages about .35 percent. Gee, every State is getting a few more dollars--not many--so why not support it? My point is, it is only a few dollars. It is not going to really affect the States much at all. But it is the principle of going down the slippery slope of rewriting the highway bill without hearings, without any field hearings and hearings here in the Senate. The EPW Committee has not had hearings on this subject. The Appropriations Committee has not had hearings on this subject. 
   Just basically, it is political. I will not object at this point, but at the appropriate time various Senators will be making this point. I very much hope that when the point is made at the proper time, the Senators will very deeply consider this in a thoughtful way, because sometimes what you do in the short term, for short-term gratification, comes back and is harmful in the long run. I do think in this case it is better to think a little bit more about the purpose of the bill. 
   I thank the Senators for indulging me.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment proposed by Senator CRAPO, along with myself, Senator BURNS, and Senator CRAIG, to provide funding for the development of a habitat conservation plan for the recovery of the bull trout and other cold water fish in Montana and Idaho. 
   By way of background, the bull trout favors cold, high-mountain streams with lots of cover. Some are resident, remaining in the same tributary all year round. Most, however, are migratory, heading upstream spawn in the spring, when the water starts to get warm. 
   Historically, bull trout were found throughout the Northwest, from California to the Yukon Territory. Today, they are found primarily in Idaho and Montana. The Montana population is located in the Clark Fork River and in Lake Kookanusa, above the Libby Dam. 
   There are many reasons for the decline in the bull trout population, including timber harvesting, road building, farming and grazing, and dam construction. Ironically, efforts to help recover various salmon species in the lower part of the Columbia River system may actually have harmed the bull trout in the upper part of the system, by reducing water levels in the upper reservoirs. 
   In any event, in 1998, the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the bull trout as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. 
   For years, the State of Montana has been working hard to recover the bull trout. This work has intensified since the listing. For example, last year, Montana spent $568,000 on recovery efforts: things like improving stream channels, stabilizing stream banks, fencing, monitoring, educating anglers, and preventing poaching. But, to get the job done, we need to do more. And we need more help from the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   The amendment that we are offering today takes an important additional step. It sets aside $500,000, from the Fish and Wildlife Service budget, to help the states of Montana and Idaho develop a voluntary habitat conservation plan for the bull trout and other cold water fish, including the westslope cutthroat trout, for which a listing petition has been filed. 
   The idea of the HCP is to provide guidance, to small landowners, particularly owners of woodlots, farms, and ranches. For example, the HCP might set standards re-channelizing streams. Or for timber harvesting and road building to prevent sedimentation. Compliance will be completely voluntary, but landowners who follow the guidance will know that they are in full compliance with the Endangered Species Act. 
   This can encourage the kind of voluntary, cooperative efforts that can go a long way towards recovering the bull trout. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I spent the day at the Foote Ranch, along the Blackfoot River, in Ovando, in Northwest Montana. Geoff Foote and others were restoring Bull Trout habitat. Years ago, a stream had been straightened. This had the indirect effect of reducing the amount of mud that gathered along the sides of the stream, where bull trout spawn. So Geoff and others were re-channelizing the stream. 
   We cut logs, hauled them by horse, and placed the logs and large rocks so that the stream would meander and, by doing so, provide better bull spawning habitat. 
   It was a cooperative effort, involving folks from the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, local farmers and ranchers, and members of local environmental organizations. Our amendment will encourage further efforts, along these same lines. 
   The amendment does not modify the substantive provisions of the Endangered Species Act in any way. Nor does it implicate any of the controversies surrounding the standards for HCPs. 
   But it does provide funding to help Montana and Idaho continue their work to recover the bull trout. That's important, in it's own right. 
   Moreover, it will help our State highway programs. The listing of the bull trout has caused concern about the potential effect on highway construction. By providing clear guidance, the HCP should go a long way to ensuring that the bull trout and our highway programs both can thrive. 
   I commend the sponsor of the amendment, Senator CRAPO, the Chairman of the Fisheries, Wildlife, and Drinking Water Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his leadership on this issue. I also commend the other members of the delegation, Senators BURNS and CRAIG. I look forward to working further with them, Governors Racicot and Kempthorne, and Fish and Wildlife Service Director Clark to help recover the bull trout in Montana and Idaho in a reasonable, responsible way.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address recent developments in the world trading system that occurred over the past several days at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings. 
   Since its birth in 1989, APEC has been a useful forum to advance U.S. goals for world trade. In 1993, President Clinton hosted the first summit meeting of APEC leaders. That meeting helped to nudge the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to a successful conclusion. The following year, APEC leaders made a political commitment to free trade in the Pacific Basin by a date certain. Two years later, APEC leaders prodded WTO members to sign Information Technology Agreement. That agreement eliminates tariffs on products where U.S. companies have a clear advantage. 
   APEC has also launched some worthwhile projects aimed at making it easier to do business in the Pacific Rim. 
   The 21 members of APEC are responsible for almost half of the world's trade. They include country's at various stages of economic development. Members are as diverse as Papua New Guinea, Russia, Peru, and Australia. APEC is the only organization where China, Taiwan and Hong Kong sit together as equals to discuss economic issues. In 1998, U.S. trade with APEC members was just over one trillion dollars, about 70% of our trade. Our three biggest trading partners--Canada, Mexico and Japan--are in APEC 
   Last week in Auckland, New Zealand, APEC's trade and foreign ministers held their annual meeting. This was followed by the annual summit meeting of APEC leaders, including President Clinton. These meetings provided an opportunity for using APEC to further American trade interests in two ways. One was bilateral. It dealt with U.S.-China relations. The other was multilateral. It dealt with the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
   On the bilateral front, the annual APEC summit meeting provided President Clinton an opportunity to meet with China's President Jiang Zemin and get our relations with China on track. In particular, it was a chance to restart the talks on China's accession to the WTO. 
   To join the WTO, China must make one-way concessions in order to gain permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status. Before the China trade talks broke down for political reasons unrelated to trade, China made some important commitments to us in its accession protocol. For example, in addition to tariff cuts and agriculture concessions, China promised to eliminate technology transfer requirements for investment licenses. It will end investment performance requirements designed to take jobs from other countries. 
   China's WTO accession requires no American trade concessions. And China has agreed to a ``product-specific safeguard'' which will strengthen our ability to fight sudden import surges. A good accession protocol will be good for America. The Clinton-Jiang meeting in Auckland infused our bilateral trade talks with new life.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send a concurrent resolution establishing U.S. goals for the next round of global negotiations in the World Trade Organization to the desk. 
   In 1994, seven hard years of talks culminated the Uruguay Round Agreement creating the WTO. The United States can point with pride to the results of American leadership on trade. Among the agreement's notable results were beginning new countries into the rule-based trade regime; establishing an institution for ongoing trade talks and dispute resolution; and addressing some key issues for the first time. 
   The 1994 WTO agreement left unfinished business in two of these key issues: agriculture and services. WTO members committed to return to the table in January 2000 to address barriers in these sectors, the so-called ``built-in agenda.'' It will be a major challenge. Trade-distorting domestic agricultural programs are politically sensitive, especially in the European Union, the world's biggest offender in this area. In services, efforts to open up trade run into difficult questions of domestic regulation and investment. 
   Over the past several months, Mr. President, WTO members have submitted proposals for dealing with agriculture, services, and many other issues in a new global round of negotiations, to be launched in Seattle this November when the United States hosts the third WTO Ministerial Meeting. I have read some of these proposals, including the proposals submitted by the Administration, and I have compared them two what I hear from various groups around the country. 
   I have concluded that the U.S. proposals are timid and lack specificity. I am very concerned about this. We can't build a strong global economy without a strong set of trade rules. We can't address emerging issues such as biotechnology and electronic commerce, areas where the United States has a commanding lead, unless we supply a concrete vision of the future. We won't reach our goals unless we can state our goals clearly. We need a clear set of goals for this round of trade talks. The American people expect us to show leadership in this area. Our trading partners expect America to show leadership, too. 
   We in the Congress have a constitutional responsibility in this regard. The resolution I am submitting today fulfills our obligation by giving the Executive Branch specific goals for the upcoming round of negotiations. 
   Mr. President, I would like to summarize briefly the main points of this resolution. It deals not only with agriculture and services, but also with manufactured products, institutional concerns, and a variety of other trade-related issues. 
   AGRICULTURE
   America's farmers compete very effectively when world markets are not distorted by government intervention. Eliminating these distortions is not only good for the farm community, it will benefit U.S. consumers and our trading partners. It will stimulate demand for agricultural output, demand which American farmers are prepared to satisfy. My resolution instructs the Administration to seek elimination of export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic subsidies, to seek substantial tariff reductions, and for the first time to impose discipline on State Trading Enterprises. 
   SERVICES
   Services comprise almost three quarters of American output. We are a net exporter of services, so increased trade in services will have a positive effect on our current account balance. My resolution instructs the Administration to reach a global agreement that trade in services is free and open unless otherwise specified. The current system is that trade in services is closed unless otherwise specified. Starting from this principal of openness, the Administration should seek board participation in an agreement on services trade.,

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of Senators the retirement of Lieutenant General Patrick M. Hughes of the United States Army. A native of Great Falls Montana, I am proud that one of our native sons has made such a vital contribution to the defense of this great country, through a military career spanning nearly 40 years. 
   The recipient of many military awards and honors, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star, General Hughes has been a valuable friend to me and the people he has served in his distinguished career. 
   Although we have come to expect people of high caliber and dedication in our armed forces, General Hughes's service has been exceptional. Most recently assigned as the Director for Intelligence, J2, the Joint Staff, General Hughes began his military career in 1962. Following completion of his enlistment in 1965, he attended Montana State University, where he graduated in 1968. He was then commissioned in the U.S. Army infantry, and served two tours in Vietnam. He commanded several military intelligence (MI) detachments, an MI battalion, an MI brigade and the Army Intelligence Agency. He also served in senior staff positions, including a tour as the J2 of the U.S. Central Command. 
   Throughout his distinguished career, General Hughes's tireless and sincere  dedication to the men and women in uniform has vastly improved their quality of life and mission readiness. As he retires from the United States Army, he will leave behind a tremendous legacy. 
   Mr. President, General Hughes is a great credit to the Army and the Nation. I salute him for his many years of selfless service to our country, and offer my gratitude to him, his wife Karlene and their sons, Barry and Chad, on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Army. I know I speak for the people of my state when I say that I am proud of General Hughes; I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that he will be missed.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the adoption of the Conference Report to accompany S. 507, The Water Resources Development Act of 1999, WRDA. 
   As we all know, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998 passed this Chamber last year, but was never enacted. This Conference Report builds upon the work done on that legislation and includes some additional projects and programs for the Army Corps of Engineers. With the adoption of this conference report, we wrap up some unfinished business from the 105th Congress and are back on course for development of a Water Resources Development Act for 2000.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I very much thank my good friend from New York. 
   In a couple of years when the Senator is no longer here, we will miss him very much. I know of no Senator more provocative, in the best sense of the term, in forcing Members to think. That is something which too often is in short commodity on the floor of the Senate. I very much thank my friend.  
   This is a strange debate. I heard earlier my good friend from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, say he is bewildered. I myself have referred to this debate as surreal. My friend from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, asked: What are we talking about? Why are we here? 
   Those are apt comments in many ways. 
   One, because we know this bill will be vetoed. We know this tax cut that has been proposed is not going to happen. Yet both those who favor the tax cut and those who favor a veto are trying to score political points with the American people. There are a lot of games being played around here. I don't think that is any news to the American people. They know what is going on. They are pretty smart. 
   It is similar to President Lincoln saying you can fool some of the people some of the time but you can't fool all the people all the time. 
   The American people are smarter than the Congress thinks they are. 
   Let me go through some of the reasons. First, the assumptions behind this big tax cut are unrealistic and we all know they are unrealistic. I daresay that many on the other side of the aisle would agree privately with our public statements on this side of the aisle that the assumptions are unrealistic. There is no way in the world the Congress will jeopardize national defense by cutting national defense a couple hundred billion over the next decade. There is no way in the world the Congress is going to hurt veterans by dramatically cutting veterans' benefits. There is no way in the world the Congress is going to cut education and do all that is assumed behind this tax cut. Yet virtually the entire projected surplus we are spending in this bill is based upon exactly these things happening. That is one reason this is a surreal, unrealistic, illusionary, and strange debate. It is not based upon facts. 
   As others have pointed out, much more persuasively than I, the numbers of this tax cut as proposed do not add up. There is no way in the world we will be able to cut taxes $800 billion, pay the additional interest on the debt, and provide for a modicum of services that people need. Some have suggested--and nobody has disputed this number--that this tax cut will require about a $600 billion cut in spending over the next 10 years. It is unrealistic. It is not right. It is wrong to attempt to fool the American people that these levels of cuts are good for the country. 
   Beyond that, this bill is based upon such ephemeral, illusionary projections, it baffles me that anybody could stand on the floor and say it is necessarily going to happen--that we will have a $1 trillion budget surplus from tax revenues over the next 10 years. Past projections have been so far off the mark that it is foolish to assume this projection will be accurate. 
   On average, our projections are about 13 percent off the mark over 5 years. This is a 10-year projection. I point out that CBO, the agency on which we base our projections, stated in January of this year they were off $200 billion when they came up with their midcourse review in July of this year. The projections were $200 billion off over a period of just 6 months. Who knows how far off a 10 year projection could be? If we are honest with ourselves, we know most people are concerned that the economy is now overheated, rather than underheated, and therefore the projections will probably fall off and we will have much less of a budget surplus than we assume. 
   I point this out because it defies common sense that we lock in law tax cuts far out in the future based on these very flimsy assumptions. Why are we doing that? 
    Most people wouldn't do that. Most people, putting their family budgets together, wouldn't do that. Certainly no business would do that. No business would assume that its revenues 10 years out were going to be absolutely a certain amount and therefore they are going to spend all this money today. You just cannot make that assumption. You have to be prudent. 
   I talked to the CEO of a major company just last week. I asked him how their company makes projections. 
   He said: We cannot. We try to make a 5-year projection, but we are always way off. The best we can do is we put together a 5-year plan and try to anticipate what the future is going to be like, but we are constantly modifying it because times are changing so quickly. 
   I think that probably makes sense. That is what we should be doing. We should not lock in tax cuts so far out. Rather, if we think tax cuts make some sense, they should be modest, to leave room for corrections if we have made a mistake. 
   Times do change very much. So, again, I say this bill is reckless. It is based on an illusion. It is just not prudent. I say to the American people, I hope you understand how imprudent all this is. 
   I must also make another point, and this point saddens me. We are in this strange, surreal situation, in part because there is so much partisanship in this body as well as in the other body. When I first came to the Senate about 20 years ago, I must say there was much less partisanship then than there is now. It is just too partisan now. 
   By that I mean the other side of the aisle is totally controlling and secretive in what they are doing. They have put together their tax bill on their own; behind closed doors. No Democratic Senators were allowed. The same with the conference report; behind closed doors, on their own, with no Democratic Senator allowed. 
   Not too many years ago when the Democrats were in the majority, both sides were included in drafting bills, both Republicans and Democrats. I think that is what the American people want. They want us to work together. They really do not care whether we are Republicans or Democrats; they really care that all 100 of us sit down, do the best we can, and recognize this is a democracy with different States, and different people who have different points of view, but achieve some rough justice and rough common sense. 
   I think there is a reason for the secrecy. There is a reason for the closed doors; that is, they can do things they know are not right, things that could not stand the light of day. If the doors were open and if both sides of the aisle were included, we would not have such phony budget projections. By ``phony'' I mean in the last couple of weeks, the other side directed CBO to come up with some new numbers based upon their own new assumptions to fit the conclusions they wanted. 
   What was the conclusion they wanted? The conclusion they wanted was to show we could cut taxes by $800 billion and still come up with $400 billion or $500 billion in spending revenue. 
   CBO said, ``No, you cannot do that,'' before. So the other side said, ``Just change some assumptions around so you can reach that conclusion.'' That is what they did. They did it privately. In fact, they distributed that chart on their side. They didn't even distribute it on this side because they knew, if we looked at it, we could probably find out how erroneous it was, how fallacious it was. We finally did. 
   I very much lament the secrecy and partisanship which is producing this product. I guess what bothers me most is, when I ran for the Senate and I think when most of us sought this office and were privileged enough to get elected, we came here because we wanted to address the major, big problems facing this country. We are not doing that. We are poised to move into the next century, 
   the next millennium. Who are we as Americans? What do we want? What is our role in the world?

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend. 
   Who are we? How much do we want to spend on defense? What is our role in the Far East? Who are we as a country? What about countries like Bosnia and Yugoslavia? How much should we spend there? What is our role there? What is the proper role of Government? Not the false debate that is set up here--turn the money back or don't turn the money back. That is a vacuous, vacant, insipid argument. It is so simple-minded. That argument avoids asking the real questions. Questions like what is the proper level of government, what taxes should be collected from where, how and when should we stimulate the private sector? Let's have a real honest debate on policy, not a phony debate on politics. 
   This has been a phony debate on politics, this last week, on this tax bill. It  has not been an honest debate on public policy, on what is right, on what the right levels of spending should be. It is not based upon the same set of numbers, the same facts. Everybody comes up with his own charts, his own different facts. 
   You know the old saying: Liars figure and figures lie. We cannot even agree on the same baseline. We can't agree on the same facts. By definition, we are just talking past each other. I guess that is what bothers me most and that is why I think this whole debate is most unreal and why it is sad. It is, in a large sense, not only a waste of time because we are not addressing the points that should be addressed, but it is a disservice to the American people. 
   I very much hope in the next month, in September and next year, the leadership on both sides of the aisle will work harder to put politics aside and the Senators themselves will work hard to put politics aside. I know that might sound like a political statement, but it is what I believe. In every ounce of my body, I believe it because that is why we are here and that is what we should be doing. 
   I very much hope after the President vetoes this bill, either there is no bill so we can start all over again, or we can come together in some appropriate way so we can get down to the real issues that face this country.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Community Open Space Bonds Act of 1999 with my colleague, the senior Senator from Utah. This bill is designed to give state and local governments more resources to protect open space, preserve water quality, and redevelop brownfield sites. It provides communities with zero-cost financing options for those activities in an entirely voluntary and locally-driven way. There is no Federal land-use planning involved. 
   The demand for these kinds of community-protection and quality of life activities is plain to see. Open space ballot initiatives in last year's elections were hugely successful. States and local governments set aside nearly $7.5 billion over the next several years to deal with environmental issues raised by growth. Smart growth planning ideas are sweeping the nation. States are steering their investments to preserving open space and encouraging smarter development. 
   These ideas are coming straight from state and local officials and community leaders. People are discussing how they want their communities to look and feel for the first time in decades. Last fall, a state-wide conference in my home state entitled ``Big Sky or Big Sprawl'' brought together Montanans from all over the state to exchange ideas on how to prepare for growth and keep our state ``the last best place.'' 
   This new attention to the impacts of growth is happening for many reasons. Some claim that transportation planning has not kept up with communities' needs for choices and access, causing congestion and lost productivity. Some say that building codes and subdivision regulations have encouraged the development of agricultural and open space areas at the expense of existing suburbs. Some maintain that the tax code drives development in outlying areas while urban and downtown business districts fail. Others suggest that the Federal government's policies on location of post offices and Federal offices has pushed growth out of small and large cities alike. 
   Whatever the cause, growth is exploding across the land. For instance, Los Angeles' land use grew by 300 percent between 1970 and 1990, while population grew by only 45 percent. In the same period, Cleveland actually lost 11 percent of its population, but grew by 33 percent in size. 
   The problem is not growth per se, but the inefficient way that current growth is using today's infrastructure. Some cities like Bozeman, Montana, have had to resort to impact assessment fees in the outlying areas so that the established city's system would not have to subsidize growth away from the already built up areas. The challenge is to encourage growth while maintaining open space and other factors that make our communities desirable places to live and work. 
   Because of our quality of life in the West, people are moving there in droves. We pride ourselves on having lots of space and we want growth. 
   But, growth in environmentally sensitive and water restricted areas poses some unique problems. We have vast amounts of public land that are getting harder and harder to access as growth crowds these areas. That means fewer hunters, fishermen, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts, can use these lands easily. 
   One result of this growth is that the character of the West is changing rapidly. For instance, Montana grew faster than the rest of the nation in the 1990s. That rate of growth, especially when it is concentrated in a small number of areas, concerns people. They start turning to their state and local government representatives for action to preserve the character of their communities. 
   A recent poll showed that most Americans believe that government at all levels could do a better job of protecting and creating parks and conserving open space. That same poll showed that they are willing to pay for such programs and that they view these programs as a relatively high priority. Leaders at all levels of government should heed these results. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is intended to help address this need. We want to give communities the flexible resources they need to creatively manage growth-related problems at the local level.  
   In developing the Community Open Space Bonds Act of 1999, we started with the proposal included in the Administration's FY2000 budget request. We have improved upon it to make it more responsive to local needs and to be equitable in its treatment of small and Western communities. 
   However, the basic idea is still the same. States and local governments, including tribal governments, can compete for the authority to issue bonds on which the Federal government will pay the interest costs. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds can be used to acquire open space, build parks, protect water quality, improve access to public lands and redevelop brownfield areas. Up to $1.9 billion in bonding authority could be issued over each of the next five years. The Federal government would pay the interest costs by giving bondholders a tax credit against their income at the corporate AA credit rate. 
   Rather than having Federal agencies making all the decisions about who gets bonding authority, we are establishing a Community Open Space Bonds Board. This Board will be dominated by non-Federal interest, such as Governors, County Commissioners, Mayors, etc. and will be given specific guidance to use in developing application criteria. This guidance will stress the need for an equitable distribution of bonding authority to all regions of the country and to all sizes of communities and for all the different qualifying purposes. We have also guaranteed that each state or a community in such a state will get at least one allocation of bonding authority per year. 
   We think these modifications improve the original proposal and are worthy of support by our colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We stand ready to work with them to address their concerns and get this bill enacted. 
   Mr. President, local governments across the country are looking for new and low-cost ways to maintain and preserve the quality of life in their area. Community Open Space Bonds are a great opportunity for all our citizens to improve the long term health and economic viability of our communities. I am hopeful we can pursue this opportunity in a bipartisan and constructive way.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that S. 1233, the Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY2000 does not include adequate funding for carbon cycle or carbon sequestration research. The Administration has proposed approximately $22 million for these programs at the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agriculture Research Service (ARS). With that money, scientists can develop a better understanding of the potential for agricultural lands to serve as carbon sinks. These programs are priorities in the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Administration's Climate Change Technology Initiative. 
   Once we more thoroughly understand how our soils capture and store carbon, we can use that knowledge to improve our management practices and yields. We can also cost-effectively use soils to offset carbon emissions that might lead to global warming. Failure to provide these funds is short-sighted and may prevent farmers and ranchers from reaping profits through storing carbon on their land in the near future. 
   Agricultural lands in the U.S. have a huge potential to store carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Each year, the U.S. emits about 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTC) or gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. According to USDA experts, properly managed U.S. croplands could be major sinks or reservoirs of carbon. They could sequester, or store, 85-200 MMTC more per year than the agriculture sector does now. If a coordinated program to manage carbon in agricultural soils were implemented worldwide, some experts project that carbon sequestration could increase to the rate of 3000 MMTC per year. This rate is equal to the world's net annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
   Mr. President, about 25-30% of our nation's farmers, growers and ranchers are already employing best management practices which will effectively store carbon, so farmers and ranchers would not need to adopt radically new production techniques to store carbon. Most find these practices very cost-effective for their bottom-line because  the land rewards them for their attention. There are higher yields with increased carbon storage, less erosion, and improved soil and water quality. As an example, adoption of conservation tillage and residue management practices could lock up about .2 metric tons of carbon per acre every year. 
   Eventually, as actions by some of our major trading partners are now demonstrating, there is likely to be a worldwide market in carbon credit trading, regardless of what happens to the Kyoto Treaty in this country. This is a terrific economic opportunity. As we discuss the sorry state of American agriculture and the family farm in the context of this bill, we should keep in mind that soil carbon storage could become a very lucrative opportunity to maintain income levels. Experts are projecting that carbon credits will sell for somewhere between $10-$50 per ton and maybe higher. So, a farmer using best management practices on his 1000 acres could possibly get payments of $2,000-$10,000 or more per year for storing carbon. 
   Mr. President, the very modest sums that the Administration is seeking for these programs are not to implement Kyoto through some back-door method. There are legitimate scientific questions that need to be answered whether or not one believes Kyoto is necessary. Understanding soil science better will improve crop yields, make range management more efficient, and provide a host of environmental quality benefits. This knowledge will benefit all those who produce food and fiber. 
   I should note for my colleagues that there will be a national conference to explore opportunities for carbon sequestration in Missoula, Montana, from October 26-28. The purpose of this conference is to provide information and education on carbon sequestration activities to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through market-based conservation. 
   Many of the experts that will speak at this conference are scientists whose work would be furthered if Congress funds the Administration's request. The efforts of the Montana Carbon Offset Coalition to establish a pilot carbon trading program would also be helped along by funding these programs. 
   Mr. President, there are many pressing needs facing Congress and, in particular, the managers of the Agriculture Appropriations bill. I just think that we should make investing in our future a priority. Soils seem to be a great low-cost way for us to reduce the impact our country has on the global climate. Even for those who do not believe climate change is happening due to mankind's emissions, increasing soil carbon content has huge side benefits for the economy and the environment. I hope the managers will find a way to fund these important programs in conference.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a lot of us have listened quite intently, and some of us not very intently, to the debate. Very simply, cutting to the chase, the question before us is whether to adopt an agriculture emergency assistance bill in the amount of roughly $10 billion--$10.6 billion, I think--that is proposed by Members essentially on this side of the aisle, or, in the alternative, a bill that is about half that much. 
   The main difference between the two is not only the amount, but also the failure, in my judgment, of the bill on the other side to provide drought assistance. It is emergency drought assistance. We have all watched on television in the last several days how dry so much of America is and how farmers' crops are not growing and are not going to be harvested. In some parts of the country, it is not only drought; paradoxically, strangely, it is flooding. There is too much moisture in some parts of the country, making it impossible for farmers to grow a productive crop. 
   Compounding that, there is a very low price. According to the wheat producers and barley producers, livestock, hogs--you name it--the prices are just rock bottom, and they have been very low for a long time. So it is a combination of very low prices, historically low prices, for some commodities, and the weather. 
   The outlook is not good. The outlook for increased prices in the basic commodities we are talking about, as well as livestock, is grim. Nobody can project or foresee a solid, sound reason why prices necessarily are going to go up in the next several years. 
   What conditions are going to cause prices to go up? What is going to change or be different? To be truthful, there isn't much we can see that is going to be much different. Producers are going to still produce. Other countries, particularly emerging and developing countries, are going to try to produce more agricultural products than they now are producing. On top of that, there is the phenomenon of a growing concentration of economic power in the beef packing industry, or in the grain trade, where the middlemen, if you will--that is, the traders, the packing plants, and retailers--are making money but the producers are not. That is not going to change in the foreseeable future. At least I don't see anything that will cause that change. 
   So, essentially, we are here today because farmers are getting deeper and deeper and deeper in trouble. Their prices are continually falling. I hope my colleagues took a good look at the chart presented by my good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN--the one that showed in current dollars what the price of wheat was in 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960. The current price of wheat in today's dollars is roughly $2 a bushel. Back in 1930, in current dollars, adjusted for inflation, it was about $7.50 a bushel. In 1940 and in 1950--I have forgotten the chart, but I think it was as high as maybe $13 or $14 a bushel. 
   You can see how the price generally has declined over the years for farmers, and it has declined greatly. This is not just a minor drop in price. It is a precipitous drop in price. It is steady. It is constant. 
   As I said, I can't see much that is going to cause a significant difference unless we in the Congress and in the country make the changes, which I will get to in a few minutes. 
   On the other hand, the prices that farmers pay for their products over the same period of time have risen dramatically-- whether it is the prices the farmers pay for fertilizer, for gasoline, for tractors or combines, for fencing, or for labor costs. You name it. 
   All of the costs that farmers pay have continually risen to a very steep trend over the past 20 or 30 years since the Depression, and at the same time prices that farmers get for their products generally have fallen, although there was a period several years ago where prices were high--$5, $6, or $7 a bushel. That was about 5, 6, 7, or 8 years ago, as I recall. But generally the trend is down. 
   Why has this happened? It has happened for a couple of reasons: One, many more countries are producing products--wheat, barley, and so on and so forth. Second, as I mentioned, the concentration of economic power in the retail industry, in the wholesale industry, and in the packing industry, but not a concentration of power for the farmers. 
   On top of that, recently there is the Asian downturn where the Asian economies a couple of years ago began to deteriorate. Their purchasing power dropped dramatically. They devalued their currencies in order to try to prop themselves up. As a consequence, American exports to Asia fell dramatically--in combination with the low demand, particularly from Asia, and the higher supply, particularly in countries producing and, on top of that, the drought and too much rain in some parts of the country. 
   So we are here today to try to decide what the size of the emergency assistance should be. 
   I submit that we should not only make the direct payments to farmers but we also should accommodate the drought. We should accommodate the farm disaster that has beset the farmers in addition to the economic disaster. 
   That is just a short-term, immediate solution. We should get on it right away, and we should get it passed this week, lock, stock, and barrel--all of it passed this week to give farmers a little bit of hope. 
   Then, to begin to give farmers a little more hope for the future, we have to pass a modification to the so-called Freedom to Farm bill. We have to pass a new farm bill. 
   I remember when Freedom to Farm was debated. Most farmers I talked to in my home State of Montana were very leery and very nervous about this Freedom to Farm bill. A lot of them--I daresay a majority of them--went along with it because at that time prices were a little higher. As I recall, it was about one-plus a bushel. The so-called AMTA payments were a little higher. There was more money in farmers' pockets. But farmers knew--the ones I talked to, and I talked to a  whole bunch of them--that we would get on with it then, but on down the road there was going to be a real problem, and probably times were not going to be nearly as good as they were then. But we kind of swept that problem under the rug and thought we would cross that bridge when we got there. 
   We are there. It has happened. We are in trouble. Farmers know it. So let's just get this thing passed. But we very quickly have to begin to address the peaks and the valleys in the prices that farmers face. 
   I would like to remind folks in the cities that farmers are in a much different situation from most any other business person because farmers cannot control their price. The price is determined by the vagaries of the market, the vagaries of weather, and it is international; it is an international price in most cases. They have virtually no control over their prices. Take any other businessperson. He or she can raise or lower their prices to sell to retailers or to sell to consumers. There are ways to adjust to help maximize their return. 
   Moreover, farmers cannot control their costs. They have to pay what that farm implement dealer charges. They have to pay what that fertilizer costs. They just have to pay that price. They have virtually no control over their costs. Any other businessperson has a lot of control over his or her costs--either by downsizing, laying a few people off here or there, making other adjustments, or cutbacks. Big businesses can certainly make big adjustments to costs, and have, with major downsizing. The farmer can't do that. The farmer has no control over costs and virtually no control over prices. 
   That is why we have to have some kind of legislation that evens out the peaks and valleys and gives farmers a modicum of a safety net. We need that desperately, and, for the sake of farmers, we need to get that passed. 
   One final point: This is a subject for a later day. But we need a level international playing field. We do not have it today. I give a lot of credit to our USTR, to the administration, and to others who have worked to try to make it more level. They have worked harder, if the truth be known, than other administrations have. We are nowhere close to the position where we have to be. 
   I will mention two subjects, and then I will close. One is export subsidies. We need an end to world export subsidies for agriculture. They have to be eliminated. 
   Today the European Union accounts for about 86 percent of all the world's agricultural export subsidies. We Americans account for about 1 to 2 percent. 
   Europeans have 60 times the agricultural export subsidies that we have. That is a very great distortion of the market. Agricultural export subsidies are paid to European farmers if they export. What is the farmer going to do in Europe? He exports. He gets a subsidy for it--and a big, healthy subsidy for it. That is to say nothing about all the internal price supports the Europeans have that are much greater than ours. 
   The ministerial in Seattle begins at the end of this year. As we approach the next WTO, one of our main objectives, one of our main goals should be the total elimination of agricultural export subsidies. That is going to help. That is going to help reduce the worldwide supply just a little bit. And every little bit helps. I have a lot of other ideas about what we can do as well, but that is one that is very critical. 
   Point No. 2: In general, on the WTO, there are a lot of things we have to do to level the playing field so that Americans are no longer suckers and taken for granted to the degree that we have been. 
   But to sum it all up, let's pass this agriculture emergency aid bill immediately. Let's pass the bill that makes sense, the one that helps farmers. And that is the one that not only puts some money back into farmers' pockets for the short term but also addresses the drought, which the other bill does not address. It addresses the disaster caused in some parts of the country by excessive flooding and rain. 
   Really, what is happening is that the farmer is in intensive care. The farmer needs an oxygen mask, and the farmer needs a blood transfusion. That is where we are. We have to give the farmer the oxygen mask. We have to give the farmer the blood transfusion so that the farmer is no longer in intensive care. 
   That oxygen mask and that blood transfusion is this bill. It is the bill that is sponsored by the Democratic leader and the Senator from Iowa. That is the bill that is going to take care to get that patient back out of intensive care. The next step, which we have to take very soon, is to get that patient rehabilitated and get that patient some physical therapy. It will take some other procedures in the hospital so that the farmer can compete in the real world as a real person again. I hope we get to that point very quickly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the relationship between trade and the environment. 
   When I joined the Finance Committee in 1979, debate about the Tokyo Round was just concluding. I don't remember a single mention of water pollution, air pollution, or the protection of sea turtles and other endangered species--important issues, but they were not part of the trade debate. 
   NAFTA changed this. We negotiated the environmental side agreement, and created the North America Commission on Environmental Cooperation. There were flaws and limitations, but it was a turning point. 
   Now, like it or not, environmental issues are an integral part of the trade debate. Environmental group opposition was one of the major reasons for the defeat of Fast Track legislation last year. Ambassador Barshefsky has said that the next round of trade negotiations should expressly address environmental protection. Two months ago, the WTO held a series of high level roundtable discussions on trade and the environment, in part to help define the issues for consideration in Seattle. 
   Why has this happened? 
   It is partly a function of technology. Environmental groups have plugged into the Internet--aggressively. Browse the web sites of almost any environmental group, and you will see what I mean. Any citizen can follow a high-level environmental trade dispute on the Internet. The heretofore insulated, inaccessible, and arcane international trade world meets the chaotic, grassroots, democratic, and Internet-savvy environmental world. 
   Let me tell my friends in the trade world something about my friends in the environmental world. I have worked with them for years. Sometimes on the same side, sometimes in disagreement. They are smart, dedicated, energetic, and aggressive. And they are very good at using the latest communications technology. So, if you are uncomfortable with the new role of the environmental community in the trade debate, my only advice is: Get used to it and figure out how to work together. The same advice goes to my environmental friends: The trade folks are here to stay. Figure out how to work with them. 
   There's a second important reason why environmental protection is now an important part of the trade debate. 
   We are in the midst of an economic boom in the United States and the revolution of globalization. Globalization is bringing every classroom in every  small western town, and on every Native American reservation, smack into the middle of the information-based global marketplace. It allows small businesses all over the world to tap into the global marketplace. It's forcing virtually every company to become more competitive. 
   But there's another side to the story. Call it the dark side of globalization. And it has a long history. 
   America's age of industrialization created great wealth and progress. But it left behind a terrible environmental legacy. Rivers so infected with toxic chemicals that they caught fire. Abandoned mine tailings that dot the landscape of the mountainous 
   west. The loss of wetlands and other habitat necessary to sustain the animal and plant species upon which our survival depends. 
   In America, we have turned the tide. Our air and water are cleaner now. But we have seen what unchecked economic development did to us. 
   Extend that kind of growth worldwide. And pick up the pace, to reflect the hyper-speed of global competition. As globalization accelerates, along with the expanded trade that accompanies and fuels it, we are likely to see a rapid increase in environmental problems. 
   Tom Friedman puts it this way, in The Lexus and the Olive Tree:  
   [globalization has] unleashed forest-crushing forces of development ..... which, if left unchecked, [has] the potential to destroy the environment and uproot cultures, at a pace never before seen in human history.  
   Let me give you two examples. 
   For years, Montanan and other U.S. softwood lumber producers have been fighting against subsidized Canadian imports. One continuing issue is Canada's relatively weak environmental standards for timber harvesting. Canada has no law, at the federal or provincial level, like our Endangered Species Act. 
   This gives Canadian producers an economic advantage over U.S. producers. It also can have a serious environmental effect. In Montana, we're struggling to protect the Bull Trout, which is listed as an endangered species. One of the biggest populations resides in Lake Kookanusa, just south of the Canadian border. In the spring, the fish swim up Wigwam Creek, across the border in British Columbia, to spawn. 
   Recently, British Columbia announced a program of aggressive timber harvesting in the Wigwam Basin. Maybe things will work out, and the harvesting will occur in a way that does not threaten the Bull Trout. But, if not, our efforts to protect an endangered species in this country will be undermined because of another developed country's environmental laws that are deliberately weak to support an industry interest. 
   Or consider the objectives of the Endangered Species Act which includes preserving biodiversity, the web of life that sustains us. We're losing species at an alarming speed--perhaps a thousand times the natural rate. 
   No matter how strictly we protect species here in the United States, if the South American rain forest continues to disappear at the current rate, all of our efforts will have been futile. 
   The message is simple. Globalization and expanded trade benefit us. But we must ensure that globalization and expanded trade are conducted in a way that enhances, and does not undermine, environmental protection. 
   One thing that worries my greatly is the polarization that has occurred among participants in the trade and environment debate. The middle ground seems to have fallen into a sink hole. Yet the middle is where we need people to find solutions to these very difficult problems. 
   Let's turn to the next round of multilateral trade negotiations that will be the subject of the WTO Ministerial in Seattle in late November. We must accommodate globalization and expanded trade while, at the same time, preserve and enhance environmental protection. 
   America must lead. We are the world's largest economy. We are the world's largest trader. And we are the world's leader in developing strong environmental laws. As in many different areas, if we don't exert leadership, no one else will. This is not arrogance. This is not unilateralism. This is leadership, and I offer no excuses and no apologies for it. 
   I believe that we must follow three broad precepts in developing the proper linkage between trade and the environment. Call these my ``Three No's''. 
   Trade liberalization must not harm the environment: Trade rules must not be used to stop legitimate and reasonable environmental protection; Environmental regulations must not be used as an instrument for trade protection that closes markets and distorts trade flows. 
   We need to balance trade and environmental goals and prevent trade and environmental abuses. So, let me turn to my agenda for trade and the environment in the next round of trade negotiations. 
   First, the WTO dispute resolution process must be made more open, transparent and publicly accessible. This is important in the context of environmental law and regulation, which relies heavily on citizen suits and the public's right to know. And it is important in the context of the WTO's credibility. Secrecy does not enhance respect and confidence in institutions. 
   The GATT was created in an era when nation-states were the only significant actors on the world scene. The WTO followed the same structure. But it does not reflect today's reality where non-governmental entities have become important international and national players. The rules and procedures must accommodate these new actors. 
   The dispute settlement process takes too much time and must be shortened significantly. Loopholes that allow delay in complying with decisions must be closed. 
   Second, the Administration must conduct an environmental assessment for the trade agreement that will emerge from the new round. I will introduce legislation soon requiring such a review. 
   Third, we should eliminate all tariffs on environmental goods and services. One important way to improve environmental conditions in other countries, especially in developing countries, is to reduce the cost of environmental technology--everything from the elements of a sewage treatment plant to catalytic converters to groundwater bioremediation technology. U.S. companies are leaders in this field, so reduced tariffs will have the added advantage of increasing U.S. exports. 
   My fourth item involves environmentally harmful subsidies. In some cases, like fishing and agriculture, excessive subsidies lead to practices that are both economically and environmentally harmful. By limiting such subsidies, we can achieve a ``win-win,'' that makes good economic and good environmental sense. I would like to see the total elimination of fishing subsidies. Export subsidies for agriculture should be eliminated worldwide. We should also start looking seriously into the reduction of domestic agricultural subsidies throughout the world. 
   The fifth item relates to other subsidies--the so-called ``pollution subsidy'' where intentionally keeping environmental standards weak can be an unfair and unacceptable practice that distorts trade, cuts costs of production for the polluter, and makes taxpayers pay the difference through higher health and environmental cleanup costs. 
   A sub-set of this problem is that of PPMs--production processes and methods. How a product is produced affects the environment. Examples include the way shrimp harvesting affects 
   sea turtles, and the way timber harvesting affects species, water pollution, and the demand for recycled materials. 
   These are complex issues. Some argue that the WTO has already accepted the principle that a production process can determine how a product should be treated. They point out that countries already determine if an imported product was made with improperly obtained intellectual property or with improper government subsidies. If so, those countries can prevent the import of that good because of the process of production. They argue that if this is the rule under the WTO for intellectual property and for subsidies abuses, it should be the rule for environmental processes as well. 
   The WTO needs to take on this set of tough issues that sits clearly at the intersection of trade and the environment. We need serious and responsible discussion now.  
   Sixth, the environmental community believes that we need to find a way to integrate multilateral trade agreements and multilateral environmental agreements, MEAs, and they are right. Actions taken under an MEA should not be subject to a GATT challenge. There are two ways to go about this. One is to ``grandfather'' specific environmental agreements, as we did in NAFTA. We could start out by providing a so-called ``safe haven'' for the Montreal Protocol and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The other is to describe the characteristics of an MEA that will automatically be protected. 
   Let me add a few other agenda items that are unrelated to my Seattle list but need to be on our ``to do'' list in the United States. 
   First, we should take a hard look at the NAFTA environmental side agreement, and see how it is working. I will ask the key Congressional Committees, including the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, to conduct appropriate oversight. 
   Second, we need to improve our domestic trade policy institutions. And that includes enhancing the role of Congress in trade negotiations. Last week, in a speech at the Washington International Trade Association, I proposed the establishment of a Congressional Trade Office. This office would provide the Congress with additional independent, non-partisan, neutral trade expertise. 
   Its functions would include: monitoring compliance with major bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements; analysis of Administration trade policy, trade actions, and proposed trade legislation; participation in dispute settlement deliberations at the WTO and NAFTA, and evaluation of the results of dispute settlement cases involving the United States. 
   The National Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club have proposed such an office, although the functions in my concept are quite different. 
   I will be offering legislation on this later this year. 
   One of the most difficult issues that has arisen in recent years has been the relationship between trade policy and environmental protection. The lack of consensus on this relationship has been one of the major reasons that we have not been able to proceed with fast track legislation in the Congress. 
   Paralysis helps no one. I hope that the thoughts I have set out today for Seattle and for our own domestic agenda will help to begin a constructive and responsible dialogue between the trade and the environmental communities. We need trade. We need environmental protection. We need a sustainable earth, and that means a clean world and a growing world--more and better jobs everywhere, increased income, cleaner air and water, the protection of our natural heritage for future generations. These goals are only incompatible when people are unwilling to talk about them together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I again compliment my good friend, the Senator from Texas, as well as the chairman of the committee. The Senator from Texas offered this amendment last night, and at that time I explained we thought this was a very good amendment because it moves in the direction of the Democratic substitute, raising the standard deduction, in her case for married couples, to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We would have gone further, but we compliment the Senator in going in this direction. 
   Last night, too, there was a slight question how this was going to be paid for. We have worked it out overnight. As I understand it--the Senator may correct me if I am wrong--the AMT delayed relief provisions are no longer in place, but rather there will be a delay in the expansion of the 15-percent bracket in order to pay for this.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with great respect, I must inform this body that this amendment is pure fiction. It is pure fiction because the House and the Senate this year have been using Congressional Budget Office baseline numbers to predict what the surplus is or is not and what is left for spending. Under that formula, there is virtually no money in this tax bill left for discretionary spending. 
   A few days ago, a new chart suddenly popped up. The new chart comes up with this money. How does it come up with this money? It basically assumes that the Congress, over the next 10 years, is going to not only cut discretionary spending under the caps as planned but then not raise discretionary spending above inflation over the next 8 years. 
   I say that is a fiction--it is just not going to happen, so the money is not there--developed by this recent new chart. 
   If it is an accurate assumption that there is no spending, then it cuts discretionary spending by 50 percent, one or the other. It is a fiction.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have not seen a copy of this amendment, but I assume it is the standard flat tax that has been discussed for years. If that is the case, then the net effect of it will be, for most income earners, most American taxpayers, in effect, a tax increase. The only taxpayers with a tax reduction under the standard flat tax proposal will be those of adjusted gross incomes of over $200,000, and the tax reduction will be 50 percent. Stated differently, this is a tax on workers but it is not a tax on investment income, it is not a tax on other income, which I think is unfair. 
   In any event, the amendment is not germane. I raise a point of order that it violates section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very simple matter before the Senate. It is a choice: Do we want to protect Medicare or not. It is that simple. That is the choice that we are presented with today. 
   The amendment I am offering is the House lockbox which passed the House by an overwhelming margin--it only had three or four votes against it--along with the Medicare lockbox. The Medicare lockbox we provide sets aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. It can be used in whatever way we want to use it for Medicare, including to provide an affordable prescription drug benefit or for shoring up Medicare solvency. 
   That is the choice before the Senate. Do we preserve Medicare or not. Our choice here today, however, is nothing compared to another choice. That is the choice that about 16 million seniors must make every day: Do I choose to buy my medicine, choose to pay the rent, or choose to buy food? 
   We are saying set aside and preserve for Medicare one-third of the on-budget surplus so that the choices facing seniors are not quite as abhorrent.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   The Finance Committee has already rejected this provision. The Finance Committee deliberated this amendment in committee, and, by a large margin turned it down because it is excessive. It is irresponsible, in my judgment. It is not the right thing to do. It says we are going to take the entire on-budget surplus. And because of the tax cut plus the lost interest on the debt, there is nothing left for Medicare, discretionary spending or any other programs which will be cut anyway by a very large margin. 
   It is excessive, too, compared to the bill passed by the committee because it is so backloaded. It is so top heavy. By that, I mean the bulk of the cost of the provisions are at the very end--6, 7, or 8 years from now. No one can predict the future of this country and what position we will be in 6 to 8 years from now. 
   I was speaking to the CEO of a major American company a few days ago, a man we all know, a company we all know very well. He told me they can't begin to plan for the future. They do have 5-year plans but they know the 5-year plans are not going to be accurate. 
   So they have to just do the best they can on virtually a quarterly basis. They have to go ahead in the areas they think are the areas of the future, but it is almost impossible to plan in this modern era. 
   So I say, if we today were to lock in provisions in the law which will hemorrhage this country's budget surplus based upon ephemeral, distant projections which are never accurate, that is not responsible. That is not the right thing to do. And that is what this amendment does. That is why basically, fundamentally, without going into all the details of it, why this does not make sense. It has often been stated during this debate that the time when the baby boomers begin to retire is when these things really start to kick in and the costs explode. 
   I think prudence is the watchword here today. History sometimes is a guide. Look at the 1980s. What happened in the 1980s? There was a huge tax cut. Congress succumbed to the siren song of supply side economics. What was supply side economics supposed to do? It was supposed to make deep tax cuts, spend more on defense, and guess what, folks, that is going to cause the budget to be balanced. That was what supply side economics was supposed to do--advocated, by the proponents of this amendment. It was going to balance the budget. 
   The theory is the trickle down theory: Cut the taxes of the most wealthy, they invest a lot more, it trickles down and the economy starts humming and it balances the budget. That was the Laffer curve. Guess what, it did not work. We kind of knew it was not going to work, but it was such a temptation, such a siren song to vote these huge tax cuts, hoping, hoping, hoping that what the proponents said would come true. Guess what, it did not. It did not come true at all. 
   The tax cut was passed in 1981. Then what happened in 1982? This Congress, a Republican Congress, and President Reagan, had to change course. They had to raise taxes. The Republican Congress and Republican President raised taxes in 1982. Then guess what. This tax increase was not enough because the deficits were just so large. The Republican Congress and Republican President had to raise taxes again in 1984. They had to raise taxes more because the deficit was so large. The national debt in 1980 was roughly about  $1 trillion; 8 years later it was roughly $3 trillion, maybe close to $4 trillion. It tripled and quadrupled during that time of the huge tax cuts. Then we had to add more taxes back again in 1982 and 1984. 
   So, in many ways this is history repeating itself. Democrats in the Senate support a tax cut. We support using a third of the on-budget surplus to pay for a tax cut. But we are just saying don't use all of the on-budget surplus for tax cuts with virtually all going to the most wealthy Americans. 
   Do you know what else is going on here? I do believe the proponents of this bill are so--not distrustful, but so opposed to Government that they want these huge tax cuts partly to force down deeper cuts, way below the baseline in spending. I think they want to cut veterans' benefits 30 percent; they want to cut health education 20, 30 percent; want to cut these programs. I think there are really many on that side who want to make these cuts. They want to. As strange as that might sound, they want to. That is another reason for this huge tax cut because it will force cuts in spending later on. 
   We have already cut spending. Discretionary spending has been cut so much by this body over the last 10 years it is unbelievable. And the size of government has gone down, with many fewer federal employees than there were years ago. 
   To sum it all up, we have seen this provision in the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee soundly rejected this amendment. I urge the Senate to also soundly reject this amendment. It is not good policy. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   If you do that, of course, you get that chart. But that is not the CBO numbers under which the Senate Finance Committee operated. That is not the numbers under which the House operated. That is not the numbers under which the rest of us operated. So that is why I am saying we are not operating off the same numbers. You produced your own numbers by telling CBO to produce them the way you wanted them produced.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the point I am making is, those numbers are accurate, if you believe the assumptions behind the chart. The assumptions behind the chart are no increases, not even inflationary adjustment, for discretionary spending over the next 10 years. I think that is an unrealistic assumption. And it is, in effect, a reduction of some $500 billion over 10 years. If you add in the $127 billion for defense, that means, in effect, about a $775 billion reduction in domestic spending. So again, he is right, if you make those assumptions. I say those assumptions are unrealistic.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas for her amendment. It is a good amendment. It does deal with an inequity in the code clearly, simply. I congratulate her, too, because she is taking the course that we in the Democratic alternative took in trying to address this problem when we proposed to raise the standard deduction as well to address essentially the marriage tax penalty. 
   It is interesting; there is a marriage tax penalty today, but there is also a marriage tax bonus. Basically, the rule of thumb is 70-30. That is, if there is more than a 70-30 percent differential between the income of each spouse, then there is a marriage bonus; that is, you get a tax bonus for marriages as opposed to a penalty. 
   The penalty situation arises roughly when the 70-30 starts to narrow down, is less of a differential, and when both spouses are earning a similar income. That is what we are addressing here, the penalty side, because more couples have both spouses working. It is interesting to note, there is a bonus for getting married today if the differential is roughly between 70-30. 
   The amendment the Senator from Texas is offering goes part way to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Our Democratic alternative actually went a lot further. She raises the standard deduction by about $1,400, and the Democratic alternative raised the standard deduction for married couples by about $4,300. 
   In addition, in our proposal we began to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for itemizers; that is, for couples who itemize. The amendment before us deals only with couples who use the standard deduction. There are some couples who still itemize in the Tax Code, and it is our hope that we could address, eliminate, as you would, the marriage tax penalty not only for couples who use the standard deduction but also for couples who itemize. 
   Also, we in the Democratic alternative raised the standard deduction not only for married couples but also for singles. We thought the standard deduction should go up quite a bit higher than it now is for singles. 
   The long and short of it is, this amendment goes part way in raising the standard deduction. We proposed to go a lot further in raising the standard deduction, but the net effect is to help begin to eliminate the marriage tax penalty by raising the standard deduction for married couples. It is our hope that maybe a little bit later the Senator from Texas would, since she sees the wisdom in our proposal, go a little further and agree to other provisions that we in the Democratic alternative have suggested. 
   I do not think this really is a matter that requires a lot of debate. I believe most Senators agree this is a good amendment. It begins to eliminate the penalty married couples pay. It is our suggestion we also address the marriage tax penalty for couples who itemize because that would begin to complete the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. Again, I hope that occurs at some reasonable future date. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think there is another dimension to this tax bill which I think is important for us to address. It is not only tax reduction in the amount of the reduction and not only the composition of the reduction, it is also whether we are making this Tax Code even more complex. 
   If there is anything we hear from our people at home, it is that this Tax Code is much too complex; it is just a mess. I see the Presiding Officer, who has deep experience in this, is nodding his head in agreement. We all know that he is right. 
   Regrettably, when Congress passes tax legislation, we tend not to pay much attention to whether this adds further complexity to the code. We rarely pay any attention to that. 
   Frankly, I take some pride in that I pushed for the provision of the law last year that directs the IRS, in conjunction with the Joint Tax Committee, to come up with a complexity analysis of new provisions that the Congress enacts. We did not get this analysis until after the Finance Committee reported out its bill, but we did get it, finally. 
   I have with me a letter from Charles Rossotti, the Commissioner of the IRS, to Ms. Lindy Paull, who is the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a brief analysis of the additional complexity that the bill before us would cost. 
   Just by way of example, we are here today trying to correct a problem by providing relief for the marriage tax penalty. This marriage tax penalty is where a couple pays a higher net tax when both couples earn about the same amount of money. The underlying bill before us today attempts to address that problem, but in a way which is very complex. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is a much more crude way to deal with alleviating the marriage tax penalty by raising the standard deduction by a significant amount, an approach that we took in our Democratic alternative bill, too, where we would raise the standard deduction even more. But to give you an example of the additional complexity that this bill would cause in trying to resolve the marriage tax penalty, let me just state the following items which I hope we will get worked out as this bill progresses. 
   Essentially, taxpayers would have to fill out two forms or the 1040 would have to have more columns and many more items, because essentially couples would have to fill out their 1040 in many ways twice--one as if married, and then separate, as if joint filers, attempting to determine which is less in that tax, and so forth. 
   Then there is the question of allocation of personal exemptions: When you file separately, who gets the personal exemptions, the additional personal exemption for children, and so forth, and who doesn't. 
   Then there is the question of large medical payments, the medical deduction, which, as the Presiding Officer knows better than anybody else in the Chamber, is about 700 percent of adjusted gross income. And then the question is, How is that allocated--one spouse or do both spouses get it or whatnot? 
   There is a lot of additional complexity that couples would face under the underlying bill. All of this is not glamorous stuff. It doesn't get headlines. It is not in the evening news. It is my hope that as we undertake the work in this body, as well as in the other body, to reduce taxes, and we try to do it in a fair way, we also do it in a way that is less complex, not more complex. 
   As this bill stands tonight, with respect to the marriage tax penalty relief, it is going to be much more complex for taxpayers, for individual taxpayers, whether they file separately, particularly for married taxpayers trying to determine how to deal with the solution we have so far drafted with respect to the marriage tax penalty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I would like to emphasize a point that I made earlier about complexity. The tax bill passed by the other body reduces capital gains. Without getting into whether they should or should not be reduced, the effective date is July 1, 1999, which adds tremendous additional complexities to the code--to accountants, who have to add in more lines, and for programmers in their computers to adjust to the IRS. 
   The preliminary analysis is that there are many more pages for the capital gains increase schedule than currently is required. It is immense. Add to that Y2K. This provision goes into law on July 1. I am just addressing the complexity. I am not talking about the merits. 
   Then the IRS--who knows? It may well have to go back and retest their Y2K program to see if it works again with these additional items that are plugged in. 
   I very much hope the conferees on their tax bill, in working with the President when this bill is finally put together, pay much more attention to the complexity than they have in the past. Just bear down on that because if we hear anything from the taxpayers, it is the additional complexity of the code. We have an obligation not to add additional complexity. 
   In my experience in all of the debate on all of the tax bills, we have to cut a little bit here and raise some more revenue. We are going to add a little bit over here, with not one second of attention to whether or not this adds additional complexity to the taxpayers. 
   We have had IRS hearings on the problems the IRS has caused the taxpayers. There is some truth to that. The IRS has been a little bit too draconian in some ways in some of the proceedings that it has brought against taxpayers. They have been a bit rough. 
   But mark my words. Most of the complexity is caused by Congress. Most of it is caused by Congress. We are a little two-faced around here. We like to say: Oh boy, we are helping taxpayers reducing taxes--and at the same time we are increasing complexity. We don't talk about that. But we have an obligation to address both tax reduction as well as complexity. 
   I very much hope we live up to our responsibility and address that because it is a huge problem. No wonder Americans want a flat tax. It is the complexity. 
   On the other hand, I might ask myself and each of you, how do you address the marriage tax penalty with a national tax? Americans want both simplicity and equity. We all want both simplicity and equity. Of course, those are enemies of each other. The more something is simple, the more someone else claims it is inequitable and applies to them. The more we try to deal with them to make it more equitable, the less simple the code becomes. But nevertheless we have an obligation. I very much hope we address it and solve it. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this debate is almost surreal. We are debating whether to be reckless or not. It comes down to that, whether to be responsible or not. I am astounded that the Senate is having this debate of whether to be responsible or whether to be reckless. 
   The numbers are clear. They are compelling. The logic is steel-trap logic, with these numbers showing what this Republican majority budget tax proposal will cost--creating recklessness, irresponsibility. The numbers are just black and white clear. 
   This side has come up with charts, numbers; we have quoted from objective observers, columnists. It all comes out the same. This is extremely irresponsible. Let me remind my colleagues again why. 
   First of all, this is a column in a recent, very respected paper, the Wall Street Journal, from a day or two ago: ``GOP Uses Two Sets of Books. Double-Counting Surplus Keeps Alive the Notion of Being Within Budget.'' That is from the Wall Street Journal written by David Rogers. No one accuses him of being a biased Democrat. He is a reporter of one of the most respected financial papers in the world, the Wall Street Journal. 
   This is his conclusion of what is going on: GOP uses two sets of books; double-counting. 
   I call that reckless. I call that irresponsible. Again, it is surreal. 
   Let me point this out, again, undisputed. Nobody disputes this. The Republican tax breaks explode, like the atom bomb, in the second 10 years. Nobody disputes that. If you added interest to this, their tax cuts are roughly $1 trillion. There is nothing left over for anything else--Medicare, veterans. If you add in defense, which I am sure the Republican majority is going to do, that amounts to about a 40-percent cut, 40 percent in veterans' benefits, in education, et cetera. That is just the first 10 years. 
   Then you add it out in the next 10 years and it is over $2 trillion.

   Mr. BAUCUS. So $2 trillion, plus interest on the national debt, at a time when the baby boomers retire. Why is that so important? 
   Just one more chart here. It shows when the baby boomers are going to retire, when current younger Americans are going to retire. It is clear. The chart goes way up, beginning here in 2010, and the cost is $250 billion by 2020, at a time when the trust fund, the Medicare trust fund, comes to zero. 
   So add it all together and the Medicare trust fund comes down to zero in 2015. No dollars are left there. The baby boomer population is exploding and the tax cuts, which push us down into a deeper deficit, will be exploding in the second 10 years. No wonder the majority party wants us to pass this motion waiving all points of order, waiving fiscal responsibility. Again, why are we debating this? Why are we even debating whether to be responsible or irresponsible? It is clear. 
   One final point. We remember that dreadful day when a conference report was brought back to this body with everything including the kitchen sink in it--everything--bills that were never debated in either the House or Senate, tax bills that were never debated, spending bills that were never debated. They all came back in one gigantic package. That is going to happen if this motion passes. That is very irresponsible. It is irresponsible to us and to the American people. 
   I am just astounded, frankly, that we as a Democratic Party are in a position of saving the majority party from themselves and, more important, saving the American people. What happened in the 1980s? This is history all over again. In the 1980s, this body, the Republican President and Republican Congress, at the time succumbed to the siren song of huge tax breaks. What happened? Deficits exploded. Then what happened? The Republican Congress was forced to increase taxes. The Republican Congress and the President were forced to increase taxes twice--in 1982 and 1984. 
   So I say if we, today, lock in these huge tax cuts for the future, they are going to have to come back again to re-enact it and put it back in place at a future time. I don't think they want to do that. I urge colleagues to do what is right and not support the majority on this motion.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I begin by asking Members and the public to review the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD, given 15 or 20 minutes ago. It was one of the best summations of the facts and choices we now face that I have ever heard. 
   Senator CONRAD is a former tax commissioner of the State of North Dakota and is intimately familiar with tax matters. He also is a very senior member on the Budget Committee. He is very deeply involved in all of the tax and spending matters that face our Federal budget. I urge Senators to review the comments made by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD. They were very much on target. As I said, it was probably the best factual summary of the choices facing Members that I have heard in the entire debate. 
   Essentially, we have choices that are quite significant. How are we going to manage this additional surplus? I don't want to say awesome, but it is very unusual for this country to have a budget surplus and be faced with these choices. Not too coincidentally, it is the end of the 1990s that we have the choice, as we face the next century, the millennium. I think the American people sent legislators to the Senate and the Congress to do what is right, to do what is right when we have a big surplus. 
   It has been stated many times, and I will repeat it: The projections over the next 10 years are for a $3 trillion surplus, $2 trillion out of payroll tax additional revenues because more people are working, the economy is doing so well, the payroll tax revenues increase. We have agreed that that $2 trillion generated from the payroll tax increases will go into the Social Security trust fund. We want to make sure the Social Security trust fund is as secure as we can possibly make it. It seems reasonable those revenues go to the Social Security trust fund. That is agreed to here. That is not a problem. 
   The question is: With the remaining $1 trillion of the $3 trillion that comes out of general revenue--from income taxes, including corporate and individual income taxes--what do we do with that? Very simply, it comes down to making choices. Under the choices we make, some people are going to be helped and some people are going to be hurt. That is the nature of choices. Or some people are helped more and some people are helped not quite as much because we have to make choices. 
   So essentially what do we have in front of us? I would like to show a chart that has been presented many times, but it is important to drive this point home. It is a fact. The fact is, our friends on the other side of the aisle do propose a tax cut of about $792 billion over the next 10 years. Because of that tax cut, it means the debt will not be reduced as fast as otherwise might be, which means interest on the debt will be a little more. That additional interest on the debt is about $141 billion. If we add the two together, in effect the tax cut offered by the other side really takes $933 billion out of the roughly $1 trillion surplus. That is a fact. Nobody can deny that. That is a fact. 
   Then the next question is, does that make sense? Who is helped by that? Who is hurt by that? Given the composition of the tax reduction, those helped tend to be the most wealthy Americans at a period in our American history when our economy is doing very well. Who is hurt? The people hurt by this tend to be people who are necessarily going to face very severe reductions in veterans' benefits. It might be in education provisions, it might be the FBI salaries, Head Start, kids not admitted to the program, and so forth. 
   Why do I say that? I say that because the budget tax proposal before us, presented by the other side, necessarily assumes we are going to stick with the budget caps on discretionary spending. 
   My friends around the country watching this ask what in the world are discretionary spending caps? Let me explain to the American public what they are. Essentially, Congress passed a budget, by the other side, entirely by the other side--and by the other side I mean the Republican party--which set very tight budget caps. If those budget caps are projected in the next 10 years, that necessarily means about a $595 billion cut in discretionary spending, which is spending on such things as education, veterans' benefits, Head Start programs, education programs, and so forth. But to make it even worse, that does not take into consideration the probable scheduled increase in defense spending of about $127 billion, which means if you add the two together, this budget means about $775 billion in real discretionary spending cuts. That is necessarily, arithmetically, mathematically, the consequence of this proposal --cuts that deep. That means, if defense is increased $127 billion, all the other discretionary spending will be cut about 43 percent by the year 2009. 
   That means a 43-percent cut in veterans' benefits. Let me tell you a little more about that. What does that mean? That means about 1.5 million veterans will be turned away--turned away because of those cuts. It means about 375,000 kids will be out of the Head Start Program, gone--375,000 kids. That is necessary because of a 43-percent cut in all these programs because this budget assumes no increase in discretionary spending caps and probably, if we are realistic with ourselves, it means the other side is going to add back in defense. That nets out at a 43-percent cut. 
   I am not saying we should increase these programs above the baseline, although perhaps in some areas we could. But at the very least, we should not cut them 43 percent across the board. Let's say we are not going to cut them 43 percent across the board. Let's say we are going to keep Head Start funding. That necessarily means you have to cut something else by more than 43 percent. That is where we are. Nobody can dispute those facts --nobody. Those are the facts. 
   Let me show another chart. To state it differently, take a dollar bill. This is the line--it is hard to see on this chart --of the tax breaks as a consequence of the bill before us. This is the additional interest payment, which is about $63 billion for everything else, and I have already outlined what the consequences of that are. 
   The proposal before us is the Democratic alternative. What is it? Basically, we think it is a wiser set of choices. Again, with roughly a $1 trillion surplus that we are debating, the question is what choices are we going to make? What should we do about it? The choice made by the other side is essentially all of it in tax cuts--all of  it. Because if you add interest lost, it basically comes to it all going to tax cuts. That is basically what it is. 
   We say no. First, because that is a projection and we do not know if it will be real; it is so back loaded. You have heard all the arguments. Rather, let's do a little bit here and a little bit there that protects the future. We say let's have about a $300 billion tax cut. Sure, we are for tax cuts. Let's take $300 billion and reduce it. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.

   Mr. BAUCUS. So another third, we say, goes to Medicare. Let's give some to Medicare. I heard a Senator a few minutes ago say it is reckless or it is irresponsible to spend money on programs. I ask the Senator, is it reckless, is it radical to save a little bit for Medicare? The Medicare trust fund is in dire straits, even more so than the Social Security trust fund. Right now it is projected that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund is due to reach zero about 2015. What happens if the economy is not doing as well in the next several years? What does that mean? That means the Medicare trust fund is due to reach zero earlier than 2015. 
   You wonder why the projections for the Medicare trust fund expiration kind of bounce around? It is basically because the economy itself changes. Some years we are doing very well, some years not so well. Right now we are doing well, so that means a 2015 expiration date. 
   So we are saying in the proposal crafted by our leader, the Senator from New York, let's save about a third of this surplus, this $1 trillion surplus, for Medicare. One-third for tax cuts, one-third for Medicare, and we are also saying come on, men and women around here, let's be realistic. 
   I mentioned earlier about the discretionary spending caps and how the budget on the other side assumes we are not going to raise the caps, which means in effect if we add some for defense, about a $775 billion cut in spending. We are saying that is unrealistic. We are not going to cut veterans' benefits nearly that amount. We are not going to take young kids out of the Head Start Program. So we are saying take a third of that $1 trillion, roughly, and let's dedicate that to the discretionary spending programs so the reductions are not as great as we note they otherwise might be. The result is the interest cost that will necessarily result from this proposal. 
   So, again, it comes down to choices. Who is helped? Who is hurt? We say the people who should be helped are seniors on Medicare. We should help shore up the Medicare trust fund, the program. Some of these Medicare dollars could be set aside for drug benefits. We know how many seniors desperately need help with prescription drug benefits. We are saying some could help veterans. 
   What are we really saying? Many say, give back the tax cut, give it back to the people, give it back now to the people. 
   It is a very sympathetic argument. We are saying let's be responsible but let's give it back to our children. Let's give it back to our children in greater deficit reduction. Let's give it back to our children to help their parents with Medicare. Let's give it back to the future. Let's be responsible. 
   I do think we have a moral obligation as representatives of the people to do what we can to leave this country in at least as good a shape, if not better shape, than we found it. That means reducing the debt, it means helping shore up Medicare, it means just meeting people's needs in a very solid, responsible way. 
   The majority plan hurts people on Medicare, hurts veterans, hurts kids in Head Start, hurts the country. We say let's not hurt the country, let's help the country. Let's help the country with a balanced, responsible alternative, one I think the American people really would prefer if they were fully involved in this debate rather than a reckless, irresponsible--I hate to categorize it that way, but I do think it is, quite honestly--a program that takes all of the surplus, $1 trillion, and sends it all back for tax cuts at a time when Mr. Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, says is not the right time for a tax cut. He says it is not the right time because the economy is already heated up and we are dangerously close to the point where, with more stimulus, a bubble could burst and we could be causing a lot more problems than we can even think of at this point. 
   I thank the Chair and yield back my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a motion to recommit the bill and send it back to the Finance Committee with instructions. The instructions would be to change the tax bill to ensure that 100 percent of the off-budget surplus--that is, the Social Security surplus--be set in a lockbox that is in reserve, and it also provides that one-third of the on-budget, or non-Social Security surplus, be set aside for Medicare. 
   You might remember that although both sides generally agree that of the roughly $3 trillion projected surplus over 10 years, $2 trillion would be reserved for Social Security--that is the Social Security lockbox part of this amendment--we have not reached agreement on the $1 trillion projected on-budget surplus, and this amendment reserves one-third of that for Medicare. 
   Why is this amendment so important? Plainly, simply, we believe that a portion of the budget surplus should be reserved for Medicare. Americans very much believe in Medicare. Americans want Medicare. Americans want the Medicare program to be in good shape. They want to have the security of knowing that seniors will have a better chance to have a portion of their health care bills provided for, and that means we need Medicare. 
   There are several problems facing us with Medicare right now. One of them is solvency. 
   I would like everybody to look at this chart behind me. Very simply, it shows that the Medicare trust fund will become insolvent, under current projections, by the year 2015. That assumes the economy stays as strong in the next 15 years as it is today. That is the assumption. 
   If for some reason economic growth in America declines slightly, inflation rises slightly, if for some reason there is a reduction in the stock market boom, a reduction in markets, if for some reason interest rates go up, then the insolvency of the trust fund moves back to the left; that is, before 2015. 
   The Medicare trust fund is in much worse shape than Social Security. Projections are with this lockbox amendment that the Social Security trust fund will be in good shape way off in the future. That is not true for the Medicare trust fund, not true at all. 
   In fact, this chart shows that, optimally, the trust fund is going to reach a deficit situation--the surplus will be zero--and Medicare payments will therefore have to be decreased under the hospital trust fund, at the very latest by the year 2015, probably earlier. 
   Why is that doubly important? We are reserving a portion for Medicare, one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare, not only because the solvency of the trust fund is in a difficult position, but also because the baby boomers are due to reach retirement age at about 2011 and on through to about 2020. 
   The baby boomers are going to reach retirement, and that is going to cause much more pressure on the trust fund. We believe it is prudent today to reserve a portion of the on-budget surplus --a third of it--to meet that problem, to meet that demographic condition that is going to occur; namely, more baby boomers. We think it is only prudent to preserve Medicare for that reason. 
   There is another reason to save for Medicare, and that is very simply to help make it easier for us in the Congress to provide prescription drug coverage for seniors. If we have heard anything lately with respect to Medicare, it is that seniors want and deserve some kind of Medicare prescription drug coverage. Why is that? One reason is that today, essentially, Medicare does not provide for drug coverage out of hospital. 
   There are some exceptions for that, but as a basic rule Medicare does not provide for prescription drug coverage for seniors except when they are in the hospital. That is a problem. Roughly 30 percent of Americans over age 65 depend entirely on Social Security for their income. 
   There are a lot of seniors who are not very wealthy. A lot of seniors who desperately look for that Social Security paycheck and who desperately are trying to figure out how to balance their individual or family budget to pay for prescription drugs, to pay for heating bills, to pay for food. This is not some cataclysmic scare tactic. It is not some wild story. 
   All of us in this Chamber who go to drugstores to get prescription drugs run across an elderly lady or an elderly man talking to the druggist, trying to balance things out, trying to fill a prescription and trying to find enough money to pay for it all, and asking the druggist, ``Well, maybe just half,'' because they don't have enough money. I have seen it. I will bet that most Members of this body have seen either that or something similar to it. 
   When I first ran for office, I knocked on virtually every door in Missoula County, MT, a lot of doors. One thing that struck me--and I know it gets everybody who does the same thing--there are a lot of people who are really poor, who are really hurting, and most of them are seniors. There are seniors who are having a hard time making ends meet. They are lonely. And we know, too, that drug benefits, drug coverage is more and more important to seniors. Seniors rely much more on drugs today than they did 20, 30 years ago. In part, that is because pharmaceuticals have come out with lots of different drugs that affect people's medical condition, help people's health, especially for seniors, whose health needs more attention in later years. That is clear. We all know that. 
   When I talk with folks when I am home--it is with some frequency--I see it everywhere. You are reminded just how many people in our country are really in tough shape and they need help. Most of them are seniors. A lot of seniors need a lot of help. Our proposal is simple--a third of the on-budget surplus should be saved for Medicare. 
   Now the alternative from the other side has no coverage for Medicare--zero, nothing, not a red cent for Medicare, nothing.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield at the appropriate point. 
   We have two amendments before us. One is the Republican alternative, which is the lockbox only for Social Security, that is all and, I might say, in a way which is very dangerous. It will cause train wrecks. It is going to  cause the precipitation of confrontations in government. It is very reckless--very reckless. That is one alternative--only Social Security in a reckless way. 
   The other alternative before us, of the two amendments, is a lockbox that protects Medicare also, but in a nonreckless way. 
   Those are the two choices. It is very simple. We say that in these times of tremendous projected surpluses, at least a third of the on-budget surplus should be protected for Medicare--at least a third. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle says zero--they want to put aside nothing for Medicare. We say a third, and we lock it in. We lock it in to the same degree as both sides want to in some way lock in Social Security protection. We lock it in, and we provide for it. The other side has not one red cent for Medicare, not one red cent, not a penny, not a dime, not a quarter, nothing. If they come back and say, we have some money for Medicare, that is a wish. They don't lock it in. They just say maybe. Because of the big tax cut, it is not going to be there. It is just a hope and a wish and a prayer. We say we lock it in. 
   That is the difference. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to take advantage of this situation by locking in a third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. 
   Another reason for doing this is, all of us have heard in the last year, roughly, about how we went too far in 1997 with the Balanced Budget Act provisions which cut providers' benefits. We have all heard that, that we have cut hospitals, too, that we cut home health care too much, and so forth. 
   Let me show my colleagues this chart. If they can see this chart, basically it shows the projected cuts under Medicare were about $100 billion over 5 years. Now it has turned out that the actual cuts are almost twice that, almost $200 billion over 5 years. We have all heard that. 
   To be a little more specific, look how big the differential is between anticipated cuts under the BBA 1997 and the actual cuts. In the anticipated cuts, the differential is greatest for home health care--big difference. It turns out that the actual cuts for home health care are more than twice what we anticipated. And the actual cut under skilled nursing homes is about 60 percent more than we anticipated. 
   So I will summarize and say that the choice between us is very simple. We have two amendments we are considering. One is a lockbox with only Social Security, in a very dangerous way because it is tied to projections by the CBO. CBO determines what the debt limit is under their amendment. 
   The other choice is ours, which is not only to protect Social Security but also to protect to the same degree Medicare, at a time when the American Government faces a surplus, a surplus of about $1 trillion over 10 years. It is very simple: Save a third of the surplus for Medicare, for seniors. Help them pay those health care bills. Help them get those prescription drug benefits. Help us relieve the undue pressure we have caused on home health care agencies, on nursing homes, on hospitals, particularly rural hospitals. 
   This is a no-brainer, Mr. President. This is pretty simple stuff. It is a matter of choices. Do we want to help people on Medicare or do we not? We say yes, we do want to help people on Medicare. We want to help those seniors. This amendment we are offering enables people who are senior citizens to get the health care protection and the health care benefits that we think are so important. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of words. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-baucus-mt-17-19990728</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. My question is, Where's the beef? There is nothing on the other side about what they want to do to help Medicare--nothing. The Senator from Pennsylvania started out by saying: Gee, there's money for Medicare. Then he shifted his argument to say we should not use general revenue. Then he shifted his argument to say that the amendment we are offering is a charade, a smokescreen. But if you listen to the words, there is not one  word of what he wants to do to help Medicare and help Medicare beneficiaries, to provide money for drug benefits, to help address the balanced budget agreement overcut, and to help the solvency of the trust fund. 
   I ask again: Where's the beef? Not one word on that side about what they want to do to help Medicare. As a matter of fact, what I hear in the words is, first, we need some kind of structural reform. Let's get structural reform, but let's not use general revenue. 
   There has been reference to the Breaux commission. Senator BREAUX admits we need resources in addition to structural reform to help solve the Medicare problem. He said that. He is the chairman of the commission. He said we need it. I think he is right. The problems facing Medicare will require both structural reform as well as some additional resources to help solve the problem. At least that is his view, and he is chairman of the Breaux commission. He ought to have some idea of what is necessary. 
   I also remind my colleagues that structure reform is not easy. I will never forget catastrophic attempts several years ago. That was about $4 on seniors to pay for catastrophic and people went berserk. That thing was repealed faster than a New York minute because of the politics and the difficulty of addressing Medicare reform. 
   The Breaux commission did not come up with any super-majority recommendation. They could not. It is so difficult, which is not to say we should shirk from structure reform. Of course, we should work on structural reform, but we also need general funds to help with Medicare. 
   I was very perplexed when I saw the chart put up by the chairman of the Budget Committee. I want to ask him where he got his numbers. I know where he got his numbers. They are his own numbers, not CBO numbers. For example, the CBO baseline projection over the next 10 years is a surplus of about--it is on the chart--of about $2.896 billion. That is CBO. 
   If you look closely at the chairman's chart, down below in the corner it says: Source. What is the source? It is CBO and the Senate Budget Committee, not just CBO. 
   We have the Senate Budget Committee--I am trying to avoid the phrase ``cooked the books.'' I will tell you what it did to come up with the chart the chairman was showing. Here is what it did: 
   The Congressional Budget Office said, OK, we are going to freeze the caps as required under the budget through the year 2002. Then CBO said: We are going to assume a baseline at the rate of inflation for the remainder of the term up to about 2009. That is how they got this number, $2.896 billion. 
   What did the chairman of the Budget Committee do? He said: I know what I am going to do because the Democrats are really right. What I am going to do is come up with a different number to show there are more savings. 
   How did he do it? He said: OK, I am going to freeze the baseline after the year 2002 for discretionary spending, and that is going to mean that I get to come up with additional--that is the yellow, domestic priorities. 
   The fact is, that is very unrealistic and it's not what CBO projects. I think we ought to use the same numbers. A lot of us on our side think CBO is a little tainted; it has become a little political over the years. But I suggest we all start with the same numbers, and the best place to start is CBO. If the Senate Budget Committee majority can come up with its numbers, I suppose the Budget Committee minority can come up with its own numbers. It is no different. That is where we are. 
   It is important for Senators to know those are not CBO numbers, those are Senate Budget Committee numbers. Those are the majority's numbers, not CBO's numbers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Just say the yellow is an illusion, it is not there, because most of us, if we are realistic, are going to assume we are going to at least keep up with inflation over those years. If we do not keep up with inflation over those years, then we are going to dramatically cut programs. 
   How much are we going to cut? The figure is about a 54-percent cut in domestic spending. 
   By saying there is no inflation rate considered past the year 2002, for the rest of the term, these numbers represent, in effect, a 54-percent cut in discretionary spending. That is what it comes out to. That is pretty big. So that is why I say that yellow is an illusion. It is not going to happen. 
   If I could address another point. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle made two basic charges. First, they say that this is a smokescreen. That we really do not want a lockbox. My good friend, the Senator from New Mexico, said: Well, we have the points of order. It is true, we create an additional point of order, but it is a supermajority point of order--60 votes. It is pretty hard to get more than 60 votes around here. 
   Witness the waiver on the Byrd rule did not get 60 votes. Oh, that side really wanted to waive the Byrd rule. They could not do it. They could not get 60 votes. Sixty votes is a pretty big hurdle. 
   Make no mistake, we are very serious about protecting medicare. You can also tell that we are serious because we are proposing a lockbox that is very similar to the House lockbox which passed by an overwhelming margin. 
   Why is the Senate lockbox not a good idea? I will tell you why. Because it says the debt limit has to go down on a step basis, depending upon what CBO's projections really are for the debt. That is what it says. That is going to force all kinds of votes here to raise the debt limit if it does not work out that way. 
   We know all the charades around here, all the politics, all the nonsense that goes on around here, because of votes on raising the debt limit, whether or not to pay bills we know we have to pay anyway. It just doesn't make sense. It just does not make sense to tie the debt limit to what CBO says the projections are going to be on the debt. We already have a lockbox which works--at least the House thinks it works. The House approved it. I think only a handful of House Members voted against it. 
   So we are saying the House lockbox basically works. House Republicans voted for it; House Democrats voted for it. But we want to go one step further. We are also saying, let's reserve some money, a third of the surplus each year, reserve that for Medicare. If it is not used, if structural reform takes care of it and we do not have to use it, it can be used for tax cuts, it can be used for defense spending, it can be used for whatever this body thinks makes the most sense. But only with a supermajority vote. 
   My good colleagues on the other side of the aisle also made an argument about shifting $328 billion. That is a red herring. That argument has nothing to do with this issue. It is irrelevant. 
   The only point I am making is that of the $1 trillion on-budget surplus, we ought to at least set aside a third in a reserve fund for medicare. 
   Congress can decide what it wants to do in helping protect Social Security and Medicare. We can decide to provide for prescription drug benefits. We can address the problems caused by the balanced budget amendment cut backs. We can extend the solvency of the trust fund. That is what this amendment is all about. It is about reserving the funds necessary to help America's seniors. It is actually very simple. 
   Again, I go back to my basic question, Where is the beef? How do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle assure that are going to provide for Medicare, provide for seniors, provide for drug benefits for our elderly men and women? That is the problem. 
   I urge Senators, cut through all the rhetoric. Listen carefully to the underlying words. Sometimes, what people don't say is just as telling as what they do say. In this case, our good colleagues make no pretense of guaranteeing funds for medicare. Whereas we say, very simply, let's save a third of the surplus each year in a reserve fund. If we need it, fine. If we do not need it, fine--we can reduce the debt and leave our options open. 
   We have this opportunity because we have the large projected on-budget surplus in the future. We do not have these opportunities very often. How many Senators can remember times in the past having a $1 trillion on-budget projected surplus? I can't. I do not think anyone else can either. 
   What is the likelihood that is going to continue? What is the likelihood we are going to have this opportunity 5 years from now? What is the likelihood  we will have it 8, 10 years from now? Pretty slim; not very likely, in my judgment. 
   So we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to put aside the funds necessary to extend the solvency of Medicare. We have the opportunity to put aside the funds necessary for structural reforms. We have the opportunity to put aside the funds for a prescription drug benefit. I am saying, let's preserve this surplus--let's keep our options open. 
   Do you know what else our lockbox does? Deficit reduction. People want deficit and debt reduction. They are tired of being saddled with this debt. They don't want their children similarly constrained. That's why this lockbox is such a good proposal. If we don't need the funds for the next, say, 10 years--because the Medicare trust fund will be solvent at least until 2015--that is a $300 billion reduction in the national debt. That is what it comes down to. 
   So, again, I do not hear anything from the other side aisle about any guarantees to help Medicare except for words--maybe something in the future about structural reform, but certainly not in the budget tax debate--I repeat again, not one red cent for Medicare. 
   Helping to provide for Medicare is not a smokescreen because we do have a Social Security lockbox that works. Our lockbox is very similar to the one that the House passed. They passed it. If they passed it by such a large margin, providing a supermajority point of order, it makes sense to me that we should do it. But let's go farther and protect Medicare. Let's have both. Let's protect Social Security. Let's also protect Medicare. It is very simple. They are two parts of the same package, if you will, to help the elderly. 
   We have a lot of very poor elderly. About a third of the American elderly rely solely on Social Security for income--about a third. There are a lot of people who just do not have any money. Virtually one-third are dependent upon it. There are about 44 million people on Social Security including folks with disabilities. The average payment is about $750 a month. That is all. If a third are relying on only $750 a month, that means, clearly, they really need the help. 
   So, again: A lockbox for Social Security that works and a lockbox for Medicare that also works. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, a couple of points. I heard my good friend, the Senator from Missouri say, as has often been stated, they are using only 23 percent of the surplus for tax reduction. 
   I think it is important to get the facts out so the American public can decide what the truth is. The fact is, about $3 trillion is projected over the next 10 years. Mr. President, $2 trillion off-budget, Social Security surplus; $1 trillion on-budget surplus. No one disputes that. 
   We also agree that the roughly $2 trillion generated by the payroll tax, the off-budget surplus, should be reserved for Social Security. We all agree to that. What is in dispute is the $1 trillion remaining on-budget surplus. 
   The Republican tax cut essentially uses it all, roughly $800 billion, plus the interest expense added on because the tax cut will increase interest, which amounts to a 97-percent tax cut of the on-budget surplus. 
   So that we have our facts straight, it is roughly 25 percent of the total, if we include the $2 trillion for Social Security that we all agree to protect. What is in dispute is how much of the $1 trillion on budget is used for a tax cut. The answer to that is about 97 percent, including the interest. If interest is not included, maybe about 60 or 70 percent of the surplus is used for a tax cut. 
   Decide which numbers to use. Those are the facts. I will not stand here and say it is necessarily 97 percent or it is necessarily 23 percent. I think people should recognize what the truth is. 
   I have a couple of points. This is about choices. Either we choose to set aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare for seniors, or we don't. That is the choice. That is the choice we have between the two lockbox amendments. One says lockbox Social Security only; the other says lockbox Social Security and Medicare. We believe the proper choice is to protect Medicare. 
   There is a deeper choice I want to talk about for a moment. It is a choice that many senior citizens in our country make each day. Do they choose to use their income to pay for drugs or do they choose their income for food, to pay the rent, or to pay for the bus? That is the choice that many senior citizens make each day. 
   About 16 million Americans are faced with that choice a day. That is, 16 million Americans rely solely on Social Security for their income. About 30 percent of American senior citizens rely solely on Social Security for their income, which comes out to about $750 a month. Seniors with a total income of about $750 a month have to make choices. Choose for drugs, choose to pay the rent, choose to pay the food bill, the bus, taxi service--those are the choices. They have to decide which among the choices to make. 
   We are saying let's help the seniors with that choice. Let's help seniors pay the drug bill. Let's help seniors pay a little more of the doctor bill. If there is anything that obsesses senior citizens, it is their health. 
   I will never forget when I was walking across Montana campaigning for Congress 24 years ago, I was walking toward Butte, MT, near Elk Park. I was walking down the highway, and I could see perpendicular to me an older fellow hunched up way off in the distance walking toward his mailbox. I could tell we were going to meet at the mailbox. I had my brochure in my pocket in my campaign for Congress. Sure enough, we met at the mailbox. I pulled out my brochure and said: Sir, I am Max BAUCUS. I am running for Congress. Is there anything on your mind you want to talk about? Anything that is really bothering you that you want to talk about? 
   He said: Oh, nothing except the perplexities of health. 
   It is certainly true for seniors, and he very much was a senior citizen. 
   In summation, this is about choices. I think the choice is for Medicare, not against Medicare. The choice is also to help those senior citizens pay for their medical benefits. I hope Senators choose for seniors. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when the tax reconciliation budget comes before the Senate tomorrow, I plan to offer an amendment which will provide for a lockbox on the Social Security surplus; that is, all the payroll tax surplus that would otherwise go to the Social Security trust fund would be locked into that trust fund. The amendment also provides that one-third of the onbudget surplus be set aside for Medicare. 
   Why am I doing that? Very simply, Mr. President, because I believe that as we leave this century and this millennium and as we move into the next century and the next millennium, we are faced with a historic opportunity to make decisions that are going to either correctly or incorrectly affect lots of Americans. 
   What do I mean? Very simply this. A little history first: 
   About 18 or 19 years ago, after the 1980 elections, this Congress passed a very large tax reduction bill--very large--proposed by the President and passed by this Congress. 
   What happened as a consequence of that very large tax cut in 1981? I think all commentators will agree--at least a vast majority of commentators will agree--that it caused the deficits in this country to shoot up and the national debt to rise. That tax cut was accompanied by a big increase in defense spending. I am not going to quarrel how much that increase was correct or incorrect. But the agreement is--and by far most people agree--that as a consequence of that action deficits rose dramatically. 
   If we add up the annual deficits beginning with President George Washington and continuing every year through all the Presidents in American history, up through and including Jimmy Carter, they total about $1 trillion. 
   In 1988, when Congress passed a tax cut, what happened? The national debt shot up. Why? Because deficits shot up. The national debt in 1980 was about $1 trillion. Twelve years later, the national debt was about $5-, $6- or $7 trillion. It increased $4- or $5 trillion, from $1 trillion to $6- or $7 trillion in that 12-year period--a huge national debt--and we are paying interest on that national debt in the neighborhood of $267- to $280 billion a year. That is what happened. 
   What did Congress do? It passed two tax increases. The Republican President, Republican Congress, passed two tax increases. There was a significant tax increase in 1982 because the deficits were going out of sight and, in 1984, another tax increase with the Republican President, Republican Congress because the deficits were still going out of sight. That is what happened in the 1980s when Congress was tempted and succumbed to the get-rich-quick siren song with huge tax reductions. That is what happened: instant gratification. However, the future kids and grandkids paid for it in the national debt increase. We passed on the burden and gave it to ourselves, saddling the future with the burden. That is what we did in 1981, pure and simple. 
   In 1999, what happened? Through a lot of factors, including the Democratic President and the Democratic Congress in 1993, we enacted a large deficit reduction, half tax increases and half spending cuts. Economists agree, as a consequence of that, the national deficit started coming down. The debt starting coming down. 
   That is not the only reason the debt started coming down. The economy was doing pretty well. Interest rates were down, probably because the market saw the President was going to get a handle on spending and handle on the deficit because the deficits were so high. With increasing technology and globalization, American firms became much more competitive in competing in world markets. The American economy did very well in the last several years as a consequence of all those factors. Incomes have gone up, payroll tax revenues have gone up, and income tax receipts have gone up. 
   What does that mean today? In 1999, we are projecting a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. Mr. President, $2 trillion of that is payroll tax revenue increases, which we all agree will go to the Social Security trust fund; $2 billion of the $3 billion comes from payroll taxes, and we all agree it will go to the Social Security trust fund. That leaves $1 trillion in the surplus. That $1 trillion is generated by income tax receipts. 
   The question before the Congress is: What are we going to do with that $1 trillion? That is the question. As we are poised to move into the next millennium, I say we ought to make careful decisions about that. We better not  blow it. We better be careful, be prudent with the taxpayers' money, and do what is right. 
   What is right? I have two charts. The first chart shows the proposal that will come to the floor tomorrow, passed by the majority party, that will provide for a huge tax cut of $792 billion over 10 years. You have to add back $179 billion in interest over 10 years on the national debt because of the tax 
   cut. That means the debt will go up, with more interest payments to make. What does that leave? That leaves $7 billion less after 10 years. That is all. 
   Man, oh, man, I could stand here for days and days and talk about the problems with that proposal. Let me mention a few. No. 1, this is only a projection. We have no idea what the surplus will be over the next 10 years. It is just a guess. Most commentators think the economy is overheated now. Maybe there is a bubble economy, and maybe the economy will not do so well over a good part of the next 10 years compared to the last 5 or 6 years. 
   This is a projection. What do we do with the projection? We are locking in tax cuts for the future, offset by a hope that we will have the revenues to pay for it. That is what we are doing. That is one thing that is wrong with this: A tax cut in place by law, offset by a hope that the money will be there--and it probably won't be there. 
   Second, I point out that the tax cuts are, in fancy parlance, backloaded. Most go into effect near the end of the 10-year period, meaning in the next 10 years, boy, we will really pay. That is when the deficit will start to increase. I said ``deficit'' increase, not ``surplus.'' 
   The next chart shows that the baby boomers will start to retire about the year 2010, and in 2020 and 2030 most baby boomers will be hitting retirement age. That is when the tax cuts go into effect an even greater amount, meaning we have less money to take care of the baby boomers. 
   I say the size of this tax cut is much too much. Alan Greenspan does not agree with it. He says now is not the time for a tax cut because he knows it will tend to put upward pressure on interest rates. We all don't want to see an increase in interest rates. 
   In addition, there is nothing left over for Medicare. Medicare is an extremely important program for Americans. Ask Americans which national programs they think make the most sense, and most, I daresay, think Social Security is one and Medicare probably is another. Before Medicare went into effect, 50 percent of seniors had no health care; 50 percent had no health care benefits or programs when Medicare went into effect. Now virtually every senior has some kind of health care program. 
   What are the current problems with Medicare? There are several. Let me name three. No. 1, it does not provide for prescription drugs. Senior citizens get drugs when they are in the hospital, but Medicare will not pay for prescription drugs when they are out of the hospital. There is zero payment under Medicare for prescription drugs. 
   We all know that health care is changing in America. It is changing a little bit more from procedures and a little more toward drugs, DNA benefits, and things of that nature. Drugs have become much more important. That is one problem with Medicare. We have to provide for prescription drugs. Medicare does not now provide for outpatient prescription drugs. 
   No. 2, this Congress cut back on Medicare payments too much in 1997 with the so-called Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Medicare payments to hospitals increased significantly, I think on average about 10 percent over the 1990s. Now it is negative, it is cut back, because of provisions this Congress enacted a couple of years ago, which were too great, too much. We all hear it from our hospitals back home, whether they are teaching or rural hospitals, that it has been too much. That has to be dealt with. The majority budget does not deal with it, which is another reason for my amendment. 
   No. 3, Medicare is in trouble, folks. We all talk about Social Security. The Social Security trust fund will not reach zero deficit for 20 or 30 years. The Medicare trust fund will come down to zero, depending upon who is making the estimates, perhaps 12 or 15 years from now, much sooner than the Social Security trust fund. 
   I say, therefore, we should pay attention to Medicare. The amendment I will offer will provide that one-third of the on-budget surplus, one-third of the $1 trillion, will be dedicated to Medicare. 
   I know the arguments. We have to have structural reform of Medicare first before we can put more money into Medicare. I think most agree we need both structural reform and additional money for Medicare. When we in the Congress begin to address structural reform in Medicare, my guess is we will probably not have money anyway so it is good to set aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. 
   If we do not need that one-third at the time, we can send it back to the people in tax cuts or we can use it for veterans' care or for education or for whatnot. 
   In summation--and I thank the Chair for his patience--at the appropriate time, I will be offering an amendment along with Senator CONRAD to provide that one-third of the on-budget surplus be dedicated to Medicare along with the off-budget surplus dedicated to Social Security. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate the concerns of the Senator from New Hampshire. I think we all do. This is not an easy issue. But I think it is important to ask ourselves what is the best way, what is the most likely way, we Americans will properly help achieve the objectives we are looking for in Vietnam, and I daresay also with  China, because the China discharge resolution will be up before us at a later time today. 
   I oppose both of the motions to discharge. I daresay most of my colleagues will also oppose both of those motions. It is my judgment, and I think the judgment of most of us, that there are some differences between the United States and Vietnam and there are some differences between the United States and China. We know there are. But how do we best accomplish our objectives with these two countries? 
   I believe it is best to continue with the Jackson/Vanik waiver with Vietnam and what is called a ``normal trading relationship'' with China, which, essentially, is really less than average because the United States has trade agreements with many other countries which, in effect, provide for much better than average trading relations. 
   So we are really talking about the bare minimum standard for trading relationships. If we continue that standard for trade, that is, MFN or NTR, we will be more likely--working through other channels, and government to government or group to group--to accomplish the goals for which we are looking. 
   The world is changing. It is changing dramatically. Trade and commerce are so key, so vital. The more trade is encouraged among countries--particularly Vietnam and China--clearly, the more help we provide those countries in the form of government and judicial systems and enforcement systems that can be relied upon with predictability worldwide, not only for America but for other countries. 
   That is really the objective. There are certainly problems with Vietnam and with China. But we should deal with those issues on the levels in which they occur, whether it is China with human rights or nuclear proliferation or missile technology transfer or Taiwan or the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. We should deal with those issues one at a time; that is, not deny minimal trade relationships with a country just because we have other considerations and other problems. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire says he does not have the time to present his case. The Senator from New Hampshire has lots of time to present his evidence in many different ways before the Senate. If he has a strong case, a compelling case, that would encourage the Senate to take another position, I encourage the Senator to give it. There is morning business. There are lots of opportunities for the Senator to provide the information he says he has. 
   I am not really sure he has much more than he already provided. I note that other Senators, on both sides of the aisle, Senators who have served in Vietnam--including Senator MCCAIN from Arizona and Senator KERRY from Massachusetts--as the Senate has heard, very strongly oppose this discharge motion. They believe that non-trade issues are more likely to be dealt with successfully along the path that has been taken already in the past. 
   Countries have interests. Vietnam has an interest in world affairs; China does; the United States does. We have to deal with this in a solid way. The phrase that is often used is ``engagement.'' I think engagement makes sense, but more importantly it should be ``engagement without illusions''; that is, we talk with 
   countries, we negotiate with countries, we have to keep communicating with countries and looking for ways to find solutions. Engaging without illusions--without illusions that everything in that country is going along perfectly well. We have to be very realistic about things. 
   It is also important to remember at this time in the history of the world that with the United States so big and so powerful, it is beginning to cause some resentment worldwide. That is a new challenge facing America, how to deal with it, how to deal with that angst, how to deal with that concern that maybe we are too big, we are too inclusive, the English language pervades too much, the Internet uses the English language; American culture, McDonald's, and movies are too pervasive in countries; American military might is just too overwhelming, even by European standards; the concern that we might, since we did not lose a single life in Kosovo and won, that militarily we might deal with other areas in the same way. 
   There are lots of different concerns people have now, watching what America has done in the last several years. So we have to be careful. We have to be prudent. To deny something that is normal and expected, that is, a normal trade relation with China, would be unsettling and would cause many more problems than it is going to solve. 
   I fully understand the points of the Senator from New Hampshire, but often there are different ways to skin a cat. The cat we are trying to skin is the effective way, not the ineffective way. It is my judgment that the effective way is to continue the dialogue, continue the engagement, and continue the engagement without illusions but continue it nevertheless. I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to discharge the petition. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the feelings and good intentions of the Senator from New Hampshire, but I respectfully oppose this motion to discharge the Finance Committee from considering the resolution to disprove extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver for China. Why do I do so? First, I say to my good friend from New Hampshire, he has lots of opportunities to debate human rights, or any similar issues, on the floor. He can offer an amendment to any bill. That is a standing rule of the Senate. Any Senator can offer an amendment to virtually any bill at any time. He has that right. The rules of the Senate provide for unlimited debate. So he can talk for as long as he can physically stand on his own two feet. He has plenty of opportunity, as do all Senators, to raise issues that concern them. 
   I think it is inappropriate to discharge the Finance Committee from considering the resolution to disapprove an extension. Why? Very simply, because the current process has worked pretty well. 
   I am somewhat bemused when I think back on how furious the debate was on this issue--oh, gosh, it must be 4, 5, 6 years ago. In fact, I was one of the few Members of the Senate on the Democratic side who voted to sustain the veto of President Bush on this very measure, as a consequence of President Bush's intention to extend unconditional MFN--now NTR--status for China, which prevailed. Ever since then, gradually, over the years, each President, each year, has reached the same conclusion after studying all the issues--that there should be a 1-year unconditional extension of most-favored-nation trading status. We have changed the name now to normal trade relations status. That is more accurate--more normal than most favored. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it is least favored. That is because the United States has trade agreements with many other countries which give them favorable terms of trade compared with the standard of MFN, or NTR. 
   Over the years, as more and more Americans have become more familiar with this question, and as the Congress has become more familiar, it has now come to the point where the vast majority of Members of Congress agree that annual unconditional extensions make sense, pure and simple. That is why we are here today. Several years ago, it was a huge debate. Now, over the years, it has come to be virtually a nonissue. It is virtually a nonissue because the vast majority of Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, and Presidents, Republicans and Democrats, know that to do otherwise would cause a tremendous upheaval of our relationships with a very important country--in this case, China. 
   I think it is important as we enter the next millennium that we deal with other countries with tremendous respect, recognizing that countries have interests. China has its own interests, and the United States has its own interests. The real question is how do we get along better with each other, in a way that accommodates American points of view. 
   The basic policy, as announced by the Presidents over time, has been engagement. I say it is basically engagement without illusions; that is, we talk with countries, but we are realistic about what they do or do not do. But we do not cut off something that is very basic, something that we grant to virtually every country in the world, including a lot of others that I can name that have foreign policies and internal policies that are inimical to the United States, but nevertheless we think to deal with those countries, it is best to maintain the current trade relationship with them. 
   One of the huge adverse consequences that have been caused by this in the past would be the clear setback of negotiations between the United States and China over China's membership in the World Trade Organization. That is a clear winner for the United States, as long as it is done on commercially acceptable principles. The last agreement that Premier Zhu tabled for the 
   United States when he was in Washington not too long ago was clearly in the United States best interest. Why? Because it was unilateral. 
   In every case, it was China that was making concessions. It was China opening up its markets to American products. It was China that changed its distribution system. It would be China that would agree to--a much more fancy term is ``transparency''--much more openness, which undermines corruption, which undermines favoritism. It brings the Chinese economy much more into the modern world. 
   If this resolution were to pass, I will bet my bottom dollar we would have no WTO this year, and probably not for the next couple of years. Then the relationship with China, if you think they are risky now, would make today's relationship look like a cake walk. We have China's difficulties with Taiwan. They will be there for the indefinite future. 
   There are problems we have now with China over the tragic, mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. We have very deep human rights concerns. We have concerns about China's--in the past, anyway--transfers of missile technology, and perhaps nuclear weapons, to rogue nations. 
   But let's remember, China has taken a lot of actions which have been very helpful to the United States. What is one? 
   China abstained at the U.N. Security Council when we wanted the Security Council resolution on Kosovo. China could have caused all kinds of problems and could have vetoed that Security Council resolution but did not. 
   China also signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. They have signed it. As far as we know, they have not violated it. 
   They helped us in the gulf war, particularly by their actions with the Security Council. They helped with North Korea and the problems we have with North Korea, and particularly the greater potential problems we might have if North Korea starts sending missiles farther out into the Pacific. 
   But if this resolution passes, all those problems I mentioned are going to be exacerbated and all the good points I mentioned will become irrelevant and not helpful in our relationship with that country. 
   It is a very important country to deal with in a very solid, commonsense way. China is the largest country in the world. China has the largest freestanding army in the world. China has the largest population in the world. China is a nuclear power. China is the fastest growing developing country in the world. It is a major power. We can't close our eyes to China. 
   I am not saying we should accept what China is doing. I am not saying we should accept what any country is doing that is adverse to American interests. But I am saying that we have to, with eyes wide open, look at China and engage China without illusion. That is the policy. 
   If this resolution were to pass, believe me, we would be disengaging  China. China would be so upset--and they should be, if it were to pass--and we would be dealing with China as an enemy and not as a country that is separate from us. 
   There is an old saying in life that if you stick your finger in somebody's eye and you treat somebody like the enemy, guess what. They are going to be an enemy; they will react adversely. That is exactly how this would be recognized if it were to pass. 
   There is another important point. It is procedural. Procedural matters, I might add, are not unimportant. This measure has been reported out of the House Ways and Means 
   Committee unfavorably. So it is highly likely that this resolution will not come over to the Senate. If that is the case, why are we going through all of this? It doesn't make any sense. 
   I suggest, with deep respect to the other body, and with deep respect to my friend from New Hampshire and to my fellow colleagues, that if it comes up in the House, despite the recommendation of the House Ways and Means Committee, they pass the resolution, and it comes over here, then we will take it up and we will debate it. But it is premature to take it up at this time when it is clear, because of the House vote, that it will not pass the House and therefore will not be ripe as an issue over here. 
   But the fundamental reason is that this resolution, if it were to pass, would cause many more problems than the purported solutions that lie under the premise of this motion. 
   Again, all Presidents who have looked at this issue and all Congresses that have looked at this issue have reached the same conclusion--Republican and Democrat--that continuing the grant on an annual basis of unconditioned, normal trade relations with China will create the foundation and the condition for a much greater probability that we are going to achieve the success we want with various other issues that we have with China. 
   I oppose this move to discharge the Finance Committee from considering the resolution to disapprove extension of Jackson-Vanik waiver authority for China. It is an unnecessary attempt to alter a process that has worked well in providing for Congress' role in the annual NTR debate. 
   America's economic and trade relations with China have developed significantly over the past decade. I fervently hope that we will be able to resume WTO negotiations with China, complete a good commercial agreement, and extend permanent NTR quickly and in time for China to join the WTO in November in Seattle. 
   This is important for our businesses, important for our workers, and important for our country. I have no illusions about the serious problems we have with China, whether it is human rights, arms proliferation, espionage, Taiwan, or other areas. But using NTR, whether it is the annual extension or the permanent granting of that status, is not an effective way to influence China and move them in a direction we would like to see that society go. It holds our economic interests with China hostage to other aspects of the relationship. We need to regularize and normalize our trading relationship with China. We need to put predictability and stability into that trading relationship so that our industries can improve their ability to do business with China. 
   This resolution to discharge, although seemingly procedural, has an intent that damages our businesses, our workers, our farmers, and our Nation. I urge my colleagues to reject this effort. 
   I see my colleague. I guess he is going to yield time to one of our colleagues.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today requires that the United States Trade Representative, the USTR, appear before the Finance Committee in the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee in the House, on the day that the National Trade Estimates Report is released. 
   USTR must deliver the NTE Report to the Committees. He or she must provide an analysis of the contents of the NTE Report. And they must outline the major actions that will result from the NTE findings or give the reasons for not taking action. 
   The NTE is an important document. It is the major opportunity each year for the Administration to set out the key trade barriers we confront with our major trade partners. 
   At present, our trade law requires merely that USTR report the NTE to the President, the Finance Committee and the appropriate committees in the House. The change I am proposing means that the NTE will be made public on Capitol Hill rather than at USTR. The U.S. Trade Representative will present both its analysis of the trade barriers and its plan of action to deal with those barriers. That presentation will be made directly and immediately to the Congress. USTR should also explain what they have done over the past year to address trade barriers listed in the prior year's report. 
   This is a small change, but an important symbolic one. 
   The NTE should be the plan of action the Administration will pursue to dismantle foreign trade barriers. And USTR and the Administration must be accountable to the Congress for the results of this plan. 
   During twenty-nine years of service in the United States Congress, I have watched a continuing transfer of authority and responsibility for trade policy from the Congress to the executive branch. The trend has been subtle, but clear and constant. 
   I want to see this trend reversed. We in the Congress have a clear constitutional responsibility for trade. Article I of the Constitution reads: ``The Congress shall have power ..... To regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' I want to use this constitutional authority to provide more effective and active congressional oversight of trade policy. And I would like to see more congressional direction for the executive branch in the area of trade policy. 
   Again, this bill is a very small step in that direction. In the coming weeks and months, I will introduce further measures to ensure that the Congress implements fully its constitutional prerogatives on trade.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Species Conservation Tax Act of 1999. 
   The Endangered Species Act sometimes is referred to as our most important environmental law. However, it also is one of the most controversial. Over the past decade, a debate has raged about whether, and how, the Act should be revised. In 1995, Congress went so far as to impose a complete moratorium on the listing of species (fortunately, the moratorium has since been lifted). Several bills were introduced, and given serious consideration, that would have radically weakened the law. 
   On a more positive note, last Congress, after several years of work, the Environment and Public Works Committee reported a bipartisan bill, supported by the Clinton Administration, that would have made a series of modest, common-sense reforms to the Act. Unfortunately, that bill was never considered by the full Senate. 
   There seems, however, to be an agreement on at least one basic point: we should use more incentives to promote the conservation of threatened and endangered species, including tax incentives. For example, in 1995, a group organized by the Keystone Center reported that ``taxes, including income taxes, estate taxes, and property taxes, affect all landowners and sometimes significantly affect their land use decisions. Changes in tax laws, including some that have a relatively small cost to the Treasury, could yield important conservation benefits.'' 
   Over the years, we have made some progress. The tax code now contains two significant incentives for conserving land. One is section 170(h), which allows a charitable contribution deduction for donations of conservation easements in order to, among other things, preserve wildlife habitat. The other is section 2031(c), which, with the leadership of Senator CHAFEE, was enacted in 1997; it complements section 170(h) with an estate tax incentive to encourage the conservation of land for future generations. 
   The bill that I am introducing today builds on these provisions. It enhances the section 170(h) and section 2031(c) incentives, and it adds a new estate tax incentive for land that is managed to protect threatened or endangered species. 
   Let me briefly describe each provision of the bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his statement. He is on target. He raises an issue that so far this Congress has not dealt with. It is as precipitous, as calamitous, as tragic, frankly, as the Senator indicated. I very much hope that Senators heard the statement of the Senator from North Dakota. I also hope the White House heard his statement, and others, too. 
   I do not know exactly what the answer is, but I do know we need an answer. We need a solution to the problems our farmers are facing because the conditions he described in North Dakota are the same conditions one would find in my State, particularly the eastern half, which produces a lot of grain and some barley. But it is a wheat-producing area that is experiencing very difficult conditions.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge, and I very much appreciate, the action taken last week by the President in response to the recommendations of the International Trade Commission--otherwise known as the ITC--on relief for the American lamb industry. As you know, the industry has gone through very difficult times these last few years. Imports have surged dramatically and lamb prices have dropped precipitously. The package of trade relief and adjustment assistance announced by the President will help the industry adjust. It will allow our producers and feeders to keep their businesses and prosper in the future. 
   I am very grateful to the President and the staff of many agencies for their work on behalf of the American lamb industry and the American workers in that industry. 
   This was an important decision. Why? For several reasons. First, of course, it provides significant relief to the lamb industry, which is very important in my home State, as well as elsewhere in the Nation. Second, however, it demonstrates that section 201 of U.S. trade law can work. This is the so-called ``safeguard provision.'' It is designed to prevent serious disruption to the domestic industry whenever there is an import surge. 
   Third, the decision was important because I hope it shows a renewed commitment by the Clinton administration to assist American industries. This includes the agriculture sector that faces unprecedented challenges in the U.S. market for reasons not of their own making. 
   Section 201 has been little used in recent years. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have been reluctant to 
   agressively apply its provisions. For example, in the mid-1980s President Reagan would not follow an ITC recommendation for trade relief for the American footwear industry. 
   That failure was a major contributor to the introduction of many legislative proposals that could have significantly closed the American market to foreign products. American industries and workers--whether in manufacturing, agriculture, or services--must think the Federal Government will use all available tools to help them when they are challenged suddenly by surges in imports. This is especially important today, when global financial disruption can change competitive positions of countries overnight. 
   In the case of lamb, we see an industry that has been severely damaged by imports. Without relief, the injury to the industry would have continued to worsen. The number of sheep being raised is at an all-time low. Prices have dropped precipitously. Lending institutions are increasingly unwilling to extend credit. 
   The industry did what it was supposed to do. It used the domestic legal process authorized by the WTO. That process is enforced through section 201 of the U.S. trade law. This is how the process should work and, in this case, is working. 
   I believe the reluctance of the executive branch over the past 15 years to take action under section 201 has been a serious mistake. The most recent example of this is the late action that was taken by the administration to deal with the surge of steel imports. The volume of steel imports now seems to be under control. But we are still faced with a dilemma. How can we ensure that the next time the steel sector, or any other sector, is threatened by a precipitous spike in imports, strong and rapid measures will be taken to provide relief to those industries? 
   Earlier this session, I introduced the Import Surge Relief Act. It would improve and expedite the way our Government deals with import surges. It would ease the standard that must be met to demonstrate that there is a causal link between imports and injury to an American industry. It would  speed up the process for addressing import surges. It would provide for an early warning about import surges so action can be taken before the American industry is irreversibly damaged. All this is perfectly legal under the WTO. 
   Let me address a few remarks to the principal exporters of lamb to the United States--Australia and New Zealand. There has been a lot of misinformation coming from the industry and governments in those two countries. 
   This is not an attack on the lamb industry in Australia or New Zealand. Rather, it is a measure taken under U.S. trade law to provide temporary--and I underline the word ``temporary''--relief to a devastated American industry. The actions announced by the President are compatible with the WTO. Australia and New Zealand will continue to ship large quantities of lamb to the United States. Their exports would be able to grow each year. 
   The only difference is that the American lamb industry will stay in business and American workers will keep their jobs. Australia and New Zealand have the right to appeal to WTO. I am sure they will do that, and I am confident that the appeal will not be successful. Everyone should understand that this action was necessary to provide temporary relief to an industry that was hurting. 
   Let me conclude by again thanking the President and the administration officials who made possible this important action to provide remedies to the devastated lamb industry in the United States. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the dialogue we had between Senator GRAHAM from Florida and Senator FRIST from Tennessee. I think we are finally getting to the heart of the matter as to on why the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida really does make sense and why it saves money and at the same time helps the patients. 
   I point out that this amendment contains identical language that this Senate has already passed 2 years ago with respect to Medicare and Medicaid--the same language. I frankly think it would not be wise--in fact, I think it would be a mistake--if the Senate were now to turn around and adopt a lower standard of care for Americans with private health insurance plans. It just does not make any sense. 
   I must also say that both bills appear to provide coverage for emergency services using the prudent layperson standard. At least that is how it appears on the surface. The prudent layperson standard is the standard that guarantees emergency care without prior authorization in any case that a prudent layperson would regard as an emergency. Both bills appear to have that same standard. 
   The question here is something that is a little bit different. The difference comes down to poststabilization services. The amendment before us today does offer coverage for poststabilization services. The Republican bill does not. 
   What are poststabilization services? They are those services needed when a patient has been stabilized after a medical emergency. That is afterwards. 
   Really, the debate about poststabilization comes down to two basic questions: First, is poststabilization care going to be coordinated with the patient's health plan or is it going to be uncoordinated and therefore inefficient? 
   The second question is: Are decisions about poststabilization care going to be made in a timely fashion; that is, when they are needed, or are we going to allow delays in the decisionmaking process that will compromise patient care and also lead to overcrowding in our Nation's emergency rooms? 
   Those are the two basic questions. Again, are the poststabilization services going to be coordinated with the health care plan or not; and, second, are these decisions going to be made in a timely fashion? 
   We have heard a lot of rhetoric about how poststabilization services amount to nothing more than a ``blank check'' for providers. That is the major argument against this amendment. Is it going to provide for a ``blank check'' for doctors, for hospitals, and for emergency care providers? If these provisions are a ``blank check,'' I might ask, then, why did one of the oldest, largest, and most successful managed care organizations in the country, Kaiser-Permanente, help create them in the first place? 
   Kaiser-Permanente likes this because it knows it makes sense. It helps patient care and it helps reduce costs. Kaiser-Permanente is a strong supporter of the poststabilization provisions in our bill; that is, the provisions offered by the Senator from Florida. 
   Why does Kaiser-Permanente support this? One simple reason. They realize that coordinating care after a patient is stabilized not only leads to better patient care but--guess what--it also saves money. 
   Let me give you an example of how the poststabilization services in this amendment can actually save money. 
   Just last week, while the Senate was in recess, I learned of a 40-year-old woman who went to an emergency room complaining of numbness on the right side of her body. The symptoms began to improve in the emergency room, and she was diagnosed with what her physicians referred to as a ``mini-stroke'' or a ``TIA.'' This condition is a warning sign for the possibility of a more serious, debilitating stroke. 
   The patient was stabilized in the emergency room, and the emergency physician attempted to contact the patient's physician but was unable to do so. The emergency doc tried to contact the patient's physician but could not. If the poststabilization provisions in our bill had been in place, it may have been possible to send this woman home to continue her tests as an outpatient. It would have been possible. It would have been probable because of the way she was stabilized. 
   But because the plan and the private physician were not available to provide coordinated and timely followup care, the emergency physician had to admit the patient to the hospital. 
   Now, I am confused. Why don't some of my colleagues support this provision? Why don't they support a provision that provides a pathway to more efficient medical care? 
   Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for an additional 3 minutes.

   Mr. BAUCUS. In this case, the outcome is very simple. A patient could have been discharged to home with follow-up care as an outpatient. Instead, she was admitted to the hospital because timely follow-up care couldn't be guaranteed through the health plan. Her hospitalization costs were much higher than the care she would have received as an outpatient.  
   Now, I must say, too, we have heard many stories about the retrospective denial of coverage for poststabilization services. These services are not optional medical care. That is not what we are talking about. That is a red herring. We are not talking about optional medical care. We are talking about the situation where the emergency doc has time only to make sure the patient is taken care of, either admitted to a hospital poststabilization or coordinate a plan with the patient's doctor, some similar thing, not unrelated or just tangentially related optional medical care. That is a red herring. That is not what we are talking about. 
   If my colleagues support the Graham-Chafee amendment, it is clear they will be voting for more efficient and more timely medical care. I hope the Republicans will join us to pass the real prudent layperson standard for emergencies. This standard has bipartisan support. It is endorsed by many professional organizations and consumer groups throughout the country. 
   For example, just this afternoon I received an endorsement by the American Heart Association of the prudent layperson amendment offered by Senators GRAHAM and CHAFEE. The American Heart Association states that the prudent layperson standard is ``essential to their mission of reducing death and disability from cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in America.'' 
   The American Heart Association wants this amendment because they know it is right. Kaiser-Permanente wants this amendment because they know it is right. There is no reason why this amendment should not pass, particularly when the same standard applies today because of a law passed by this Congress 2 years ago, to Medicare and Medicaid. 
   I think it is common sense. I can't believe the objections to this amendment. I hope that after the other side thinks about it a little bit, they will realize that it does make sense and support it.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a friend and former colleague of many of us in this Chamber, Jim Sasser. Jim will complete his assignment as our Ambassador in Beijing this week, an assignment that has lasted forty months, longer than any previous American Ambassador to China. 
   After three terms in the Senate, including his excellent leadership as Chairman of the Budget Committee, Jim spent a year in the private sector before taking up residence in Beijing in February of 1996. Since then, Jim has watched over the U.S.-China relationship during an incredibly tumultuous period. 
   Jim arrived in Beijing just as the crisis began in the Taiwan straits in early 1996. Three years later, he watched over the first exchange of Presidential visits between our two countries when Jiang Zemin visited the United States and President Clinton paid a return visit to China earlier this year. I had the distinct honor to lead the Congressional delegation accompanying the President to China and can attest that I was profoundly impressed by Jim Sasser's understanding and management of this critically important and complex bilateral relationship. 
   Then, most recently, we all watched with great worry and anticipation as Jim was trapped inside the Embassy during the violent demonstrations against the United States. We saw him ably represent and defend American interests during that extremely difficult and tense week. 
   Jim Sasser has represented this country through the most difficult of circumstances. When Jim left the Senate, I was proud that to have served in this body with him. As he leaves China, I am proud that he was my country's representative there. I wish him the best and know that my colleagues do so as well.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when we look at Asia these days, Americans' primary focus is on China and the many difficult challenges that we face in that relationship. Next on our list of what we are watching in the region is Japan where our economic and security relationship remains the linchpin of our presence in Asia. These days, however, Japan seems to get scant attention from either the public or the policymaking community. That is a mistake, but I will leave that issue to another day. 
   After Japan in our focus comes the Korean Peninsula where we are concerned particularly about North Korea and its nuclear weapons development, missile technology, military adventurism, possible economic collapse, and internal instability. As we continue down the list of important things to think about in Asia, we come to Indonesia and the future of economic and political reform and internal stability in that hugely important nation. 
   Some may differ with my analysis, but it appears to me that, right or wrong, these days, our nation is looking at Asia in this way. 
   Today, however, I would like to call the Senate's attention to two important developments in other countries in Asia, specifically Southeast Asia, that are not on this list. These developments have been reported in our media, but, generally, on the back pages. They should not be ignored, because they relate to America's broad strategy toward the region where our interests are in security, stability, and open markets. 
   The two developments are the passage by the Philippine Senate of a U.S.-Philippine Visiting Forces Agreement and the progress being made toward completion of a U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement. 
   After a decade of stable democracy and economic reform, the Philippines may be the strongest economy in Southeast Asia after Singapore. Security ties, however, have remained at a very low level since the end of the base arrangement in 1991. This changed dramatically two weeks ago when the Philippine Senate ratified the new Visiting Forces Agreement. 
   This arrangement, typical of the relationship we have with many of our allies, allows us to apply U.S. military law to American soldiers and sailors overseas. Its ratification will permit us to renew joint military exercises, pay naval port visits, and develop a stronger and more cooperative relationship than we have had in the decade since we left Subic Bay and Clark Field. President Estrada and the Philippine Senate deserve great credit for their statesmanship in bringing these talks to conclusion. 
   The Visiting Forces Agreement also comes at an opportune time. Disputes between Southeast Asian states and China in the South China Sea are becoming more frequent. The financial crisis has forced most Southeast Asian nations to concentrate on internal economic issues. This agreement should give Southeast Asian countries more confidence in the U.S. commitment to the region, and, hence, serve as a long-term force for stability. 
   In the case of Vietnam, we appear to be getting close to a bilateral trade agreement, which will promote economic reform in Vietnam and allow us to grant them Normal Trade Relations status, NTR. 
   Vietnam, the fourth largest country in Asia and one that shares a land border with China, is an essential part of any regional policy. We have obvious historic sensitivities to address as we develop closer relations with Vietnam. We have taken a number of steps in the past few years--lifting the trade embargo, normalizing diplomatic relations, dispatching Pete Peterson as Ambassador, and concluding a Copyright Agreement, all in association with a commitment by Vietnam for full cooperation on resolving POW/MIA issues. As time passes, a normal and productive relationship with Vietnam will contribute immensely to stability and security in the southern Pacific. 
   We are now negotiating an agreement that would begin to open the Vietnamese market to foreign trade and investment. This will support economic reform and market opening in Vietnam while also creating new commercial opportunities for Americans in a market of 80 million people. The strategic implications of this agreement, which will move us down the road to a normal bilateral relationship with Vietnam, are important. It will strengthen Southeast Asia, reduce chances for conflicts in the wider Asian region, and place the United States in a stronger regional position. 
   Of course, an agreement must be meaningful in trade policy terms. It is not a WTO accession and, therefore, need not meet WTO standards, but it should include elements such as reform of trading rights and opening of key service sectors, in addition to other market-opening steps. For our part, if the Vietnamese are willing to conclude such an agreement, we should proceed rapidly to grant them Normal Trade Relations. This is in our trade and commercial interest, and also in our strategic interest. We have an opportunity to integrate Vietnam more fully into the Asian and world economies. I encourage our Administration, and the Vietnamese government, to complete the Commercial Agreement expeditiously. 
   We should, parenthetically, also proceed to Normal Trade Relations with Laos, where a trade agreement has already been completed. 
   The Philippine Visiting Forces Agreement and the bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, once completed, mean we have taken additional steps toward creating a post-Cold War framework involving open trade and security relationships in the Pacific. This is very much in our national interest.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to add my strong support to the Single-Point Tax Filing Act of 1999 introduced by my colleagues Senators KERRY and GRASSLEY. As a result of language I had included in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, Montana is the only state in the nation currently testing a Single-Point Tax Filing system, also known as the Simplified Tax and Wage Reporting System, or STAWRS. 
   The STAWRS pilot project in Montana has been a tremendous success. Earlier this year, the State of Montana and its Department of Revenue received a Regulatory Innovation Award from the Small Business Administration, the Commissioner's Award from the Internal Revenue Service, and the ``Hammer'' Award by the National Performance Review. These awards were all given in recognition of the pilot project's achievement in dramatically reducing paperwork and cutting red tape for small businesses. I was also honored to receive SBA's Special Advocacy Award for my efforts to have legislation enacted that allowed the pilot project to go forward. 
   The STAWRS program is designed to help businesses file their paperwork with one office, instead of wading through a blizzard of paper. It's one-stop shopping and will go a long way toward streamlining payroll information, making filing faster and easier. Right now, businesses find themselves reporting the same exact information, on wide variety of forms, to a range of state and federal agencies. This takes time and effort, both of which small business owners could put to much better use running their businesses. The STAWRS project is intended to eventually make it possible for employers to file a single, one-page report that is then shared by the appropriate revenue agencies. The governments will do the work and extract the information they need rather than the employer. 
   Small businesses are the engine for economic growth in this country. They have created close to two-thirds of America's net new jobs since the 1970's, helping drive our unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. All of this growth has been achieved despite the crushing paperwork requirements that small business owners face. The Single-Point Tax Filing Act gives us an opportunity to reduce this paperwork burden at no cost to the government. I am proud that Montana has taken the lead in reducing paperwork for small business, and strongly believe it should be made available to small businesses in every state, and on a permanent basis. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to urge my colleagues to allow an open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. For some time now we have been asking for this debate. Actually, we have been asking for about 2 weeks. Yet we still have not reached an acceptable agreement. 
   I return to the floor today to continue my discussion of a critically important provision in the Patients' Bill of Rights. This provision ensures appropriate coverage for emergency services according to the prudent layperson standard. Unfortunately, the alternative standard that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are offering falls short of the true prudent layperson standard. It is unfortunate that we are locked into a divisive debate, since I believe we could reach agreement on this provision. 
   We have already passed the prudent layperson standard for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries--a very important point. It is already in the law. Now we need to complete the task and offer the same protection for hard-working Americans with private insurance. 
   The bipartisan bill I cosponsored and the Democratic Bill of Rights contain the real prudent layperson standard for emergency services. What is the problem with the version of the prudent layperson standard proposed by those on the other side of the aisle? There are two weaknesses in their version. 
   First, it provides an inadequate scope of coverage for emergency services. The prudent layperson standard in their bill only applies to 48 million people. Both the bipartisan bill and the Democratic bill apply this support and protection to all 180 million Americans with private health insurance. 
   I heard arguments from the other side of the aisle that the Federal Government shouldn't get involved in private health insurance. The problem with that argument is simply this: We already are involved. Thankfully, we have made the decision that even if there is no other guarantee in our health care system, we will have guaranteed access to emergency services. 
   Health care that millions of Americans receive during emergencies is a safety net on which our system relies. Federal legislation already mandates this safety net. The prudent layperson standard in our bill--which, I might add, has bipartisan support--parallels the Federal mandate for emergency care. 
   If we fail to extend the prudent layperson coverage to all privately insured individuals, then we are choosing to continue an unfunded mandate. 
   The other major weakness in the prudent layperson provisions in the Republican bill is the lack of provisions for post-stabilization services. Mr. President I want to point out what the debate about post-stabilization services is all about. It simply boils down to two questions:

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I need to point out that this letter doesn't endorse all of the provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights. However, it strongly supports the post-stabilization provisions in our bill. I'll read a small portion of the letter:  
   In summary, this program has served the needs of our patients, the treating emergency physicians, and our own medical care teams, while providing substantial savings in both clinical expense and in administrative hassle over retrospective approval of payment for services provisionally approved through the telephone call. We are strongly in favor of the post-stabilization coordination provision as an essential element of the  emergency access provision of the Patients Bill of Rights.  
   Mr. President, I don't know how you can say it any more clearly than that. Our version of the prudent layperson standard for emergency services is the right one for several reasons:

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join my Democratic colleagues in their fight to have an open and unrestricted debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Over the past several days, we have heard the Republican leadership say they are interested in having an up-or-down vote on their bill, followed by a vote on the Democratic bill. We all know this is not how the Senate is supposed to work. We are a deliberative body, and as such, we should have debate on important issues that affect the lives of Americans. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights addresses one of the most important issues the Senate can debate: the rights of Americans to have access to quality health care. 
   Our health care system essentially relies on three important factors: First is access to health care; second is the quality of our health care; and third is  cost controls, that is, the cost of our health care. 
   The problem is it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have the best in all three areas. If we concentrate on two of the areas, that usually results in sacrifices in the third area. The whole reason we are trying to have this debate is that this trio of access, of quality, and of cost control has shifted out of balance. Our market-driven health care system has become too focused on controlling costs and protecting corporate profits. Although predictable, this, unfortunately, has led to sacrifices in access to health care and quality health care. 
   It is important to point out we do need to be concerned about cost control in our health care system, no doubt about it. 
   In fact, managed care has done many of the things we hoped it would do. For example, it has improved the efficiency of health care delivery, it has slowed down the growth in health care costs, and it has enhanced the collection of data to assess the quality of care. It has done all that, and that is good. 
   The message of this debate is not that managed care is the enemy. As I said, managed care has done a lot of things which are very important. This debate, rather, is about restoring a balance in our health care system. 
   We certainly could design a health care system that is only concerned about money, but that would miss the point. Unfortunately, though, we are headed in that direction. We need to stop and ask ourselves what we value in our health care system and what it means to have health insurance in America. That is why we want this debate so we can find answers to those questions. 
   I stand with my Democratic colleagues who have called for an open debate. One of the reasons an open debate would be helpful is there is room for compromise. In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bipartisan patient protection bill that I think strikes an important balance between the two sides which we have heard about in the last few days. 
   We need to come out of our corners and debate the issues because I believe there is an important middle ground, one that many Senators can support, if we simply have the courage to debate the provisions of these bills and let the votes fall where they may. 
   I want to address an important area in the Patients' Bill of Rights; that is, the provisions that address coverage for emergency services. Both the Republican and Democratic bills provide coverage for emergency services using a prudent layperson standard. Unfortunately, the Republican version of the prudent layperson standard falls short of the standard that Congress has already enacted for the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   This means that under that bill, hard-working Americans with private insurance will have less protection for emergency services than beneficiaries in Medicaid and Medicare programs. The bipartisan bill that I cosponsor and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights contain the real prudent layperson standard for emergency services. 
   What is the problem with the other version, that is, the Republican version of the prudent layperson standard? There are two important weaknesses in that standard. 
   First, that standard provides an inadequate scope of coverage for emergency services. We have heard a lot of discussion about the scope of coverage in the two bills over the last 2 days. The best example of why we need to have uniform protections for patients throughout the country is the prudent layperson standard. 
   The Federal Government is already involved in every emergency room visit in this country. We have strict Federal standards to protect patients with medical emergencies. These standards are embodied in the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act or EMTALA. It is hard to argue that the Federal Government should not be involved in protecting patients with medical emergencies when the Federal Government already is involved. 
   The prudent layperson standard in the Republican bill only applies to 48 million people. Both the bipartisan bill and the 
   Democratic bill apply this important protection to all 180 million people with private health insurance. We need to realize in the Senate, again, we have already mandated that anybody who goes to an emergency room should receive health care. That is mandated. We now have an opportunity to ensure that patients are not held financially hostage for the decisions they make in an emergency. There is broad bipartisan support for the patient-centered concept of the prudent layperson standard. Now we need to extend this scope of coverage so that it parallels the Federal statutes that are already on the books. 
   The other major weakness in the prudent layperson provisions in the Republican bill is the lack of provisions for poststabilization services. I want to point out what the debate about poststabilization services is all about. It simply boils down to two questions. 
   First, is poststabilization care going to be coordinated with the patient's health plan, or is it going to be uncoordinated and inefficient? 
   Second, are decisions about poststabilization care going to be made in a timely fashion, or are we going to allow delays in the decisionmaking process that compromise patient care and lead to overcrowding in our Nation's emergency rooms? 
   We have heard a lot of rhetoric about how poststabilization services amount to nothing more than a blank check for providers. If these provisions are a blank check, then why did one of the oldest, largest, and most successful managed care organizations in the world help create them in the first place? 
   Kaiser-Permanente is a strong supporter of the poststabilization provisions in our bill for a simple reason: They realize that coordinating care after a patient is stabilized not only leads to better patient care, it saves money. 
   Let me give an example of a case which took place in the past 2 months. It illustrates the problem quite nicely. 
   A woman came to an emergency department after falling and sustaining a serious and complex fracture to her elbow. The emergency physician diagnosed the problem and stabilized the patient. The stabilization process took less than 2 hours. Unfortunately, the patient's stay at the emergency room lasted for another 10 hours while the staff attempted to coordinate the care with the patient's health plan. 
   The plan was unable to make a timely decision about the care this patient needed. The broken bone in her elbow required an operation by an orthopaedic surgeon. The patient's health plan did not authorize the operation in the hospital where the patient was located. They denied this care because the hospital was not in its network, even though there was a qualified orthopaedic surgeon available. 
   After several phone calls, a transfer was arranged to another hospital. Unfortunately, the patient did not leave the hospital emergency room for almost 12 hours. 
   When the patient arrived at the second hospital, the orthopaedic surgeon looked at the complexity of the broken bone and decided he could not perform the operation. The patient, therefore, had to be transferred to a third hospital, where the operation was finally performed. 
   Let's look at the extra costs involved in this case. The patient had two ambulance rides and two extra evaluations in hospitals. The patient also laid in the emergency room with a painful broken bone for 12 hours before being transferred. During this time, the emergency room was very busy and the staff had to continue to care for new patients as they arrived. 
   So why did this occur? In this case, the problem occurred because the plan was unable to make a timely decision about the poststabilization care this patient needed. 
   This should not be how we in this country take care of patients with a medical emergency. I hope Republicans will join with us to pass a really prudent layperson standard for emergencies. 
   I urge my colleagues to allow us to have an open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to have this debate. Americans want protections in their health plans. Americans want a system that balances the needs for access, quality, and cost control in their health care. 
   Before I close, I just want to mention how delighted I am to hear my colleagues talk about the needs of the uninsured in America. If they are serious  about working to address the problem we have with 43 million uninsured Americans, I obviously look forward to working with them. Once we have established basic, uniform rights in health care, we should return to the equally important task of providing access to health care for the uninsured in America. 
   It seems important that universal access to adequate health care should be our goal. But unless we recognize the importance of rights in health care, our constituents may end up with access to a system that is indifferent to both their suffering and their rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act is a good measure. It has two major pieces. The first exempts flammable substances used as fuels, including propane, from the regulatory requirements of the Clean Air Act's risk management program. The second is the matter of public access to worst case scenario data. 
   The committee and all of Congress has heard the concerns of propane users and distributors. I have met with propane distributors from Montana on this subject. They feel that the burden imposed by the EPA's risk management program is costly and provides little public health protection. They have achieved some relief in court, but prefer, and this bill provides, a clearer statement of Congress' intent. 
   In the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress directed EPA to compile a list of at least 100 substances that ``pose the greatest risk of causing death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the environment from accidental releases.'' EPA was to consider the severity of acute health effects, the likelihood of releases, and the potential magnitude of exposure associated with accidental releases of a substance before putting it on the list. 
   I was a member of the conference committee on that bill. And, I believe that Congress did not intend that propane or flammables used as fuels would pass those tests and be listed. Congress was focused on preventing major toxic catastrophes, such as occurred in Bhopal, India, not the type of accidents that are covered by existing Federal or State fire safety or transportation laws. Because it was not Congress' intent that they be added, I am supporting removing them from the list. 
   As I mentioned during the committee's markup of S. 880, I wanted to be responsive to concerns of the firefighters and fire chiefs. They had hoped to get information on flammables used as fuels as part of the risk management program. But, as we discussed the matter further, it became clearer that their interests would be best served by the comprehensive GAO study we have placed in the bill on their information needs and the ability of Federal and State laws and programs to help them do their jobs. 
   The bill also directs the GAO to do an additional study on the status of changes to the National Fire Protection Association Code for propane (NFPA 58). This voluntary industry standard was often cited by members of the propane industry as sufficiently protective of the public so that no additional regulations were necessary. The GAO will report back on changes to NFPA 58 that will hopefully provide at least the same level of public benefit as would have been provided by the listing of propane under the RMP requirements. I look forward to seeing progress on NFPA 58 that is responsive to the fire fighting community. 
   I am pleased to note that we have been able to come to an agreement on a managers' amendment which is a substitute for section 4 of the reported version of S. 880. That was largely the Administration's proposal for providing appropriate public access to the sensitive 
   parts of the risk management plans. Our amendment will help the administration continue implementing the accident prevention provisions of  the Clean Air Act in a sensible way. The amendment balances the public's right to know information about extremely hazardous substances with the need to place some limits on access to that information to prevent terrorists and other criminals from misusing it. 
   Section 4 is a response to a potential threat identified by the administration and industry. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has testified before the Committee about its concerns that Internet posting of parts of the risk management plans (RMPs) required under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act could increase the threat of criminal or terrorist actions. The FBI is particularly concerned about the possible use of off-site consequence or worst case scenario information in the RMPs by terrorists to rank targets and maximize harm to the public. That section of the Act was created to help prevent incidents like the one in Bhopal, India, where 3,000 people died and 200,000 were injured due to a chemical plant disaster. 
   I thank Senators LAUTENBERG, CHAFEE, INHOFE and representatives of the Administration for their work in developing the managers' amendment and moving this process along. It represents a real bipartisan team effort. Senator LAUTENBERG and his staff were particularly helpful in achieving a balanced agreement on the risk management plan portions of the amendment. 
   In early May, the administration sent up a legislative proposal to create a more secure system for handling sensitive RMP information. The administration's hope was that Congress would act before June 21, 1999, because that is the statutory deadline under the Clean Air Act for significant users of extremely hazardous substances to submit their RMP information to EPA. The act directs EPA to make that information available to local emergency responders, the States and the public. Unless this bill or similar legislation is passed soon, with a retroactivity clause included, the Administration cannot limit public access to this sensitive information and would not be able to prevent it from getting on the Internet. The Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, requires this kind of information be made available to the public, since it is not classified or considered confidential business information. The RMP information is a truly new category of government information. 
   The committee approved the administration's proposal on May 11, 1999, with the understanding that changes would have to be made before it would be ready for the full Senate's consideration. Fundamentally, this managers' amendment is similar to the Administration proposal. They both establish a system for accessing RMP information which is separate and distinct from the usual FOIA process. However, the approach in the managers' amendment provides a one-year exemption from FOIA while regulations are developed to govern the handling of and access to worst-case scenario information. This rulemaking period is a recognition of the need to air the many issues rising from the creation of this new information access system. Concerns about it have been raised by the public, the States' Attorneys General, first responders, librarians and environmental groups, since the Administration proposal was approved. 
   To encourage an expedited rulemaking process, the FOIA exemption would be lifted if the rule is not completed within one year. In any event, the FOIA exemption would be lifted six years after enactment. This deadline ensures that Congress revisits and oversees the matter and 
   is in keeping with the probable obsolescence of any information technology developed to satisfy the security concerns of the FBI and the public access concerns of the EPA. 
   State and local government personnel and affiliated individuals who need the worst case information for the official use of detecting, preventing, and responding to chemical facility accidents and their off-site consequences would be assured of getting it during the rulemaking period and after the rule is issued. However, to limit the chances that this information could get on the Internet, these people would be required to exercise great care in their use and distribution of it. The same restrictions would be placed on qualified researchers. Guidance will be issued by EPA, as part of the rulemaking, describing the official uses of the sensitive RMP information. 
   The amendment establishes penalties for those who knowingly or willfully violate the restrictions on the dissemination of the sensitive parts of the RMP. There would be a two-tiered approach. People who knowingly misuse the information could be fined up to $5,000 for each infraction. People who violate willfully, meaning that they know what the law or regulations prohibit and proceed anyway regardless of potential consequences, could face fines up to $1 million per calendar year. 
   The Clean Air Act's risk management program was created by Congress to help prevent chemical accidents that can harm our communities. People living near chemical plants do not care whether an accident occurs because of operator negligence or criminal activity. They want to feel and be secure from such threats. That is why we are taking this step today. We want to reduce the opportunity that Internet dissemination of worst case scenario information could be used by criminals to cause terror or destruction. We have even included an emphasis on preventing criminal releases of extremely hazardous substances, to make it clear that these should be an important focus of the accidental release prevention program. 
   But, we also want to preserve the important incentive created by public knowledge about chemical accidents and their consequences. That knowledge encourages manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their processes and plant safety. That is why we have provided the maximum possible public access to RMP information in this amendment and the Clean Air Act. 
   The right-to-know effect has been very successful in reducing overall toxic emissions to air, water and land. Knowing more about the off-site consequences of these substances should encourage companies to build safer facilities and look for alternative manufacturing methods. After all, it is part of the general duty under section 112(r) for owners and operators of chemical plants ``to design and maintain a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent [accidental] releases.'' Clearly, measures which entirely eliminate the presence of potential hazards, through substitution of less harmful substances or by minimizing the quantity of an extremely hazardous substance, as opposed to those which merely provide additional containment, are the most preferred and would be most effective in reducing the risk of accidental releases. The amendment specifically authorizes EPA and the Department of Justice to help owners and operators develop voluntary industry standards to carry out the various objectives of the general duty clause. 
   Mr. President, we are prepared for final passage. I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I hope the House will take up this matter and send it quickly to the President.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his work on this piece of legislation. I think it is responsive to the concerns that we heard from the fire fighters and the other first responders. They are concerned about losing access to information that would have been included in RMPs for those substances exempted by this bill. The RMP information was intended by Congress to aid emergency responders and communities in the prevention of loss of life and property that might occur due to accidental releases of hazardous substances. The component of the RMPs of greatest interest to the emergency responders is the hazard assessment required by section 112(r)(7)(B)(ii)(I).

   Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with my colleague, but NFPA 58 does not currently require the development of hazard assessment or off-site consequence analysis information. NFPA 58 also does not make specific provision for communicating or sharing this information with local emergency response authorities or personnel. Another problem with the NFPA Code is that state fire protection codes laws refer to NFPA 58 as of a certain date. Therefore, when the Code is updated, state laws do not automatically reflect subsequent changes to it.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I believe these reports will be of great help to firefighters and other emergency responders in looking at the adequacy of the information they need and get to do their jobs well. If the reports come back showing that the Federal government has not done its share to make their job of protecting the public easier, then this committee and others should take quick action to address any gaps in the system.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, along with Senators LAUTENBERG, LINCOLN, and DASCHLE, I am introducing legislation to reauthorize and reform the Superfund program, the Superfund Litigation Reduction and Brownfields Cleanup Act. 
   The Environment and Public Works Committee has been working on Superfund reauthorization legislation for more than six years. It's time to finish the job. To my mind, the best way to accomplish this is to focus on a set of modest but important reforms about which we are likely to be able to achieve a broad bipartisan consensus. 
   That is what our bill aims to do. 
   Superfund has been criticized as creating disincentives for cleaning up ``brownfields''--generally, sites in older neighborhoods or industrial areas that are contaminated, but not to the extent that they are likely to be put on the National Priorities List. The main charge is that fear of Superfund liability makes some developers reluctant to invest. 
   Title I of the bill addresses this concern. It eliminates Superfund liability for prospective purchasers of contaminated property who are not responsible for the contamination, and thereby removes a potential disincentive for brownfields cleanup. The bill also provides liability relief for current owners of contaminated property who are not responsible for and had no reason to know of the contamination when they acquired the property, and persons whose property is contaminated as a result of migration from neighboring property. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes funding for three purposes: 
   $35 million per year for five years for grants to local governments, States and Indian tribes to inventory and assess contamination at brownfield sites; 
   $60 million per year for five years for grants to local governments, States and Indian tribes to capitalize revolving loan funds and for site cleanup; and 
   $15 million per year for five years to States to develop and enhance voluntary cleanup programs. 
   Perhaps the most well known criticism of Superfund relates to the toll it can take on small businesses that, despite their often minimal contribution of waste to a site, have been forced to incur significant sums in attorney fees and payments toward cleanup. A significant portion of small businesses that sent waste to a site sent only municipal waste or very small amounts of hazardous waste. In addition, many small businesses simply cannot afford to pay the costs associated with retaining an attorney and cleanup. 
   To address these problems, the bill provides two liability exemptions. 
   The first is an exemption for parties that sent a de.micromis amount of hazardous waste--presumed to be less than 110 gallons of liquid material or 200 pounds of solid material. (Note that  this provision is not limited to small businesses: it also would exempt a large company that sends only de.micromis amounts of waste.) 
   The second is an exemption for small business and homeowners that sent municipal solid waste from their home or business. There is no limit on the amount of municipal waste these parties sent. 
   In addition, the bill provides relief for those who sent a relatively small amount of hazardous waste, but more than allowed under the de.micromis exemption, and for small businesses with a limited ability to pay. Specifically, the bill provides expedited settlements for contributors of de.minimis amounts of waste and persons with a limited ability to pay. These provisions require EPA to make settlement offers as expeditiously as practicable to these parties. A party who contributed 1% or less of the waste to the site is presumed to be de minimis. 
   Together, these provisions would provide relief for virtually every small business and homeowner that should get relief. The bill also requires that EPA establish a small business Superfund assistance section within the small business ombudsman office of EPA. 
   Under Superfund, contributors of municipal solid waste and municipal sewage sludge have been sued, and in some instances, found liable, based on the fact that even municipal waste contains some small amount of hazardous substances. At sites with municipal waste (such as municipal landfills), frequently the majority of waste by volume is municipal waste, but the conditions that result in listing the site on the NPL were caused by the more toxic industrial waste. Hence, there has long been controversy as to whether contributors of municipal waste, and municipalities that own municipal landfills on the NPL, should be treated the same as contributors of other waste. 
   Last year EPA published a policy for settlements with municipal owners and operators of NPL landfills, and for public and private contributors of municipal waste. The policy was developed through negotiations with several municipal organizations. 
   Our bill codifies EPA's policy. Under the provision, municipalities that own or operate landfills that are on the NPL are entitled to settle for 20% of the cleanup costs at a site, and for 10% if they have a population below 100,000. Contributors of municipal waste, including municipalities and private parties, can settle for $5.30 a ton. This number was calculated based on the cost of cleaning up a municipal landfill that does not also have hazardous waste. 
   Title IV provides exemptions for contributors of certain ``recyclable material''--paper, plastic, glass, textiles, rubber (other than whole tires), metal and batteries--that meet specified conditions. It is virtually identical to the Lott/Daschle bill in the 105th Congress. In particular, I appreciate the work of Senator LINCOLN on this issue. 
   Contributions of orphan funding from the Superfund can mitigate much of the perceived unfairness of the joint and several liability system. Allocation pilot studies conducted by EPA revealed that the most important tool for achieving settlements, and in the process reducing transaction costs, is for EPA to offer some contribution of funding to offset costs attributable to parties that are unable to pay. 
   The bill authorizes $200 million per year for five years in mandatory spending to be used by EPA in cleanup settlements. It is so used to offset costs attributable to parties that are insolvent or defunct or otherwise unable to pay, or for other equitable purposes. This mandatory spending is conditional, however, on the Superfund cleanup program being appropriated at least $1.5 billion annually, exclusive of the $200 million for orphan funding. That so-called ``firewall'' is intended to ensure that cleanups are not sacrificed in order to pay orphan funding. Assuming the program is funded at the required level, EPA would be required to contribute $200 million per year to cleanup settlements. However, to maintain flexibility, EPA would have the discretion to determine how much of the $200 million to allocate to which sites. 
   The bill authorizes appropriations of $7.5 billion over five years, or $1.5 billion a year. At this level, EPA would be able to maintain the current pace of cleanups, which is resulting in the completion of construction at 85 sites a year. Now that we finally are making good progress in cleaning up sites, its important to maintain this pace. 
   On a related point, the bill continues to fund cleanups principally through the Superfund Trust Fund. In doing so, it assumes the reinstatement of the two Superfund taxes--the excise taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks and the corporate environmental tax of .12 percent of corporate alternative minimum taxable income above $2 million. By doing so, the bill would retain the current reliance on the trust fund to pay for the majority of cleanup costs, with a limited payment from general revenues. 
   Mr. President, the chairmen of the Environment and Public Works Committee and its Superfund Subcommittee, Senators CHAFEE and SMITH, also have introduced a Superfund reform bill, S. 1090. There are several areas of general agreement between the bill that we are introducing today and S. 1090. Some examples are the exemption for bona fide prospective purchasers and other exemptions intended to promote brownfields redevelopment; exemptions for contributors of recyclable material; and exemptions and expedited settlements for contributors of municipal waste or small amounts of hazardous waste, to protect municipalities and small businesses. 
   There are, however, some significant differences between the approaches taken in the two bills, particularly with respect to providing an adequate federal safety net to protect public health and the environment, the allocation system, and, perhaps most significantly, providing adequate and assured funding to operate the program. 
   I hope that we can work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve these differences, so that we can pass a Superfund reauthorization bill with broad, bipartisan support.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators BINGAMAN, DORGAN, KERREY, JOHNSON, and DASCHLE. I rise to introduce the Trade Injury Compensation Act of 1999. 
   Under U.S. trade law, we may retaliate when a trading partner improperly closes its market to American goods or services. In certain circumstances, the World Trade Organization endorses that retaliation. The normal form of trade retaliation is to increase the tariff to one hundred percent on a designated list of imported goods. 
   The intention of retaliation is not protectionist. It is just the opposite--use the leverage of access to the huge United States market to open up a foreign market and expand trade. Retaliation is a tool designed to inflict enough economic pain on a trading partner that he returns to the negotiating table and removes the trade barriers that started the problem in the first place. Sometimes these negotiations restart quickly, sometimes even before the retaliation goes into effect. Other times, the negotiations start again only after the impact of retaliation sinks in. 
   In some cases, the new one hundred percent tariff raises the price of the imported good so prohibitively that it is priced completely out of the market. In other cases, the product is still sold in the United States, perhaps at a higher price, or perhaps at the original price with the importer absorbing the added tariff. 
   The United States is increasingly taking trade disputes to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. However, some of our trading partners have been, in effect, snubbing their nose at the WTO's decisions. The most egregious example of this is the European Union, whose approach to WTO dispute  settlement is, frankly, outrageous. First, in bananas, and now in beef, the EU is using legal and procedural technicalities to delay implementation of important and legitimate WTO panel decisions. Each time they do this, the EU seriously undermines the credibility of the WTO as a fair and even-handed place to get trade justice. 
   The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using the tariffs imposed when a country fails to comply with WTO dispute resolution decisions. Normally, the additional tariff revenues received from retaliation go to the Treasury. This bill establishes a trust fund so that the affected industry will receive those revenues as compensation for its injury. 
   In the case of agriculture, the money will be spent on promotion and development of products for the industry. In non-agriculture cases, the money will go to additional Trade Adjustment Assistance payments to the affected industry. 
   Mr. President, the WTO is a critically important institution that sets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow. We all recognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of my colleagues, are working on ways to fix it, starting with the WTO Ministerial in Seattle. But, while the United Staes is striving to support and improve the WTO system, the EU seems to be working overtime to undercut the WTO. We must stop this abuse of the WTO, and we must provide assistance to our industries that are damaged by these illegal actions of the EU or others in the future. 
   Within two weeks, the Administration will implement retaliatory measures against the European Union because of its WTO-illegal restrictions on beef. My bill would provide the American beef industry with much needed compensation while the retaliatory measures remain in place. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the surging wave of cheap, imported lamb meat that threatens to drown the United States lamb industry, an industry that has been part of our nation's economy since independence. 
   This surge of imports, primarily from the nations of Australia and New Zealand, can be seen in the numbers collected by our federal inspectors. 
   In 1993, just 56 million pounds of lamb meat entered this country and its markets. 
   By 1997, that figure had risen to 84.4 million pounds--a shocking increase of nearly 50 percent. 
   Those figures have been converted to carcass-weight equivalents, and are higher than those collected by the U.S. Commerce Department. But that department's information shows no indication that the surge is slowing. In 1998, a record 70.2 million pounds--by volume--of lamb meat entered the domestic market. 
   Not only has the level of imports increased, but the lamb meat flooding the domestic market is directly competitive with products produced by this nation's lamb industry. 
   In place of lamb carcasses, shipments of fresh, chilled meat--cut and processed and ready for the grocery store shelves--are displacing domestically produced meat across the country. 
   At this point, importers control one-third of the United States lamb consumption, a market share that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for our producers to control their own destinies. 
   The importers do not participate in voluntary price reporting. In fact, they have actively fought a joint lamb promotion program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   Despite ample notice of the effect their skyrocketing levels of imports have had on the domestic industry, and despite ample notice that the industry intended to file a case against them, the importers refused to pull back voluntarily, or even discuss the situation.  
   The lamb industry's case now rests with the President. I call on this Administration to follow through with the strong and effective relief this industry needs to regain its footing and confidence. With confidence will come investment, and with investment, will come a more competitive industry.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of a bipartisan group of 30 Senators, this morning I sent a letter to President Clinton expressing our view that bilateral negotiations with China over accession to the World Trade Organization should be resumed immediately and finalized quickly. After completion of an agreement that clearly advances U.S. economic interests, we are committed to granting China permanent Normal Trading Relations (NTR) status. 
   It is critical, especially after the events in Belgrade and Beijing over this past week, that we understand what is in America's national interest. It is in our national interest to ensure that China is incorporated into the global trade community through membership in the WTO. It is in our national interest to make sure that China follows internationally accepted trade rules. It is in our national interest to improve market access and open China's markets to American agricultural products, services, and manufactured goods. And it is in our national interest to do what we can to help anchor and sustain the economic reform process currently underway in China. 
   As I look at the Senators who signed this letter, I see a broad representation of our country, our society, and our economy. The nature of this group, half Democrat and half Republican, demonstrates that there is strong and broad support in the Senate for us to focus on America's long-term national economic interests in developing our trading relationship with China. We cannot, we must not, and we will not, ignore the many problem areas in the broad U.S.-China relationship, from human rights to espionage to weapons proliferation. But the message is clear that we must look closely at every aspect of this relationship in an objective way, determine what is best for us as a nation, and act accordingly. 
   The agreements reached during Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Washington are solid. We want no back-pedaling on those understandings. We want an early resumption of the trade negotiations and a rapid conclusion. We want to bring China into the global trade community, and to do so it is necessary to grant China permanent normal trading relations status. The broad bipartisan group of Senators who signed today's letter firmly supports that. 
   Let me be clear about the intended recipients of the message in this letter. We want the administration to know that a core bipartisan group in the Senate is behind resumption of negotiations and conclusion of a WTO agreement, and that group will support permanent NTR status for China. We want the most senior levels of the Chinese government to know that a good WTO agreement with the United States will lead rapidly to WTO accession and to permanent NTR status. We want the American public to understand that we in the Senate are taking strong leadership in promoting the long-term economic interests of this country. 
   And we want the American business community to know that they have responsibilities: first, to work ceaselessly to take advantage of the concessions China will make as it enters the WTO, second, to expand exports to China that will grow jobs in the United States, and, third, to educate the public and policymakers about the importance of integrating China into the global economy. 
   The terms negotiated by USTR, the Department of Agriculture, and others are excellent. These are structural changes, market opening measures, and trade concessions made by China, not by the United States. We, the United States, are giving up nothing and are obtaining immeasurable possibilities for the future.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very important event. 
   All over the country, women and men alike are preparing for the ``Race for the Cure,'' a 5-kilometer foot race to raise money in the fight against breast cancer. Each year, the number of participants in the race has grown. Sixteen years after its inception, the Race  for the Cure has become the largest 5-K in the world. 
   I believe this race is widely attended because breast cancer has affected so many people. One in 9 women and approximately 12,000 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. So, in some way, everyone--every man, woman, and child is affected by this disease. The Race for the Cure is important because it brings awareness to this disease that is so prevalent today. 
   This cause and this race are important to me for many reasons. There are several women who are very important to me who are survivors of this terrible disease. I have learned so much from these women; I have seen their courage and, believe me, I want to underscore that point--very courageous. I have seen their willingness to fight. Through them, I have learned more about the value of life. 
   We often take for granted the gifts that we have been given. We catch ourselves thinking about what will happen in an hour, or in a couple of days, and we forget to live for right now. The precious time that we have with our loved ones is invaluable. We take too little time with them. Through their struggles to fight breast cancer, these women have shown me the importance of a life lived well. And for that, I thank each of them. 
   This race is being held in over 95 cities in the United States over the next few weeks. I am proud to say that this weekend, on May 15, the Race for the Cure will be held in Helena, MT, my State's capital. Approximately 3,000 runners will participate. More important, over 300 breast cancer survivors will participate this weekend in the race for life. 
   Seventy-five percent of the race proceeds are used to provide mammography vouchers and grants for follow-up diagnostic tests for more than 600 women in Montana. Thirty-two health care facilities in my State participate in this program. 
   I extend my special thanks to the Montana Race organizers Connie Malcom and Bobbie Pomroy and the hundreds of volunteers working together to make this important event occur. Women like Jan Paulsen, a seven-year survivor who will represent my State at the National Race for the Cure here in Washington, DC, on June 5. 
   Congratulations to everyone involved in this important event and good luck to all! 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator CHAFEE and a bipartisan group of our colleagues from the Finance Committee in introducing the Structured Settlement Protection Act. 
   Companion legislation has been introduced in the House (H.R. 263) by Representatives CLAY SHAW and PETE STARK. The House legislation is co-sponsored by a broad bipartisan group of Members of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
   The Treasury Department supports this bipartisan legislation 
   I speak today as the original Senate sponsor of the structured settlement tax rules that Congress enacted in 1982. I rise because of my very grave concern that the recent emergence of structured settlement factoring transactions--in which favoring companies buy up the structured settlement payments from injured victims in return for a deeply-discounted lump sum--complete undermines what Congress intended when we enacted these structured settlement tax rules. 
   In introducing the original 1982 legislation, I pointed to the concern over the premature dissipation of lump sum  recoveries by seriously-injured victims and their families:  
   In the past, these awards have typically been paid by defendants to successful plaintiffs in the form of a single payment settlement. This approach has proven unsatisfactory, however, in many cases because it assumes that injured parties will wisely manage large sums of money so as to provide for their lifetime needs. In fact, many of these successful litigants, particularly minors, have dissipated their awards in a few years and are then without means of support. [CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (daily ed.) 12/10/81, at S15005.]  
   I introduced the original legislation to encourage structured settlements because they provide a better approach, as I said at the time: ``Periodic payment settlements, on the other hand, provide plaintiffs with a steady income over a long period of time and insulate them from pressures to squander their awards.'' (Id.) 
   Thus, our focus in enacting these tax rules in section 104(a)(2) and 130 of the Internal Revenue Code was to encourage and govern the use of structured settlements in order to provide long-term financial security to seriously-injured victims and their families and to insulate them from pressures to squander their awards. 
   Over the almost two decades since we enacted these tax rules, structured settlements have proven to be a very effective means of providing long-term financial protection to persons with serious, long-term physical injuries through an assured stream of payments designed to meet the victim's ongoing expenses for medical care, living, and family support. Structured settlements are voluntary agreements reached between the parties that are negotiated by counsel and tailored to meet the specific medical and living needs of the victim and his or her family, often with the aid of economic experts. This process may be overseen by the court, particularly in minor's cases. Often, the structured settlement payment stream is for the rest of the victim's life to ensure that future medical expenses and the family's basic living needs will be met and that the victim will not outlive his or her compensation. 
   I now find that all of this careful planning and long-term financial security for the victim and his or her family can be unraveled in an instant by a factoring company offering quick cash at a steep discount. What happens next month or next year when the lump sum from the factoring company is gone, and the stream of payments for future financial support is no longer coming in? These structured settlement factoring transactions place the injured victim in the very predicament that the structured settlement was intended to avoid. 
   Court records show that across the country factoring companies are buying up future structured settlement payments from persons who are quadriplegic, paraplegic, have traumatic brain injuries or other grave injuries. That is why the National Spinal Cord Injury Association and the American Association of Persons With Disabilities (AAPD) actively support the legislation we are introducing today. The National Spinal Cord Injury Association stated in a recent letter to Chairman ROTH of the Finance Committee that the Spinal Cord Injury Association is ``deeply concerned about the emergency of companies that purchase payments intended for disabled persons at drastic discount. This strikes at the heart of the security Congress intended when it created structured settlements.'' 
   As a long-time supporter of structured settlements and an architect of the Congressional policy embodied in the structured settlement tax rules, I cannot stand by as this structured settlement factoring problem continues to mushroom across the country, leaving injured victims without financial means for the future and forcing the injured victims onto the social safety net--precisely the result that we were seeking to avoid when we enacted the structured settlement tax rules. 
   Accordingly, I am pleased to join with Senator CHAFEE in introducing the Structured Settlement Protection Act. The legislation would impose a substantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases structured settlement payments from an injured victim. There is ample precedent throughout the Internal Revenue Code, such as the tax-exempt organization area, for the use of penalties to discourage transactions that undermine existing provisions of the Code. I would stress that this is a penalty, not a tax increase--the factoring company only pays the penalty if it undertakes the factoring transaction that Congress is seeking to discourage because the transaction thwarts a clear Congressional policy. Under the Act, the imposition of the penalty would be subject to an exception for court-approved hardship cases to protect the limited instances of true hardship of the victim. 
   I urge my colleagues that the time to act is now, to stem as quickly as possible these harsh consequences that structured settlement factoring transactions visit upon seriously-injured victims and their families.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Again, I thank my good friend from Minnesota, as well as the Presiding Officer from Wyoming, who was very generous in allowing us to proceed at this time. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Import Surge Relief Act of  1999, an important measure that will provide a new and improved way to deal expeditiously with import surges. A sudden increase in imports in any sector, especially when these imports are shipped to us at rock bottom prices, has done grave damage to American business and American agriculture. This has been true in the past. It is true today. And, given the increased volatility that we see in the global trading and financial system, import surges are likely to create even greater havoc in our economy in the future. 
   The steel industry and its workers have been seriously injured, and we read about these stories almost daily. The agriculture industry and our farmers and ranchers face constant threats from surges in wheat, beef, lamb, pork and more. At a time when our rural and industrial communities are facing an all-time crisis, this damage goes to the very heart of our economy and our society. 
   The Import Surge Relief Act makes several critical improvements in Section 201 of U.S. trade law. This is the so-called ``safeguard'' provision that is designed to prevent serious disruption of our domestic industry because of imports. The improvements I am proposing include the following: 
   Easing the standard that must be met to demonstrate that there is a causal link between imports and injury to the U.S. industry, speeding up the process for addressing import surges, an absolutely critical need to prevent an industry from being devastated before action is taken, requiring that the President, in deciding whether to take action, focus more than he has in the past on the beneficial impact of a remedy, rather than on the negative impact on other industries, making provisional relief available on an urgent basis, and correcting the way in which imports are counted to prevent circumvention. 
   In addition, the bill provides for a system that will give us an early warning about import 
   surges. We simply cannot wait until we see that an America industry is devastated. We must be able to project ahead, understand the threats facing an industry, and then consider quickly what type of action to take, if any. 
   Finally, the bill requires that there be an investigation about underlying problems in agricultural and steel trade. This investigation would focus on anti-competitive practices overseas, including cartel arrangements beyond the borders of the United States. 
   Mr. President, the United States will remain the most open market in the world. I am committed to that. At the same time, we must do everything we can to open foreign markets that retain barriers to our manufactured goods, agricultural products, and services. And, we must be sure that our domestic industry is able to adjust and adapt to import surges without experiencing the devastation to our businesses, farms, and communities that we have seen far too often in the past. 
   Let me discuss the Import Relief Act in more detail. 
   The bill changes the causation standard that links imports and injury. Instead of the requirement that imports be a ``substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof'', this bill requires only that imports cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury. Imports would not have to be the leading, or most important, cause of injury. This change conforms to the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999. 
   All Americans deserve access to quality health care. But in rural America health care delivery is often difficult, given the great distances and extreme weather conditions that typically prevail. That's why Senator DASCHLE and I, along with bipartisan group of Senators, are introducing this important legislation. Its provisions are many, but it purpose is singular: to correct the federal government's tendency to view all areas--urban and rural--with a one-size-fits all lens. 
   Before I begin explaining what this bill does, I want to recognize the tremendous contributions of some of the cosponsors' staff who have worked on the bill. 
   The Minority Leader is known in the Senate not only for this tremendous leadership, but for the quality of his staff. Elizabeth Hargrave is no exception. On loan from the Department of Health and Human Services, she has worked tirelessly to see this bill through to introduction. With her expertise and attention to the intricate details of health policy, we have come up with a solid, comprehensive bill, much improved from that which was introduced last year. 
   Tom Walsh on the Senate Aging Committee has also done tremendous work. His knowledge of Medicare law is vast, and his parent demeanor has done wonders toward making negotiations on this bill amicable and fruitful. Heidi Cashman with Senator ROBERTS, Neleen Eisinger with Senator CONRAD, Diane Major and Stephanie Sword with Senator THOMAS, Sabrina and Bryan with Senator HARKIN, The list goes on. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act is the product of many long meetings, extensive research, and a great deal of cooperation. Would that we could all work so well together. 
   So why is this bill important? As you know, Mr. President, a couple of years ago Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. In it we extended the life of Medicare for several years and passed some important rural health provisions, including Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine and the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program to establish Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs). 
   Under the new CAH law, rural hospitals can convert to limited-service hospital status and received flexibility with Medicare regulations designed for full-size, full-service facilities. They are reimbursed by Medicare based on actual costs, not fixed or limited payments; in exchange, CAHs agree to a limit of 15 hospitals beds and patients stays of limited duration. The model for the new program was based largely on Montana's Medical Assistance Facility Program. CAHs show well the progress we can make if rural areas are afforded the flexibility to develop solutions to the problems they know best. They also illustrate a creative means by which we can use the Medicare program to keep rural hospitals open--and rural communities alive. 
   But not all of the Balanced Budget Act was positive for rural areas. Far from it. Montana health care facilities, including hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes, are suffering. 
   In 1997, even before the BBA cuts, small rural hospitals in Montana lost 6.5% treating Medicare patients. And although we do not yet have complete data on the impact of the BBA changes, anecdotal evidence tells me that the situation in rural Montana has gotten even worse. In rural areas where many, usually most, patients are of Medicare age, we cannot expect these facilities to stay open without paying them enough to break even. We must do something to ensure the integrity of our rural health care systems. 
   This bill is a good first step. Among other things, the bill provides rural communities with assistance in recruiting health care providers; expands the range of services that can be provided with telemedicine; increases payments to hospitals in rural areas; expands access to mental health services in rural areas; changes the formula by which managed care payments are calculated to attract more managed care health plans to rural areas; and increase rural representation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. 
   As Dennis Farney, a reporter from Kansas once wrote: ``A prairie is not any old piece of flat land in the Midwest. No a prairie is wine-colored grass, dancing in the wind. A prairie is a sun-splashed hillside, bright with wild flowers. A prairie is a fleeting cloud shadow, the song of the meadowlark. It is the wild land that has never felt the slash of the plow.'' For me, this conjures up images of an idyllic rural setting, far removed from the commotion of city life. And certainly that is in the minds of many who live in these sparsely-populated areas--that they are inhabiting a part of the world that is in many ways pristine and untouched. 
   Of course there is a price to pay for that. Rural folks should not expect to have all the amenities of city life: opera houses and professional sports teams are just a couple of things that rural areas must simply do without. Rural Montanans can't expect to have a subway system--or even a Subway sandwich shop for that matter--because economies of scale dictate as much. 
   And even in the area of health care, rural Americans realize they give up something. Full-service hospitals and dental clinics are the stuff of populated areas, and will probably remain so. But although you won't find a full-service acute-care hospital in Choteau, Montana, you can find a CAH. And though you don't find a full-service dental clinic in Eureka, you can find a rural health clinic. Rural residents cannot expect to have the most extensive health care facilities or access to the array of specialists typical of urban settings, but they should expect a minimum standard of quality care. This bill is a step in the right direction towards raising that standard. 
   Whether it's helping rural areas with highway dollars, preventing small post offices from moving to towns' outskirts, or keeping hospitals open, I think most of us agree that saving rural areas is something that ought to be done. Regardless of how hard we try, however, we cannot do so without ensuring the integrity of these communities' health care systems. I urge my colleagues to join the Minority Leader and I in doing just that.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to offer some thoughts on the negotiations towards China's WTO accession, in the aftermath of Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States. 
   This, I submit, is a question of fundamental importance to America's trade interests. China is now our fourth largest trading partner--after Canada, Japan, and Mexico--a major market, and the source of our most unbalanced trade relationship in the world. And it is perhaps still more important to America's strategic interests in Asia. Today, I would like to review the progress thus far and its implications for these interests. 
   Let me begin, however, with some context about WTO accessions and the commitments they require. 
   The WTO really began with the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, otherwise known as the GATT, in 1948. At that time, 23 nations were members. Each of them agreed to a set of tariff cuts and agreed to apply the new tariffs to all other GATT members. This is the famous, or infamous, principle of ``MFN,'' or ``Most Favored Nation.'' 
   Since then, since 1948, 111 other economies--membership is no longer restricted to countries, as Hong Kong and the European Union are now members--have joined to make up today's 134-member WTO. 
   The original tariff agreements are also joined by agreements on sanitary and phytosanitary standards--that is, health standards--intellectual property, technical barriers to trade, and other issues. And 30 more economies have applied to join, the largest being China. 
   As these economies join, they must also lower their trade barriers, live up to WTO's intellectual property and agricultural inspection commitments, and so forth. For existing members, however, the only requirement is the one they adopted back in 1948: that we apply MFN--or today normal trade relations--tariffs to the new members. That is the only commitment that current members have to make. 
   So as we consider the commitments China has and will make to be a WTO member, we must also remember that these are fundamentally one-way concessions. Let me repeat, to enter the WTO, China has committed to a set of one-way concessions. 
   Nothing in any WTO accession will mean American concessions on market access; the use of our trade laws to address dumping, subsidies, or import surges; or controls on American technology exports. Likewise, if we should choose to tighten export controls at some point in the future, nothing in the WTO accession would prevent us from doing so. 
   Let me now turn to the commitments China has made and to the issues which remain. 
   To enter the WTO, China and the existing members must do two things: draft a ``Protocol'' covering a set of fair trade policies, and agree on a set of market access concessions. 
   These are the issues which the American negotiating team addressed in the months and weeks before Premier Zhu's visit. 
   And the results are striking. China has made a significant set of concessions in both areas. The work is not done, but let me review for the Senate some of the major elements. 
   Under the protocol, China has made the following commitments: It will end the practice of requiring technology transfer as a condition for investment. That is very big. This includes refusing to enforce tech transfer provisions of existing contracts. The United States is guaranteed the right to continue using nonmarket economy methods for fighting dumping and unfair subsidies. 
   China will end investment practices intended to take jobs from other countries, for example, local content requirements which stop auto plants from importing U.S. parts; export performance clauses requiring production to be exported rather than sold on the Chinese market, and so on. And China has agreed to a product-specific safeguard which will strengthen our ability to fight sudden import surges. 
   It is important in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that these provisions have acceptable duration. But it is also clear both that we will be able to use the WTO to strengthen our guarantees of fair trade, and also that we will be able to use our own domestic trade laws for the same purpose. These are fundamental parts of any successful WTO accession. 
   The American negotiators have also won an impressive set of commitments in market access. Let me offer a few examples: In agriculture, China has already begun by lifting its infamous ban on Pacific Northwest wheat, American beef, and also on citrus products. And when it enters the WTO, it will accompany this by major tariff cuts. For example, beef tariffs will fall from 45 percent to 12 percent, and adoption of tariff-rate quotas in bulk commodities; that is, minimum guarantees of imports into China. 
   The wheat tariff-rate quota, for example, has the potential to lift China's imports from 2.4 million metric tons a day to 7.3 tons for the first year China is in the WTO and more afterwards. China will also give up any rights to export subsidies, a far cry from, say, Europe which has massive export subsidies; China going much, much further than Europe is today. 
   In industrial goods, China will grant full distribution rights, retailing, repair, warehousing, trucking and more in almost all products over 3 years. And it will allow American companies to import and export freely. These are concessions that will fundamentally transform an economy which now operates by requiring both Americans and Chinese to use Chinese Government middlemen in these areas. It will make large tariff cuts to an average of 7.1 percent, and it will give up the quota policies at the heart of several industrial policy ventures. 
   Another concession of special interest to my State of Montana is deep cuts in wood products, from levels reaching 18 percent today down to 5 and 7 percent after WTO membership. And in services, China has made commitments in every sector. They are especially strong, as I noted, in distribution, but also extend to telecommunications, to finance, to audiovisual, environmental services, law, franchising, direct sales and more. These are very significant concessions which go most of the way to creating a commercially meaningful agreement.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to note that this week the world's finance ministers and central bank presidents have gathered in Washington for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I suspect that Secretary of the Treasury Rubin reminded us last week that, despite the hype about the end of the world's financial crisis, we are just at the starting point of making those structural changes necessary to put the globe back on a solid growth path. 
   Obviously, it is critical to repair the global financial system, and Secretary Rubin has been the leader in this with excellent ideas. But there is a whole other piece, which we can't ignore; that is, the need to maintain and expand an open trading system. Take a look at some troubling trade statistics released last week. 
   First, the United States merchandise trade deficit in February hit an all-time record--over $19 billion. Imports into the United States are growing faster now than at any time in the last four years. Furthermore, American exports are lower than they were just one year ago. And remember that one billion dollars in exports equals about 12,000 jobs. 
   Japan and China seem to be in a race to see who will have the largest deficit with us. Japan's trade deficit with the United States in February was over $5 billion, while China's was a little under $5 billion. 
   There is more. Another troubling statistic was the World Trade Organization announcement that last year the world's exports grew only 3.5 percent. That compares to a 10.5 percent growth rate in 1997. And they expect the growth of world trade to slow down even further this year. 
   Third, and this is even worse news, while imports into North America were up 10.5 percent, our exports from North America, which means mainly the United States, rose only 3 percent last year. That is, imports rose three and a half times faster than exports. 
   All this means that the world economy is surviving by exporting a lot to us while importing less and less. 
   Why is this? 
   A major reason is that our economy is so much stronger today than any others. This is due to American economic strength and competitiveness, as well as to the global financial turmoil that has hurt so many of our trading partners. 
   But another significant reason for the growing trade deficit is the continuing discrepancy between the openness of our market versus the openness of others. It is true that once the world emerges from the financial crisis and global recovery begins to kick in, these numbers will change somewhat. However, the trade barriers that existed prior to the start of the global financial crisis are still there today and will still be there tomorrow. 
   If Secretary Rubin and other financial leaders succeed in their efforts, foreign economies will pick up later this year or next. We should see an increase in our exports as those economies need American capital goods and start buying more consumer products. But, economic recovery overseas does not mean that trade barriers will disappear. We must deal aggressively with barriers to our goods and services to take advantage of this opportunity for greater export growth. 
   That is why we must always keep market opening and trade liberalization on the top of our national agenda, aggressively negotiating new agreements, insisting on full implementation of existing agreements, and repairing those aspects of our trade law that are not working. 
   Our farmers, manufacturers, and service providers are the most efficient in the world. They must have the same freedom to do business overseas that foreign businesses have in our country. And it is the duty of the Congress and the Administration to ensure that those opportunities exist. 
   We have all been pretty frustrated by the European Union's unwillingness to abide by WTO decisions on beef and bananas. In fact, Europe's reaction to the WTO beef hormone decision is to become even more protectionist. We have also been frustrated by Japan's unwillingness to implement its trade agreements with the United States. A recent study concluded that Japan was implementing fewer than one-third of those agreements. 
   One possible bright side to this picture, however, lies in the WTO negotiations with China. USTR, USDA, and other agencies have done yeoman's work over the past month. I hope the agreements made thus far with China hold together and the negotiations underway can bring it to a conclusion. We have an opportunity to expand significantly American exports in many sectors--agriculture, manufacturing, and services, for example. Another example of this is the Pacific Northwest wheat agreement, which has been a problem for us in the Pacific Northwest. China now agrees that we will be able to sell our Pacific Northwest wheat to China. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that opening markets is profoundly important for our national well-being. But it requires persistent, aggressive, high-level attention at all levels of our government. I will do everything in my power to ensure that this is done. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Federally Impacted School Improvement Act. 
   As we all know, there is a very important debate going on in our country today concerning our Nation's schools. Schools all across our country are crumbling, in many cases in such disrepair that it affects the child's ability to learn or even feel safe. I hope and expect that this Congress will reach a consensus on a school construction bill very soon. 
   I support and have cosponsored several bills in the last Congress that encourage a nationwide effort to rebuild our public schools. Quite simply, it is the right thing to do. 
   But in a heated national debate, one group of children is continually left out in the cold; that is, students who live on federally owned land, usually an Indian reservation, very often a military installation. In my State of Montana, about 12,000 children are classified as federally impacted; that is, they live on Federal land. 
   For almost 50 years, Congress has provided financial assistance to school districts that are impacted by a Federal presence. We call this Impact Aid funding. Unfortunately, it has been underfunded for the last 15 years. And even worse, for the last 5 years Impact Aid schools have received zero dollars to help in paying for badly needed repairs and construction. 
   This has created an underclass of schools with glaring infrastructure problems that border on dangerous and inhumane. 
   How bad is it, you may ask? Let me tell you. 
   In one school in Montana, the Hays Lodge Pole Elementary School on the Fort Belknap Reservation, they say that the high school has infrastructure problems that are so bad that saying it has problems is like saying that the Titanic had a small leak. 
   Whenever it rains or snows, the roof leaks making classrooms unusable. The kindergarten is located on a stage, not in a classroom. The school nurse and counselor work out of a converted locker room shower with no ventilation. The decrepit sewage system regularly backs up into this same shower, filling the nurse's and counselor's office with raw sewage. And all special education services, which a large percentage of students use, are provided in a separate house requiring the children or staff to walk over an ice rink in high winds and adverse weather just to get to class. 
   While some may say, OK, that sounds like a bad deal, shouldn't the local taxpayers pass a mill levy to build a new school? Or shouldn't they get help from the President's school construction bill which gives billions of dollars in bonding 
   authority to school districts for just these sorts of problems? The answer, sadly, is no. 
   The problem is that these schools have no bonding authority. Since the land is owned by the Federal Government, there is no local mill levy to raise. And since the Federal Government has, for 5 consecutive years, provided zero dollars for repairing Impact Aid schools, these problems have just gotten worse and more expensive. And it is our children who pay the price. 
   So the Baucus-Hagel Federal Impacted School Improvement Act aims to fix that. Make no mistake, this is not some budget-busting Government handout. The act authorizes a small but meaningful $50 million a year appropriation for the next 5 years for Impact Aid school construction and repair. 
   And 45 percent of the funds appropriated under the bill go to Indian lands. Another 45 percent is dedicated to military schools. The final 10 percent is reserved for emergency situations. 
   In order to make this small appropriation go further, our bill requires local school districts to match every  Federal dollar except for the 10 percent reserved for true emergencies. The act also limits to $3 million the amount an individual school district can receive in any 5-year period. This is done to ensure that all--or at least more--impacted schools will have the opportunity to use these grants to improve the lives of their children. 
   Mr. President, this bill is vital to a vast number of children in Montana, Nebraska, and all across our country. I am hopeful that a comprehensive school construction bill can pass this Congress. But let me tell the Senate today, Senator HAGEL and I plan to make sure that any school construction bill that passes this Senate will also take care of federally impacted school districts. 
   We hope to pass this bill regardless of the larger debate. But if that does not happen, we will also work to include this act in a broader school construction bill. 
   In closing, I want to reiterate that the children who attend schools on Indian lands or military installations are all of our children. We must not ignore them or allow their schools to fall into dangerous disrepair. They deserve the same education as every other child. Let us take this opportunity to redress our negligence in ignoring these children, and show them that we care. Let's pass this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague Senator HATCH in introducing legislation to permanently extend the exception from Subpart F for active financing income earned on overseas business. 
   United States companies doing business abroad are generally allowed to pay U.S. tax on the earnings from the active operations of their foreign subsidiaries when these earnings are returned to the U.S. parent company. Until recently, U.S.-based finance companies such as insurance companies and brokers, banks, securities dealers, and other financial services firms, have not been afforded similar treatment. The current law provision that is intended to afford America's financial services industry parity with other segments of the U.S. economy expires at the end of 1999. Our legislation, intended to keep the U.S. financial services industry on an equal footing with foreign-based competitors, would make this provision permanent. 
   The financial services sector is the fastest growing component of the U.S. trade in services surplus (which is expected to exceed $80 billion this year). It is therefore very important that Congress act to maintain a tax structure that does not hinder the competitive efforts of the U.S. financial services industry. That would be the case if the active financing exception to Subpart F were permitted to expire. 
   The growing interdependence of world financial markets has highlighted the urgent need to rationalize U.S. tax rules that undermine the ability of American financial services industries to compete in the international arena. It is important to ensure that the U.S. tax treatment of worldwide income does not encourage avoidance of U.S. tax through the sheltering of income in foreign tax havens. However, I believe it is possible to adequately protect the federal fisc without jeopardizing the international expansion and competitiveness of U.S.-based financial services companies, including finance and credit entities, commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. 
   This active financing provision is particularly important today. The U.S. financial services industry is second to none, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international marketplace. Through our network of tax treaties, we have made tremendous progress in negotiating new foreign markets for this industry in recent years. Our tax laws should complement, rather than undermine, this trade effort. 
   As is the case with other tax provisions such as the Research and Development tax credit, the temporary nature of the U.S. active financing exception denies U.S. companies the certainty enjoyed by their foreign competitors. U.S. companies need to know the tax consequences of their business operations. Over the last two years, U.S. companies have implemented numerous system changes in order to comply with two very different versions of the active financing law, and are unable to take appropriate strategic action if the tax law is not stable. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and provide a consistent, equitable, and stable international tax regime for the U.S. financial services industry.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment before the Senate, which I do not favor, saddens me. It is not  being straight with the American people. It is packaged in a way to look as if it is protecting Social Security. It is like a lot of products: They are packaged, with a promise on the label which may or may not describe what is inside the package. 
   The package here is called a lockbox to save Social Security. That is the package. That is the wrapping around the product. It is not indicative of the product inside. What is the product inside? Inside the package, the so-called lockbox package, not one penny is added to Social Security. The Social Security trust fund is due to expire in roughly the year 2034. The passage of this amendment does not extend that by one day. There is no difference, no change. 
   What is the product inside this so-called package? What is inside is essentially a provision which will be in the law which says public debt has to decline by the amount that the Congressional Budget Office projects. If at any date it does not, then the debt ceiling is in effect. That means that Government cannot make its payments and meet its obligations as we bump up against the debt ceiling. 
   The amendment before the Senate, the public debt ceiling limit, declines right along with reductions in public debt as projected by the CBO. Why is that a problem? It is a problem because the debt limit is not the way we force fiscal discipline. It is a charade. I have been in the Senate for almost 20 years. I have been part of many debt limit extension debates. They are very embarrassing, very embarrassing. The Government has, through the Congress, through authorization programs, obligations. Of course we have to increase the debt limit or we don't meet our obligations and the creditworthiness is in jeopardy, as in 1975 when Moody put us on a list for possible downgrade. At that point, we were flirting with whether or not to raise the debt limit. 
   Some Senators wanted to add different provisions. It was a political nonargument because we all knew we had to pass the debt. It is a game that is being played here. That is why I stood at the outset to say I am saddened by this amendment. It is not being straight with the American people. 
   Enforce fiscal discipline by spending less, pay-go, or through spending caps we enact and adhere to. That is the main reason the budget deficit declined and now we are reaching surpluses. It is not because of any debt limits. We already have a total debt limit in existence--the public debt plus the debt the Government owes to itself. We have that. This is inside the package, a new debt limit, which is meaningless, totally meaningless, because, obviously, if we meet the debt limit, we have to either raise the debt limit or we do not meet our obligations, which means we cannot spend money we are obligated to spend. 
   Social Security is supposed to be protected, but it is only a priority. If the debt limit is exceeded by such a great amount, it is possible that Social Security beneficiaries will not be receiving their payments. It is a priority above veterans. Veteran benefits could be cut if we pass the debt limit. 
   In addition, the usual debates in the past of whether to extend or raise debt limit ceilings are only majority votes. 
   They are very, very difficult to get even though we all know it has to happen. The amendment before the Senate says it has to be a supermajority, 60 votes. We all know that is practically impossible. 
   The honest approach to saving Social Security and the honest approach to fiscal discipline is to continue the pay-go provisions, extend the caps on discretionary spending. We do our job here because this so-called lockbox, public debt limit provision, is not what it is cracked up to be. The other side is trying to make it look like they are protecting Social Security when, in fact, that is not what they are doing. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join my chairman, Senator CHAFEE, in support of the legislation before us today, S. 507, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. I also want to recognize the new Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senator VOINOVICH, for his hard work on this bill, along with last year's Chairman, Senator WARNER. 
   As we all know, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998 passed this chamber last year, but was never enacted. It is our hope that early action in this session will help us wrap up the unfinished business from the 105th Congress. It will also set us on course to develop a Water Resources Development Act for 2000.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased the House Ways and Means Committee began to act on this issue by passing this bill and the bill passing the full House will come over to the Senate, which we can also then pass. Clearly, our service men and women, particularly those in harm's way, deserve all the support we can possibly give them. The provision we are now discussing which releases them of income tax liability during the time they are serving in a zone of danger, particularly in Kosovo, is the very least we can do. 
   Similarly, the provisions in the bill coming over from the House which provide for all men and women on active duty wherever they may be serving overseas to get the 60-day extension, and also have penalties potentially against them for late filing waived--that, too, is very important. Mr. President, I think it is the very least we can do at this point.  
   In addition to our service men and women, there are also other Americans in harm's way in the war zone, performing above and beyond the call of duty. I am talking about employees of the State Department. I am talking about other groups of people over there, serving, doing their utmost, who are in equally dangerous situations. At some future point I believe they also deserve due recognition in the same way as our military. We support our Americans. We deeply support our fellow Americans serving in the Balkans. I am very pleased the House has acted, and the Senate will be acting very soon. 
   I might say, I am also pleased the House approached this matter in the proper way. That is, they brought it up in the House tax-writing committee, the Ways and Means Committee, where the bill was discussed. It was marked up in the committee and then went to the House floor. That is the preferable way of 
   doing business. 
   In this case, there was an attempt for a bill to be filed at the desk and then brought up directly on the floor on this issue, not going through the Senate tax-writing committee, the Senate Finance Committee. I hope we go back to the usual course of business as a general rule where tax bills go through the Finance Committee before they are brought to the floor. I say that because the legislation will be much better. It will be thought through. There is a chance to correct mistakes. There is a chance to add on measures that should be added on or subtract out measures that should be subtracted out. 
   Having said that, obviously time is of the essence in this case, and the House Ways and Means Committee has acted; that is, the authorizing committee in the other body did act so we did have at least that assurance this has been looked at with some considerable examination. 
   I will be very pleased when the House bill comes over. We will be able to vote on it. That will probably be within the hour. As I said, I hope after we do that we can give also the same kind of thought to other Americans who are also serving in the zone who are also sacrificing to a great degree in serving our country. 
   I yield the remainder of our time.

For that reason, I agree that we should clarify the implications of paragraph (4). In answer to your questions, I would respond that reporting to Congress is meant to say that any reporting will: be in verbal form.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, most people my age have known the heartache of having to watch their parents grow old. It is a sad day in a person's life when they see their father get his first gray hair. Or the day you notice lines in your mother's face where previously, there were none. 
   This aging process is made worse by the scary and very real possibility that too many people who will become senior citizens in the next several years are not at all prepared for the transition from work to retirement. 
   To be honest, it isn't our parents who we need to worry about so much. They survived the Depression. They know what it takes to get by during the lean years--it takes planning and saving. Putting money aside, when it might be easier to spend it in the moment. 
   Those are the values that our parents live by. They are the values we would do well to heed. And even better to teach those who will follow us. 
   We as a nation have lost our imperative to save. Personal savings rates have dropped to one-half of one percent of our Gross Domestic Product, the lowest since 1933. 
   Fifty-one million Americans in our nation's workforce have no pension coverage. But statistics like those don't tell the whole story. They don't do justice to the hardscrabble struggles  that real people go through every day. Struggles that involve agonizing questions like: ``Should I eat today or take my medication?'' or ``Will I be able to heat my house this winter?'' 
   Make no mistake, our nation's lack of saving for retirement is a tragedy in the making. 
   That is why I am so proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation. 
   A bill that will make it easier for Americans to put money aside, and a bill that will help move pension issues to the forefront of Americans' minds. A bill that will: 
   Expand coverage for small businesses because they have a harder time affording health care and retirement plans; 
   Enhance pension fairness for women because they fall into categories that have a harder time saving; 
   Increase the portability of pension plans so that when you change jobs you don't have to worry about where your savings will go; 
   Strengthen pension security and enforcement so you can rest easy at night, knowing your money is safe; 
   Reduce red tape so it's easier for employers to give their workers retirement options; 
   And encourage retirement education so that husbands and wives, parents and children, talk to each other-- make plans for their future. And know what to expect tomorrow and down the road. 
   One aspect of the bill I am particularly proud of are the small business provisions. Thirty-eight million of the people in this country who do not have a pension plan work at small businesses. Eighty percent of all small business employees have no pension coverage. 
   In my state of Montana, more than 95 percent of our businesses are small businesses. And almost 9 out of 10 offer no pension plans. We cannot let these hard-working Americans down. 
   Currently, most small businesses can't afford pension plans. They would like to, but they just can't make ends meet. 
   Our bill makes it a smart business decision for small business owners to offer retirement plans. 
   I have made it my priority to work with members of the small business community, both back in Montana and nationally, to identify legislative solutions that will most readily enable small businesses to offer pension plans to their employees. While this bill does not include every recommendation we received, it does represent a collection of high-priority proposals which we believe could be supported by a bi-partisan majority of Congress. 
   The major provisions in this bill which would help small businesses start and maintain pension plans include the following: 
   To help make pension plans more affordable we have included two new tax credits: one to help defray start-up costs and the other to defray the cost of employer contributions to pension plans; 
   In addition, we provide for the elimination of some fees. 
   To address the problems the small business community has identified as a major impediment to establishing pension plans, we make significant changes in the top-heavy rules that limit employer contributions to plans. 
   To address concerns of our smallest businesses, who want to provide pensions but can only afford `start-up' plans at first, we provide increases in income limits that apply to SIMPLE pension plans, along with a new, salary-reduction SIMPLE plan; 
   And for those employers that want to provide the security of a defined benefit plan for their employees but cannot because of the increased regulatory burden, we create a simplified defined benefit plan for small business. 
   These provisions are designed to address the problems of cost and complexity that are a barrier to so many small businesses. They will help small employers establish a pattern of saving for themselves and their employees. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Pension Coverage and Portability Act will spearhead a national debate on how to improve employer-provided pensions in this country. 
   This debate is essential if we are to achieve our goal of making America in the next century, not only strong as a nation, but strong as a community of individuals confident in the security of their financial futures. 
   This is a good, bi-partisan bill. It takes the positive steps we as a nation need to put our future in safe hands. 
   I am eager for the coming debate on this bill. 
   I hope it sparks a debate in the coffee shops and kitchen tables all across the country. Working together, and with this bill, we can turn a nation of spenders, into a nation of savers.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take just a brief moment to thank my colleagues for passing this resolution marking today as National School Violence Victims Memorial Day. 
   Let me tell you why this day is so important to me and to the citizens of Butte, Montana. 
   Butte fifth grader Jeremy Bullock was 11 years old when he and his twin brother Joshua left for school together as they always did. The day was April 12, 1994. Jeremy didn't come home from school that day. He was shot and killed on the playground, leaving family and a community forever changed. 
   By recognizing March 24th as National School Violence Victims Memorial Day we will be honoring the memory of Jeremy Bullock and countless other children, families and communities by saying clearly, with one voice that we as Americans will meet the challenge of eradicating violence from our schools. 
   So, today and every day, let us always remember Jeremy Bullock. For, though he is gone, his memory will always linger and help to fuel our work.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to follow on the remarks of my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, because I think he, with great articulation, hits the nail on the head. We are talking here not about gimmicks but what is the right way, the most solid way to put a budget together and to protect Social Security. 
   There is a right way; there is a wrong way. The Lautenberg amendment is the right way to preserve Social Security. The amendment of the Senator from Michigan is a good example of an idea that sounds good, but is the wrong way. 
   Mandated reductions in our Nation's debt limit are irresponsible. They are dangerous. They could hurt the very people that the proponents claim they want to help; namely, Social Security beneficiaries. 
   As a member of the Finance Committee, I understand very clearly the risks this amendment poses. Debt is incurred solely to pay expenditures that Congress has already authorized. The time to limit spending is when Congress is considering the underlying bills, whether they be appropriations bills or tax bills, not after the bills have already been enacted into law. By the time the debt limit is reached, the Government is already obligated to make payments and must have enough money to do so.  
   The debt obligations of the United States are recognized as having the least credit risk of any investment in the world. That credit standing is a precious asset for the American people and helps our economy by reducing the costs of borrowing. 
   Remember, the last time we came face to face with a debt limit crisis in November 1995, Moody's credit rating service placed Treasury securities on review for possible downgrade. They did this because it appeared possible for the first time in our Nation's history that the United States might be forced to default on our debt obligations. 
   From the safest investment in the world, America overnight became comparable to that of countries which we do not hold in as high regard. 
   If the debt limit is reached and Congress cannot quickly obtain a supermajority to increase the limit, Treasury might easily be forced to stop honoring any payments. The largest single recurring monthly expenditure for the Treasury comes every month when Social Security checks are sent out. 
   The effect of this amendment, which is being touted as helping to preserve Social Security for the future, could easily be to force current beneficiaries to live without the monthly checks that so many depend upon for their livelihood. Those who support this amendment--that is, of the Senator from Michigan--seem to feel that we must in effect destroy Social Security in order to save it. Obviously, the majority of Members disagree. 
   I believe we can save Social Security for the future without putting current beneficiaries at risk of losing their monthly checks. We can do this not by supporting the Abraham amendment but by sticking to the budget enforcement tools that have successfully brought us this far, from a time of red ink as far as the eye could see to a day of projected budget surpluses. 
   That is why I support strongly the amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG. Simply put, we should reach agreement on a solution to the Social Security problem before we begin spending money we don't yet have. Until that happens, we should keep the pay-go rules and discretionary spending caps in place. This is the only way to truly save Social Security first. 
   I believe if we pursue this course we can make room in the budget for a number of critical priorities. In addition to saving Social Security, we can preserve Medicare. We all know that Medicare is in dire straits, worse shape than Social Security, and I am astounded that the majority party does not want to save Medicare, a program that is in worse shape even than Social Security. 
   I might also say that the balanced budget amendment which we passed a couple of years ago has a disproportionately detrimental effect on rural hospitals and rural doctors. In my State of Montana, rural hospitals lost 6.5 percent in 1997 in spite of the news that hospitals nationwide are making big profits--a 6.5-percent loss. That was before the balanced budget amendment cuts. If, as some suggest, we don't infuse the Medicare trust fund with some surplus moneys, there is a very real possibility that providers could suffer further cuts. If that happens, small rural hospitals will not just lose money, they will close. 
   For all the very real danger in the social security system, did you know that if we do nothing Medicare will be insolvent in about the next ten years? Think about that. 
   We are less than a decade away from allowing a major piece of our nation's security to whither on the vine. 
   Let's consider how quickly that date is coming. Only eight years ago, we launched Operation Desert Storm in Iraq. Ten years ago the Berlin Wall fell. Seems like yesterday, doesn't it? 
   And just a couple of years ago, Mr. President, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. In the BBA, we extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. 
   But we also implemented over $100 billion in cuts to health care providers. I hear about those reductions from Montanans every day. 
   Montana small rural hospitals lost 6.5 percent in 1997, in spite of news that hospitals nationwide were making a killing. 6.5 percent, Mr. President. And that was before the BBA cuts. If, as some have suggested, we don't infuse the Medicare Trust Fund with some surplus monies, there is a very real possibility that providers could suffer further cuts. If that happens small rural hospitals will not just lose money, they will close. 
   And patients--not just providers--will suffer. This Congress should do the responsible thing by not balancing the budget on the backs of Medicare patients and providers. The Senate should dedicate 15 percent of the budget surplus to save Medicare. 
    Mr. President, saving Social Security and shoring up Medicare must be our two top priorities. 
   I don't think that precludes us from passing targeted tax cuts, though. I think we can make room for tax cuts by getting rid of wasteful spending wherever it occurs. 
   Let me tell you a few tax cuts I will personally work for this Congress: 
   We should end the marriage penalty for Montana and American families. 
   We should provide tax cuts to promote education for our children. I will push this year to further expand the student loan interest deduction. I'll introduce legislation to encourage greater donations of computers and technology to schools. And I'll expand the lifelong learning credit so our workers can get the vital training they need to adapt to today's changing, global economy. 
   We should expand pension coverage particularly for our small business. Only one in five Montanans working for small businesses have access to retirement plans. I am introducing legislation to try to make pension plans more affordable and less complicated for small businesses and their employees. 
   And, as part of my safety net to help farmers weather these turbulent times, I am promoting a new farm savings account. 
    Mr. President, in conclusion, I believe that the pending amendment is the right way to go. We must save Social Security first. We should not use gimmicks like the ``lock box'' that could jeopardize our ability to issue social security checks and hurt the very people that we are trying to help. 
    Mr. President, I believe that, without such a gimmick, we can make room in the budget for what should be our three biggest priorities: Social Security, Medicare, and targeted tax cuts. 
   Let's seize this opportunity and do what's right for our country. 
   In summary, I am quite concerned about the priorities that are in the majority budget. A budget sets a country's priorities. For me, one of the main priorities should be saving Social Security, which, in effect, the majority budget does not do. Certainly we should help do what we can to save Medicare, to shore up Medicare, shore up the Medicare trust fund, which certainly the budget resolution before the Senate does not do. 
   We should not use gimmicks like lockboxes, and so forth. It may sound good, but they do not provide the benefits they purport to have. 
   I very much hope we adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, the amendment that sets the priorities that this country really needs and want. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know that each Senator has his own story and experience with respect to problems of veteran health care in his or her home State. I am just going to take a couple of minutes to explain some problems that rural States have with which I am particularly familiar. 
   Today I spoke to Tom Pouliot. Who is Tom? Tom is a vet from my hometown of Helena, MT. He is also the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
   Let me tell you a story that Tom has explained to me, which I know is a major problem in rural States. I say ``rural.'' I mean really rural. I am not talking about eastern rural, although veterans in all parts of the country obviously need health care, and aren't getting the health care that they need. But I am talking about western rural, west of the 100th meridian where it doesn't rain, where the distances between towns are vast. 
   Let me tell you a story I repeat sometimes to my colleagues. 
   When the First Lady was in Montana not too many years ago, she got off the plane, and says, ``This isn't rural. This is mega-rural. This is hyper-rural.'' I mean, for those who haven't been in the West west of the 100th meridian, I don't know, with all due respect, that one gets the sense of just how rural it is until you are there. 
   What is the problem? The problem is that tonight we can vote to increase veterans' health care by an additional $2 billion. That is the amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. JOHNSON. 
   Why do I think that is a good idea? It is a good idea because the VA has had a flatline appropriations for veterans' health care for 3 consecutive years. Just think of it. For 3 consecutive years, there has been no increase for veterans' health care, something that is very important and desperately in need of. I believe that a fourth year of a flatline health care budget would be deeply irresponsible. 
   Let me explain a couple of reasons why. Not only Tom, but I and others who have visited the VA facilities in Montana, of which there are not many, found this problem firsthand. I asked the VA in Montana to visit Miles City, Billings, and Helena, so they could get a firsthand look of what veterans face in getting the health care that they need.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in a nutshell, the problem is this: Veterans in Montana get appointments at Fort Harrison and other veterans facilities. They drive hundreds of miles for the appointments. They get there, and it is canceled. They have to get in their car, or have someone drive them back to their home hundreds of miles away again. This is very common. Why? Because of personnel cuts. It is going to get worse unless we increase the veterans' health care budget. 
   Tonight I plead with my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment. Give our veterans a break. Men and women who have fought so hard for America, particularly our elderly vets, who in, say, World War II, or in the Korean war, fought for America. Here we are increasing the defense budget. We are not helping veterans' health care. That is just not right. 
   All we are asking is to take a little bit of a nick out of the defense budget, just a little, and increase veterans' health care just a little. 
   As I mentioned, there has been no increase in the last 3 years. This budget this year has no increase. That will be the fourth year. Let's just add a little bit to veterans' health care. I think it is the right thing to do for America's veterans. 
   I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the extra minute. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from Alaska. After all, he is one of the two Senators who represent the State of Alaska, and he believes strongly in this matter. 
   Mr. President, this is the very same matter we discussed 6 months ago, exactly the same. This is one of those environmental riders which has popped up again. It is the Glacier Bay environmental rider. That is the environmental rider on the Interior appropriations bill of last year, a bill that never came before the Senate, I think, with all due respect to my good friend from Alaska, because a lot of Senators did not want to have those votes on those environmental riders. There were several of them. And so the whole Interior appropriations bill was then submerged into the omnibus appropriations bill, that giant and super granddaddy bill that came up before the House and Senate last year, and in that omnibus bill there was an agreement--this was a provision which was an agreement essentially between the White House and the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. STEVENS, on this matter. We have already dealt with this. There is an agreement. It was written into the law, and let me read you the agreement. This is the law. The agreement says very simply:  
   The Secretary of Interior and the State of Alaska shall cooperate in the development and the management and planning for the regulation of commercial fisheries in Glacier Bay National Park.  
   On and on. Then it goes on to say:  
   Such management plan shall provide for commercial fishing in the marine waters within Glacier Bay National Park outside of Glacier Bay proper and within marine waters within Glacier Bay as specified in paragraph .....  
   Anybody who wants to can read all of the relevant provisions. Basically, the agreement is this: That fishing, commercial fishing, outside of Glacier Bay is fine. 
   It is fine. Even fishing next to the boundaries of Glacier Bay is fine. A commercial fishery within Glacier Bay was to have certain restrictions because there was a conflict between the national park values within Glacier Bay--for example, wilderness areas within Glacier Bay--and commercial fishing interests within Glacier Bay. 
   So we worked out an agreement--the White House and Senator STEVENS, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee--worked out an agreement, of which I read part. Other parts of the agreement are not quite as relevant as the parts I read. That is the essential nature of the agreement. 
   We have debated this before. This is not new. I stood on this floor several hours, with other Senators, debating other environmental riders. Izembek was an environmental rider; now we have Glacier Bay, another environmental rider. After several hours of debate on the Senate floor, we concluded debate because the Interior appropriations bill never came up. It was withdrawn. It was then subsumed into the large omnibus appropriations bill with the agreement that I just outlined between the White House and the senior Senator from Alaska. 
   Now, here we are all over again; same issue, same subject; nothing new. 
   I say to my colleagues, we have discussed this. We have debated it. We have reached an agreement on this issue. We are here now on the supplemental appropriations bill. We want to get this bill passed today so we can send it over to the other body and have a conference, come back, and be through with the supplemental appropriations this week. 
   Why prolong the Senate on an amendment which has already been debated, an amendment which has already been agreed to, in the sense that a compromise was worked out that recognized both the National Park interests and the wilderness interests--which, after all, are American interests--in Glacier Bay on the one hand, with the fishing interests and particularly the indigenous interests on the other hand? 
   I say to my colleagues, we are hearing this argument all over again. We have an agreement. Essentially, what the amendment by the Senator from Alaska provides is to rescind that agreement. That is what the amendment does, rescind it. It is couched a little bit by saying rescind it and tell the State that it will be rescinded until the State of Alaska has resolved its lawsuit with the Federal Government--but we don't know when that will be; some lawsuits go on forever with appeals and so forth. It is essentially a recision of the agreement that we already agreed to. 
   The State of Alaska and the Department of Interior are now engaging in discussions as to what the management plan at Glacier Bay should be. Those are ongoing discussions. To override the agreement we have reached just because a couple weeks ago we heard that the State of Alaska intends to file a lawsuit--a suit which may or may not occur, a suit which may last for years; who knows if it will ever be finally terminated--and for us to then stop an agreement on that basis, I think, does not make a lot of sense, frankly. 
   I think it makes much more sense--and this is a bit presumptuous on my part--for the State of Alaska to, in good faith, sit down with the Department of Interior and see if they can work out any remaining issues. Certainly filing a lawsuit raises questions as to how feasible an agreement is, whether one can be reached. I say don't file the suit. Sit down with the Department of Interior and try to work it out. If in good faith the State of Alaska believes the Department of Interior is not acting in good faith, then we will see what we can work out at that point. We are not at that point. We are certainly not at that point when a lawsuit has been filed by the State of Alaska which only muddies the waters--no pun intended--on this whole issue. 
   I am not going to go into all the details of this because we have gone over it so many times and in so many hours, except to say this has been debated, this very subject. This is one of those environmental riders which, incredibly, has popped up again. We 
   have reached an agreement; the White House and the senior Senator from Alaska reached an agreement. I say abide by the agreement, try to make that work. If it doesn't work, then we will see if we can resolve it later. 
   We all understand the Senator from Alaska is here standing up for the people at Glacier Bay, and I understand that. However, there is an agreement worked out in the omnibus appropriations bill. I say let's stand by that agreement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I don't know why this issue needs to go on forever. It is deja vu all over again. 
   The Senator from Alaska has admitted that his amendment has the effect of preventing the management plan from going into effect for years--5, 10, who knows how many years--because his amendment essentially says no funds may be expended by the Secretary of Interior to implement the plan until such time as the State of Alaska's legal claim over ownership and jurisdiction, et cetera, is resolved. Who knows how long that is going to take? That could take a long, long time. That would mean for up to many, many years that this issue remains unresolved. 
   We resolved this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. It was resolved. The senior Senator from Alaska agreed with the White 
   House on the compromise, recognizing, on the one hand, the interests of the national park and the wilderness area and, on the other hand, the fishing interests of the people who live in and about Glacier Bay. It has already been agreed to. There is a compromise agreed to by both sides--the Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator, Senator STEVENS, and the White House--in the omnibus appropriations bill. It has been agreed to. 
   So here we are now faced with an amendment which undoes that agreement. It very simply undoes that agreement by saying no funds may be expended with respect to any management plan in Glacier Bay until a lawsuit, not yet filed, is resolved. I say that we should go ahead with the plan. We should go ahead with working out the provisions of the plan. The State of Alaska can still file its lawsuit if it wants to. And that lawsuit may or may not change the result. 
   In addition, I might add, this is a national park. This is a wilderness area. This has very pristine values which all Americans want to protect. We do at the same time want to recognize--and do recognize--the interests of the fishermen in Glacier Bay; thus, the compromise. The compromise, the agreement, is already reached. It has been debated ad nauseam. So I am going to stop right here. 
   I urge the Senate to uphold the original agreement, which most Senators already agreed to when they voted for the omnibus appropriations bill last year.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, and my other colleagues to introduce this bill, which is so critical to the ability of American businesses to effectively compete in the global marketplace. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes as original co-sponsors one-third of the members of this body. This bill is bi-partisan and bi-cameral. Companion legislation, introduced in the House by Representatives NANCY JOHNSON and ROBERT MATSUI, is co-sponsored by over one-quarter of the Members of the House. 
   Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological innovation, a position that would not be possible absent U.S. companies' commitment to research and development. Investment in research is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is appropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs involved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the tax code for research expenses provides a modest but crucial incentive for companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs for U.S. workers. 
   The R&D credit has played a key role in placing the United States ahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. Every dollar that the federal government spends on the R&D credit is matched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by private companies, and $2 of spending over the long run. Our global competitors are well aware of the importance of providing incentives for research, and many provide more generous tax treatment for research and experimentation expenses than does the United States. As a result, while spending on non-defense R&D in the United States as a percentage of GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's and Germany's has grown. 
   The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been limited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. In addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to lapse only to be extended retroactively, the 1996 extension left a 12-month gap during which the credit was not available. This unprecedented lapse sent a troubling signal to  the U.S. companies and universities that have come to rely on the government's longstanding commitment to the credit. 
   Much research and development takes years to mature. The more uncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its potential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating research projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the credit, they are less likely to invest in research in this country, less likely to put money into cutting-edge technological innovation that is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition. 
   Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying technological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in creating educationally advanced workforces and join the U.S. as high-technologically manufacturing centers, they become more attractive to companies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational companies sometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic research activities overseas is necessary if they are to remain competitive. The uncertainty of the R&D credit factors into their economic calculations, and makes keeping these jobs in the U.S. more difficult. 
   According to a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand last year, making the R&D credit permanent will provide a substantial positive stimulus to investment, wage-growth, productivity, and overall economic activity for this country. Payroll increases from gains in productivity are estimated to total $64 billion over the period 1998 through 2010. In the year 2010 alone, the payroll increase is estimated to total nearly $12 billion. 
   Also according to the study, gross State Product, which is the basic measure of economic activity in a state, will rise overall by nearly $58 billion between 1998 and 2010 as a result of a permanent credit. Nearly three-fifths of this increase nationally is attributable to additional value added by industries that generally do not perform R&D themselves, but benefit from the R&D done by companies in other industries. 
   Gains in payroll and in Gross State Produce are not limited to states regarded as centers for technological innovation. Although such regions of the country certainly benefit from the credit, each and every state will profit in some measurable way from the credit since all sectors of the economy--agriculture, mining, basic manufacturing, and high-tech services--benefit from productivity improvements resulting from the additional research and development caused by the credit. 
   My own State of Montana is an excellent example of this economic activity. The total increase in payroll due to the R&D credit for the years 1998-2010 is estimated to be just over $250 million. The total increase in Gross State Product during this same period is expected to be $150 million. Neither of these increases place Montana in the top tier of States benefiting from the credit. However, looking beyond those numbers, the impact of the credit in Montana is substantial. In 1995, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were employed directly by high-tech firms in Montana. Almost 400 establishments provided high-technology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs paid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in 1995 of $19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance of the R&D credit. And many more jobs in Montana are dependent upon the growth and stability of the high-tech sector. Although the cumulative numbers may not be high in comparison with other States, the impact of the R&D credit on Montana's economy is clear. 
   Senator HATCH and I are not newcomers to this issue. We have jointly introduced bills to make the R&D credit permanent in numerous previous Congresses only to end up with extensions of one year or less. But I like to think that this year will be different. The hard work we have done to bring our budget into balance is finally beginning to pay off, and the projected budget surpluses gives us an opportunity to think carefully about how best to allocate our resources. We believe making the R&D credit permanent is a wise use of budget dollars because of the direct positive impact on economic growth and productivity. This is not just a corporate issue. This is a use of tax dollars that benefits all of us who are working to expand employment, increase wages and keep our Nation at the cutting edge of technological development. I sincerely hope we can make this year the year that the R&D credit becomes a permanent part of our tax code. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas raises obviously a very important question, and that is, essentially, the terms under which the  United States should agree to help encourage China to be a member or accede to the WTO. It is obviously important because China, particularly in the next century, is going to be a very important country. It is now the largest country in the world, the most populous, the largest standing army, a nuclear power, one of the fastest growing ``developing countries,'' thousands of years of history, a very proud people. We in the United States clearly must be very careful and clear headed in our relationship with such a country, particularly when the question arises as to the terms under which China would accede to the WTO. 
   It is also true that under the Constitution, the U.S. Congress provides that the Congress essentially set trade policy. That is true. But the use of power is a very important matter. Sometimes it is important to use power that is entrusted to one. Sometimes it is important to forebear the use of power that is entrusted to one. 
   Certainly, Congress has the authority to pass the amendment suggested by the Senator from Arkansas. But that is not the question. The real question is, Should Congress adopt that amendment? 
   In my judgment, it has the ring of simplicity which often sounds good, but when one thinks about it a little bit more deeply and what the consequences of that amendment would be, it, at the very least, causes people to pause and, in my judgment, causes Senators to not support the amendment. 
   I am reminded of a statement by H.L. Mencken, a famous Baltimore Sun journalist: ``For every complicated problem, there is a simple solution, but it is usually wrong.'' 
   That is this case. There is a complicated problem--China and our trade relationship--and the simple solution to some degree is, ``Congress should vote on whether to admit China to the WTO or not.'' 
   This would set new precedent, a groundbreaking and very alarming precedent. In each of the previous 110 cases where countries have acceded to the GATT, or to the WTO, there has not been a congressional vote. Congress has never voted on whether a country should accede to the GATT, currently to the WTO. That is an executive decision. 
   There is a good reason why Congress has not voted in the past. Essentially, it is for the reasons suggested already by the Senator from Arkansas, because if we were to vote on whether China should accede to the WTO, that vote would essentially be a vote not on WTO, but it would be a vote on our ``overall China policy.'' It would include countless other relationships that we have with China. 
   The Senator from Arkansas already mentioned them. Human rights, for example. The Senator is very upset with China's human rights policy. He said that should be looked into. He implied looking into it in the context of this debate. 
   I, too, am upset with China's human rights policy. I daresay every Member of the Senate is upset with China's human rights policy. But are those issues considered in trade negotiations? Are they considered by the World Trade Organization? The Senator from Arkansas might think that they should be, but they are not considered in trade negotiations and in whether or not China is or is not meeting commercially acceptable principles under which it would properly be admitted to the World Trade Organization. 
   The Senator also mentioned the words ``political environment.'' He said this issue has to be considered in the total political environment of our relationship with China. He mentioned espionage. That is a charged issue right now. I daresay that if the Congress were to vote in the next several months presumably on whether China should accede to the WTO, there would be an amendment on espionage, there would be an amendment on human rights, an amendment on labor relations, an amendment on the environment. I can think of countless subjects that would be included, by the design of certain Senators, in any decision by the Congress whether or not China should be admitted to the WTO. 
   It reminds me very, very much of the debate we already had with respect to China, and that is whether the Congress, when we come up with the annual MFN review--actually a lot of us like to call it normal trade relationship not most-favored-nation status. MFN is a gross misnomer. MFN is not at all what it implies. It is not most favored. In effect, 
   it is least favored, because we have so many trade agreements with so many other countries under terms that are more beneficial than the bottom line terms of MFN. 
   During the MFN debate, or normal trade relations debate, we have had in this Congress, particularly several years ago, the question was whether we should pass in this Congress every June a conditional extension of MFN or nonconditional extension of MFN. 
   Those who argued for conditional extension said, ``Well, we will continue MFN with China for another year if China abides by certain human right regimes, if China abides by certain nuclear technology transfer provisions, if China signs a comprehensive missile test ban treaty, if China''--all these other things. 
   In a sense, that debate became a debate about China and gave interest groups an opportunity--I use this term loosely--to kind of take off on or vent their spleens about a certain policy with which that Senator or interest group had a disagreement. 
   I have no problem with that. In fact, I support it. I support Members of the Senate and the House working vigorously to improve upon the relationship with China in each of the specific areas that we engage China, and there are many of them. Trade is one. Even within trade, there are many, many different levels. There are tariffs. There are distribution systems. There is access. There are all kinds of matters with which we have to deal. 
   Let's take national security, not very related to trade--indirectly but not directly. Our administration, other countries' administrations engage China on a host of national security issues. 
   Let's take the Taiwan Straits, for example. That is a separate matter. It is an extremely important issue. It is one that has become a bit sensitive in the last several days, but the U.S. Defense Department, the NSC, and our executive branch are working out with Taiwan, with China, and with Japan as much as possible the various interrelationships of that issue. 
   The main point is, those issues should be dealt with separately and on separate tracks. They should not be all subsumed in the one vote on whether China should be a member of the WTO. 
   I think it is also important to remember we have a lot of problems with China, but China has done a lot of good things, too. 
   What are they? Recently in the economic sphere, China, at great cost to itself, has not devalued its currency. China, in the last year, has been under tremendous pressure to devalue its currency so that it could sell more products overseas; it would help boost its economy. But China has not. 
   Why has China not devalued its currency? In many respects because the Americans have encouraged them, have asked them not to devalue. Why? Because if they were to devalue their currency, then the other southeastern countries--the baht in Thailand, the Indonesian currencies, North Korea--there would be great pressure on them to devalue further, which means that our exports will be that much more expensive, their exports to the United States that much less expensive, and the trade deficit we are all so worried about will be even worse. 
   China, at great cost to itself, has so far--that might change--not devalued the currency. 
   China has also signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. They signed it. That is a major step. That is good. China has helped provide more stability between India and Pakistan, particularly when those countries were starting to test missiles. It has been a very great help to us. 
   They also have begun to downsize their state-owned enterprises. That is not something we asked them to do, but at great cost to themselves, they are doing so, and that is a major effort. 
   There is banking reform. 
   The PLA, their army in China, which used to be a major competitor with companies in the United States, was not just an army, it was a manufacturing firm, an industry or a company making all kinds of products. 
   The PLA are going out of business. It is not entirely done yet, but they are going out of business. That is good. Even more fundamentally, let's think of this. What if this were 25 years ago and we were faced with the Asian currency turmoil, which did spread over to Brazil and over to Russia and has affected the whole world, as a matter of fact? If this were to have happened 25 years ago, I daresay that China would have used it as an opportunity to further destabilize--they could have used it as an opportunity to gain a strategic position in, say, Vietnam or in Burma, Thailand, maybe even in Japan, as they did 25 years ago when they exercised their power, but not in the economic sense. 
   Instead, today, 25 years later, when presented with this crisis, what has China done? It has not been a bad boy; it has been a good boy. China has, instead, downsized its state-owned enterprises as much as it possibly can. It is reducing its bureaucracy, cutting a lot of the dead wood. It is cutting back on the army dramatically. I was in China about a year ago talking with a general and all his colleagues who were being given the boot because the general officers corps, in addition to the lower ranks, was being cut back dramatically. 
   They are going through a lot of painful times. I am not going to stand here and apologize for China. We are very concerned about China. But instead, China is trying to be a player. 
   Why is WTO good for America and why is it good for China? WTO is good for America only under commercially acceptable principles. I must underline that forcefully. It is good for America because it will help encourage a greater rule of law in China, because there are commitments that China would have to agree to. It would help America because we could take China to the WTO. 
   The Senator from Arkansas has a concern whether we could ``trust'' China. I tell you, Mr. President, China will do more of what we wish if they are a member of WTO, at least on trade issues, because we can take China to the WTO. 
   The WTO is now much more impartial and more effective as a dispute settlement mechanism than it was under the old GATT, to be honest about it. The WTO as an institution is being tested now, particularly with respect to bananas and beef hormones, and some other issues--whether countries live up to it--but still it is a lot better than the old GATT, under which there was virtually no dispute settlement mechanism. 
   WTO is good for China, too. Why? Basically because it gives China status and more investment in China; it gives China the opportunity to be more of a player in the world economic scene. And that is all good. That is good for China; that is good for America. 
   We are so interrelated today economically, politically, socially that when one part of the world's economy collapses or goes south, it has effects everywhere. It affects the Senator's farmers. They have a harder time selling soybeans. It affects farmers in my State. They have a harder time selling wheat. That is why, when the Asian currency crisis occurred, at least in my State, our agricultural exports fell $50 million compared to the preceding year. 
   I must say, I think we have done a pretty good job as a country in managing, as near as we could, the currency crisis, which we did not cause. It was caused by a whole host of 
   factors--essentially greed by a lot of creditors who did not look at financial statements closely anymore. But we have done a pretty good job managing. Secretary Rubin, Chairman Greenspan, Secretary Summers have done a good job of helping stabilize, as much as they possibly could, this turmoil. 
   Mr. President, the Senator also asked, ``Well, gee, who should be admitted first, Taiwan or China?'' That is a political issue. We should not look at this as a political issue. We should look at these countries on their merits. And if China does meet the commercially acceptable principles test closely, tightly, we should admit China. If they do not, we should not. 
   There are lots of different areas there that I wish to just briefly mention as to the test I think China should meet. I must say, Mr. President, I do not think this administration is going to send us a weak agreement. It would be foolish for them to agree to China's accession into the WTO under noncommercially acceptable terms. It would not make any sense. For one thing, it would be an outrage. Second, it would have an effect on MFN, a vote later. It would have an effect on fast-track proposals that may or may not come up. It just does not make sense. They will not do it. 
   One final point is this. The Senator wants a vote. The Senator is going to have a vote. It is on MFN extension, because, by definition, if the United States agrees, because China has met commercially acceptable principles, that China should accede to the GATT, then by definition this Congress must vote on whether to give China permanent MFN status. 
   There will be a vote. And obviously, if the U.S. Senate believes that the terms under which China is admitted are not acceptable, I daresay that this body will not agree to permanently extend MFN to China. So we ought to have a vote. The Senator wants a vote. By definition, there will be a vote. 
   But to have a second vote--and the second vote would be whether to admit--I say, would essentially be a referendum on China. It would not just be trade issues, it would be all the other issues, with all the other amendments that would come up, just as they did in the old MFN extension debate. Back then, after lots of gnashing of teeth and working ourselves through all this, what did the Congress do? The Congress agreed, the President agreed, that it made more sense to have unconditional extension of MFN rather than conditional. 
   What the Senator from Arkansas is essentially saying is, he wants conditional, he wants to have a vote on accession. And I would guess he also would like to have an opportunity to offer amendments on the pending bill. If the Senator says no amendments on the pending bill, that is another matter. I would like to hear the Senator's views on that--whether the Senator wants a straight up-or-down vote only on whether China should be a member of the WTO, whether he would oppose all amendments, whether he believes, frankly, there should be no amendments or not. That would be an interesting question. 
   Anyway, Mr. President, I made my main point, which is, let's have the vote, let's have the vote on MFN extension, not on the overall policy, because it has never happened before. In all the trade agreements that have been submitted to the WTO and in all the questions of accession to the WTO in the past--there have been 110 of them--never has a Congress voted, never. 
   And there are reasons. There are executive agreements. If we were to vote on it, particularly in this body, as a nonparliamentary form of government, it would be filled up with all different types of issues which are virtually unrelated to trade--very important issues: Human rights, national security, missile proliferation, nuclear proliferation, labor laws, environmental laws, but not WTO accession. 
   So I say, let's not vote for the Senator's amendment. Let's look at WTO when it comes up in the context of MFN. Then let's also work to engage China on all of the other issues on which we are dealing with China but on separate tracks, separate ways, because that is going to be a lot more effective. We should not link all this together. We should not link it together, but, rather, deal with these issues separately. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BAUCUS. I will take just 2 or 3 minutes before I yield back my time. We are getting into the repetitious stage. 
   Let me say that it is important to think about the precedent. Congress has never voted on this issue before. There are a lot of other countries that are going to be seeking membership in the WTO. They are basically former Soviet Union republics. Russia--name them. They all are going to be looking for membership in the WTO. If we start voting now on membership, I think we have to do the same for all the others, and they will get caught up in the other issues, too, that have already been discussed. 
   Frankly, the Senator from Arkansas made my case when he said that at this time we have the greatest leverage. It sounds to me as if the leverage he is talking about is on human rights. It is on lots of issues. I just think that we do not want to get to a debate on China policy if and when the U.S. executive branch seeks to have China become a member of the WTO. 
   I also suggest to my good friend from Arkansas it is a good opportunity for the Senator and all of us who are concerned about the terms of China's infamous WTO, the economic terms, to make our case very strenuously now with the administration, with Ambassador Barshefsky, with others in the administration, so that they do come  up with terms that we would more likely agree with than not. 
   Now is the time. There are intense negotiations going on now. Premier Zhu Rongji is about to visit this country. I think it is Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States which gives us ``leverage,'' because he will want to come with an agreement. We should make use of that leverage by vigorously talking with the administration. 
   It has been a good debate and I think we should deal with all these issues of China separately, not in the context of WTO. I hope that the Senators would agree with the Senator from Alaska when he moves to table the amendment.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator GRASSLEY in introducing the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of 1999. 
   The American farm is the cornerstone of our rich cultural heritage. Yet farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. A family farmer's income depends on good weather and strong international markets. When either of these two factors turn negative, farmers have few tools at their disposal to cushion the blow. 
   Farm families are now suffering record low prices on grain and livestock in the most severe farming crisis since the 1980's. Who could have imagined back in 1996 when Congress passed the Freedom to Farm Act that wheat prices would drop from $4.50 a bushel to $2.81 a bushel by September 1998? As wheat and other agricultural commodity prices dipped to record lows, America's producers have been stranded without a safety net, causing a severe financial crisis. 
   I sincerely hope that 1999 will be the ``Year of Recovery'' for our battered farm economy. I believe we can make this happen by focusing on three goals: 
   We must pry open foreign markets to agricultural products. 
   We must help agricultural producers at home. 
   We must install a permanent safety net to help producers weather times of crisis. 
   In two other bills I have introduced, I have proposed changes to the crop insurance program in order to help re-build this safety net for farmers. Today's introduction of the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act is another step in this re-building process. The FARRM Act is a pro-active measure that would give farmers a five-year window to manage their money. It allows them to put aside up to 20% of their annual income for up to 5 years in a tax-deferred FARRM account. They only pay taxes on the amount set-aside when it is withdrawn from the account. 
   The FARRM bill allows the farmer to help himself. It allows farmers to manage their incomes, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets. It is not a new subsidy, nor is it a new government program. It is simply a new tool farmers can use to cope with an uncertain world. It provides American farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times with an opportunity to enjoy their success during the good times. 
   I believe the FARRM Act is an essential strand in the safety net we must weave to protect our nation's farm families. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator ROTH, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and fellow Montanan, in introducing this important bill. Mr. President, I have agreed to join Chairman ROTH in introducing this bill for one reason--I believe we must increase the level of personal savings in our country. 
   Personal savings have been on a precipitous decline during the last 2 decades. Net personal savings have dropped from 9.3% of Gross Domestic Product in the 1970's to one-half of one percent in 1999. This is the lowest rate of personal savings since 1933. If we are to reverse this decline, and help Americans plan for their retirement years, we must create a culture of savings in our country. 
   The Retirement Savings Opportunity Act is one piece of a much broader effort to reverse this trend. Another important part of this puzzle is represented by the package of regulatory reforms I have been working on with Senators GRAHAM and GRASSLEY, in a bill that will be introduced shortly. Yet another approach is represented by the President's proposal to create Universal Savings Accounts for all working Americans. I support the President's commitment to dedicate a portion of our projected budget surpluses to helping Americans save for their retirement, though I am modifying his proposal to take advantage of our existing pension system and enhance it. All of these proposals, when taken together in a comprehensive package, will help Americans of all income levels save for the future. 
   My particular concern is in pension coverage for small businesses and their employees. Less than one in every five Americans working for small businesses have access to pension plans through their workplace. This represents 40 million working Americans who do not have pension coverage. And since virtually all of the net new jobs being created in this country are being created by small businesses, their retirement security must not be neglected. We simply must make it easier for small businesses to start pension plans, and to provide pension coverage to their employees. 
   I am particularly pleased with the small business incentives included in the Retirement Savings Opportunity Act. This bill contains a tax credit to help defray the administrative costs small businesses incur when they start up new pension plans. It also includes an additional tax credit as an incentive for small business owners who contribute money on behalf of their employees into new plans. Finally, the bill includes a new, simplified defined benefit plan for small businesses. These are not by any means the only ways we can help small businesses provide pensions for their workers, but they are a good start down that road. The increased limits that are included in the bill will also help this process by making it easier for employers to save, thus making it more likely they will also provide benefits to their lower paid workers. 
   I am very excited that we are finally engaging in a public policy debate about retirement security. Only by elevating this debate to the highest levels will we be able to make the changes necessary to truly make the American dream a reality for everyone. We must help Americans make their Golden Years truly golden, so they can look forward to a secure financial future. This bill, as part of a comprehensive solution that includes other proposals directed toward lower-income workers, will help make retirement security a reality for all Americans.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator BURNS, to introduce the ``Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System Act of 1999.'' This bill, which is broadly supported, will ensure the Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation, as well as the surrounding communities in my great state of Montana, something that each and everyone one of us in this body take for granted everyday--a safe and reliable water supply. 
   This legislation authorizes a municipal, rural and industrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation and the surrounding communities off the Reservation who compose the Dry Prairie Water Association. Using a small amount of water from the Missouri River, this project will benefit the entire region of Northeast Montana. This legislation has the support of the State of Montana, the residents of the Fort Peck Reservation, the Tribal Council of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, and all of the towns and communities surrounding the Reservation. 
   I am proud to sponsor this legislation because it represents the coming together of people who have traditionally been divided on many issues. The need for water has surfaced a tremendous show of friendship and trust in Northeast Montana. This project has given the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes and the off-Reservation public common ground to work towards and provided the trust needed for rural communities to grow and prosper. The need for water exists not only for drinking, but also for agricultural, municipal, and industrial purposes. 
   Together, the people in this region are plagued with major drinking water problems. The Reservation and surrounding communities are clearly in desperate need of a safe and good source of drinking water. In one community, the sulfate levels in the water are four times the standard for safe drinking water. In four of the communities, iron levels are five times the standard. Sadly, some residents have been forced to abandon their homes and their farms because their only source of water has been polluted with brine from oil production. 
   In all of the communities throughout the Reservation, groundwater exceeds the standards for total dissolved solids, iron, sulfates, and nitrates. In some instances, more lethal minerals such as selenium, manganese, and fluorine are found in high concentrations. 
   In the area north of Culbertson, nitrate levels are too high to safely use ground water. Along the Eastern borders, from Froid to Plentywood, the high manganese, iron and total dissolved solids, make treating the water very expensive. In the Northeast, near Westby, there is oil field contamination from seismographing and salt water injection methods. 
   In the middle of the service area, near Flaxville, nitrates and sulfates exceed safe drinking water standards also. Finally, in the west, in the St. Marie area, ground water is so hard and in such short supply that it is unusable. In addition, several local water  systems have had occurrences of biological contamination. 
   As a result of the poor water that exists here, the Indian Health Service has issued several public health alerts. In most communities in this region, residents are forced to buy bottled water at a cost of at least $75 a month. Those who cannot afford to buy bottled water--of whom there are many--must continue to use the existing water sources, at great risk to their health. Yet, despite the above mentioned health risks, an ideal source of safe water, the Missouri River, flows past these people every day. 
   In addition to the need for safe drinking water, an adequate source of water is needed to preserve and protect agricultural operations. As you know Mr. President, Northeast Montana relies almost exclusively on agriculture to survive. The changing agricultural industry has brought high unemployment and low family income to this area. To compete in these challenging times, most agriculture producers in rural America are adding value to the products they grow. To add value however, you must have processing facilities that allow you to manufacture a high quality, finished product. The people of Northeast Montana do not have the quality of water needed to support industry of this kind. The region's ability to supply employment and compete in agriculture is destroyed without essential infrastructure. 
   I have described a desperate and complex situation, Mr. President. The solution however, is simple. We need to provide a water system that will deliver a safe and good source of water to the residents of the Region. Fortunately, most of the work has been done. By working together on a local and state level, these groups have struck a deal that provides an adequate source of water for all who need it, for this generation of users and for future generations. By using a small amount of water from the Missouri River, combined with the structure this bill provides, residents of Northeast Montana will be able to enjoy the same, safe water supply that you and I do. 
   I look forward to swift passage of this legislation.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction of the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999. Senator CRAIG and I are introducing this bill today to provide a safety net to our agricultural producers and make rural America stronger than ever. 
   I especially would like to thank Senator CRAIG's staff, Wayne Hammon, who has worked diligently with my staff in bringing together this bipartisan effort for agriculture. I also compliment my colleagues Senators KERRY and ROBERTS who have introduced crop insurance reform legislation, of which I am also a cosponsor, for setting the stage for a major overhaul of the crop insurance program. This bill, the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999 is designed to compliment their efforts by extending the safety net to help those producers of speciality or alternative crops who find particular challenges in the present system. 
   Now more than ever this crop insurance reform legislation is needed for my state's leading industry. 
   Mr. President, agriculture is Montana's leading industry. More than 100,000 Montanans work in farm and ranch related jobs. That is nearly 20 percent of our state's total employment. In 1998, Montana agriculture generated $2.4 billion--65 percent of our state's total economy. In Montana, agriculture is not only an integral part of our economy, it's a way of life. And that way of life is in peril. 
   In 1998, Montana producers were hit hard as our ag exports dropped by $570 million, and commodities such as wheat and beef plummeted to Depression-era prices. 
   In response to this severe economic hit, we fought hard in the 105th Congress to install a safety net where the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill fell short. With help from the White House, we were able to get almost $8 billion in emergency assistance for our producers in Montana and across the country. We responded to the crisis but there's no assurance that we won't be faced with the same problems each year. 
   This bill is aimed at getting Montana producers back on their feet. We do that by focusing on, and fighting for agriculture, together. I sincerely hope that 1999 will be the ``Year of Recovery.'' And I believe we can do this by maintaining focus on three goals: 
   We must pry open foreign markets to Montana products. 
   We must help agriculture producers at home. 
   We must install a permanent safety net to help producers weather times of crisis. 
   By aggressively pursuing these three goals, I am confident that we can help Montana agriculture not only recover, but be stronger than ever before. 
   Today, however, I would like to focus on the goal of installing a safety net to help producers during times of crisis. 
   Mr. President, no matter how well we are doing nationally and internationally, we must be prepared for hard times. In 1996, Congress passed the Freedom to Farm Act. Since then, wheat prices have fallen 55 percent. Who could have predicted that prices would plunge from $4.50 a bushel for wheat in 1996 to $2.91 a bushel by September 1998? This drop, triggered by a combination of natural disasters and oversupply in the marketplace, was impossible to predict. 
   As wheat and other agricultural commodity prices dipped to record lows, America's producers were suddenly stranded without a safety net, causing a severe financial crisis. This made it clear to me that we need a contingency plan to help us when hard times come so that we can continue to grow when times are good. 
   In February I hosted a crop insurance field hearing in Shelby, Montana. Ken Ackerman, Director of the Risk Management Agency traveled from Washington, D.C. to meet with Montana producers to hear first hand their concerns about crop insurance. At that hearing some of Montana's outstanding producers shared their stories, their frustrations and their ideas about reforming the system. I would like to thank Rick Sampsen, Bill Brewer, Verg Aageson, Brian Schweitzer, Nancy Peterson, Rollie Schlepp, Scott Kulbeck and Mary Schuler for taking the time to lend their voices to this important discussion. Their ideas are reflected in this legislation today which will:

   Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Vermont, for yielding time.  
   Mr. President, I am very strongly in favor of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. That is very simply because if there is any investment that makes sense in this country, it is investing in education, pure and simple, full stop, end of subject. 
   At all levels--whether it is Head Start, whether it is the early years zero to 3, whether it is after Head Start, 
   whether it is kindergarten, whether it is elementary and secondary, whether it is college, whether it is postgraduate education, whether it is continuing education, whether it is technical skills development--education is the investment which is going to make the difference in our country and assure our future as Americans, the time we spend continuing to educate our people in a very thoughtful, constructive way. Of course, we do not want to just throw money at the problem but, rather, we want to invest wisely; and this legislation, S. 280, is very much, in my judgment, a step in that direction. 
   Let me address Ed-Flex, that is, the basic underlying bill, and tell you why I am so proud to be a cosponsor of the bill and why I think it is important legislation. 
   The name of the bill basically explains it--Ed-Flex. It is flexibility for educational programs, and particularly at home. It is very simple. The Federal Government, I believe, ought to trust parents, trust teachers, and trust local school boards. We should do everything in our power here in Washington to liberate our children from Federal Government rules that might make sense in Manhattan, NY, but perhaps do not make sense in Manhattan, MT. 
   I was a little surprised at the previous speaker, my good friend from Georgia, saying an amendment on this bill is Washington wizard wonk stuff telling local governments what to do. That is just not true. This is Ed-Flex. It is giving more flexibility to local communities to decide more on their own what makes most sense. For example, let's talk a little bit about computers. Right now, for example, a well meaning but distant Federal bureaucracy does too often stand in the way of a school district. 
   For example, let's talk about Federal funds allowed to a small Montana school, or even a large New York City school, to purchase computers for students with disabilities. We know those computers probably will not be used all day long, that is, computers, mandated by Washington, for students with disabilities. It obviously makes sense that these computers should be utilized to help other students when the disabled students do not need them. But there is a rule, a Washington rule, that prevents this from happening, preventing other students from using those computers. 
   That is the point of this bill, more flexibility. Under Ed-Flex, the underlying bill, States can get a waiver to use these computers to educate our kids. In short, the bill makes eminent sense. It is the next logical step to help our kids be better educated. 
   Let me address an amendment that has been under discussion, the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, and the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, an amendment to lower class size in our country. 
   This is pretty basic stuff. There aren't many things we can do to help students more than lowering class size. I hear some Senators in the Chamber say the opposite; they at least are very strongly implying that lower class size does not help kids, does not help the quality of education. 
   If we just think about it intuitively, Mr. President, that just doesn't make sense. But what is the evidence? One Senator recently mentioned Minnesota, a State that ranked third in recent national test scores but apparently, according to the Senator, has high average class sizes. 
   I cannot speak about Minnesota, but I can speak about my State of Montana. Our teacher-to-student ratio is much lower than the national average, but we are very proud of the quality of education in our State. Montana's fourth graders and eighth graders placed among the top four States in three of the four categories, again, with class sizes that are lower than average. I can tell you from at least my experience years ago going to Montana schools that we had smaller classes, and it made a big difference. I have very vivid memories of very good teachers in classes that were not too large. 
   I also want to relate an experience that is not directly relevant to this discussion, but I think it does have some bearing on the basic underlying point. 
   Mr. President, like a good number of other Senators, I have what I call a ``workday.'' About 1 day a month I work at some different job. I might wait tables, work at a sawmill, work in a mine. I show up at 8 in the morning with my sack lunch and I am there to work. I am not there to watch, I am there to work. My good friend, Senator GRAHAM from Florida, has been doing this for many, many years. Frankly, I got the idea from him about 6, 8, or 10 years ago. It is a great idea and it is one of the best parts about this job, frankly--to be able to do things like that. 
   One day on my workday in Helena, MT, I was assigned to a health care center. In the morning I helped an Alzheimer's patient. This patient was obviously in great need of care and I learned a lot, I must say, about the problem of Alzheimer's disease--both for the person who has it and with respect to the care giver. 
   But in the noon hour, for 2 hours the center assigned me to the Meals on Wheels Program. They gave me a little van loaded up with hot lunches and a list of names and told me which part of town to go to, to drive around and deliver these meals. This is the basic hot lunch program. About the second or third name on the list was a name that seemed familiar. It rang a bell; I wasn't sure what. It was Mrs. Foote. 
   I asked myself: Why is that familiar, that name, Mrs. Foote? I didn't think a lot about it. I knocked on the door and the lady said come in. She opened up the door, and way back in this hot little kitchen, sitting at the kitchen table, was a lady. Then it dawned on me. 
   I said, ``Mrs. Foote, by any chance did you ever teach kindergarten?'' 
   She said, ``Why, yes, I did.'' 
   I said, ``Did you teach kindergarten in the basement of the First Christian Church, at the corner of Power Street and Benton Street?'' 
   ``Why, yes, I did.'' 
   That was my kindergarten teacher, whom I had not seen since kindergarten. 
   Why did I have such a strong memory of Mrs. Foote? One, I do vaguely recall, I must say we didn't have a large class. I must be honest and say I don't remember much about that. I do remember Mrs. Foote being a super teacher. She didn't remember me from Adam, as I must confess, but as I was talking to Mrs. Foote she then pulled out some newspaper articles about her. 
   I then realized why in many respects Mrs. Foote meant so much to me. Mrs. Foote had a master's degree in art history, she had a master's degree in English literature, yet she was teaching kindergarten. She was one of these wonderful Americans who was sacrificing her time to be a teacher, a high-quality teacher, and also a teacher, as I recall, who did not have an awful lot of kids in her class. 
   Not too long ago, in fact about a half-hour ago, I heard a Senator here on the floor saying, ``Gee, you give me a choice between a high-quality teacher and a large class size and I'll make the choice every time for the quality teacher.'' Obviously, that is a false choice. That is not what we are talking about here. We want high-quality teachers. But we also want small class sizes, because smaller classes--all things being equal--do help provide a better education. 
   This amendment, the Murray-Kennedy amendment, is an additional sum of money for teachers. We in Montana will get 
   about $4 to $5 million. In addition, the amendment has a 15-percent provision, which is that 15 percent of the funds can be used to train teachers. It gives that additional flexibility. 
   I must say, this is a no-brainer, to me. I just don't know why school districts and teachers and parents would not like to have a little extra help, some extra help to hire a few more teachers, a little extra help to train a few more teachers. That is all this is. This is not rearranging the categories, the boxes. This is not taking money from one program to give to another. This is an add-on. This is additional.  
   So I hope some of the viewers and listeners--who earlier heard other Senators speak--realize this is not Washington telling State and local district school boards what to do. Rather, it is saying: Here is some additional money for some teachers, for some training, because we want to help you. We want to form a partnership with you to make sure our kids get the best quality education they could possibly get. That is all it is. It is that simple. 
   I strongly urge when we do vote on this tomorrow that the amendment pass. I know the bill is going to pass. It is a very important step we will be taking to help invest in our Nation's future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Post Office Community Partnership Act of 1999. 
   There has been a great deal of debate lately on the importance of letting states and localities make their own decisions. Whether it is with highway funding, the the ``ed flex'' bill, or legislation to allow states more latitude in establishing rural hospitals, there is increasing sentiment that Washington really doesn't know better--states and localities should find solutions to the problems they know best. It is in the spirit of state and local control that I, along with Senator JEFFORDS, introduce legislation to give citizens a say in Postal Service decisions to open, close, relocate or consolidate post offices. 
   Since its establishment over 200 years ago, with Benjamin Franklin as the first Postmaster General, the United States Postal Service has faithfully delivered the mail to generations of Americans. Across small town America, the post office is still the center of the community, the glue that holds towns like Livingston and Red Lodge, Montana together. 
   Unfortunately, Americans all over have suffered as the Postal Service opens, closes, or moves post offices without considering the impact their decision will have on the community. 
   Today, Senator JEFFORDS and I are introducing legislation to change that. With passage of the Post Office Community Partnership Act, downtown communities will have an increased say in their future. They will have input into Postal Service decisions that affect their communities, and they will be allowed the chance to offer alternatives to Postal Service changes. Under current law, communities have little say when the USPS decides to pull up stakes. Our bill would change that by allowing communities to work with the Postal Service in the decision-making process. 
   With the exception of some minor changes, this is the same bill that we introduced last spring, the one that received 76 votes of support when it was attached to the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill. 
   I was pleased when Senator JEFFORDS and I received such overwhelming support for our legislation in the 105th Congress. 
   However, the amendment was stripped when the Senate and House reconciled their bills; I was very disappointed that the wishes of three in four senators were ignored in passing the final legislation through conference committee. 
   That small communities across America are reeling from the effects of downtown post office closings is evidence enough that their voices need to be heard, and I am confident that this year we will pass this important bill. I believe that with mutual cooperation, the interests of communities and the Postal Service can be served. The nature--indeed the very name--of this legislation is participation. 
   We will not give up the fight. For the sake of small communities everywhere,  I will continue to do my utmost to see that their views are heard and accounted for. I am confident that with this bill's passage our communities and this important American institution may begin a new era of cooperation for the good of all involved. And we can put the community back in the Postal Service. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join Senator JEFFORDS and me in passing this important legislation.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to state very simply but strongly and unequivocally that I support S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, and I support it very strongly. There is a very simple truth. That is, we need to trust our parents, trust our teachers, trust our local school boards. We should do everything in our power to unshackle our children from binding Federal Government-mandated rules that might make sense in Manhattan, NY, but not in Manhattan, MT. 
   Two weeks ago I had the honor of addressing the Montana State legislature, and when I spoke I told them that the time has come to bring the promise of world-class education to every Montanan. I daresay that virtually everyone in this body has made the same statement, because he or she believes it very deeply, when speaking to his or her own legislatures back in their own States or to any group whatsoever that is interested in education. I believe very deeply we must do that. 
   I also believe we need to ingrain that ethic into the hearts and minds of those who care about education all across our country. Indeed, it is similar to the environment. We are the stewards of our children's learning, and our future as a nation very deeply depends on our willingness to invest in them and our teachers and our schools all across our country. 
   We have a moral responsibility to leave this Nation's children prepared to meet the challenges ahead. That challenge takes a unique form when we talk about meeting the standards of rural States. Nearly 40 percent of the children who go to school in America every day go to a rural school in a small town, yet somehow we as a nation invest only 22 percent of our total education funding in these students. Rural students are being shortchanged by a ratio of 2 to 1. I will work hard this year to see that every student in America, whether in urban America or in rural America, is provided for fairly and equally.  
   But money alone is not enough. The Federal Government must be a partner in education with parents, teachers, and local schools, not an obstacle. Ed-Flex is the right step to take for our children. All Ed-Flex does is say to States, if you come up with a better way to do your job, we will get out of your way and let you do it. Right now, a well-meaning but confusing and distant Federal bureaucracy too often stands in their way. Let me give some examples. 
   Say Federal funds allowed a small Montana school, or even a large New York City school, to purchase computers for students with disabilities. Those computers probably will not get used all day long, and it makes sense that these computers be utilized to help other students when disabled students do not need them. But Federal rules prevent other students from using those computers. Does that make sense? No. So, under Ed-Flex, States can get a waiver and use these computers to educate all our children. 
   Another example: If a school has over 50 percent of its students who are under the poverty line, they can mix all of their Federal funds together, pool them with State funds, and create programs that help every student in that school. But what about schools in the next bracket, with between one-third and one-half of their students under the poverty line? In those schools, money for disadvantaged children must be spent directly on those children, even if that same money can be used in ways that will better educate the disadvantaged children and every other student in that school. 
   The other day I talked to my very good friend, Nancy Keenan. Who is Nancy Keenan? She is the superintendent of public instruction for my State. There is no better friend to Montana schoolchildren than Nancy Keenan. She tells me that right now these schools beat their heads up against Federal rules, trying to untangle the redtape and convince folks over 2,000 miles away, back in Washington, DC, that their local plans make sense. It is very, very depressing. If this bill passes, Montana--all States--could get waivers so the schools could deal directly with the Nancys of the country, and their parents and teachers, to find a solution that works better for every child. 
   It is time to restore trust back to the people. Right now, 12 States have been granted the right by Congress to experiment with education flexibility. You will not hear one Senator from those States stand up with even one instance where education flexibility has not worked. In fact, every State agrees that it allowed local folks to form partnerships, to create plans that work to better educate their children. That is all we want. We want our parents, our teachers, and local school boards, all working together, to give our children the very best. The Federal Government must be a better partner. We ought to do everything in our power to help our children. It is that simple. 
   I believe the bill before us, Ed-Flex, is the right way to take care of it and I applaud Senators WYDEN and FRIST for their efforts. I very much hope this passes quickly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   This bill is a good beginning for a discussion in the Senate on how we can begin to develop constructive solutions to the problem of global climate change. 
   Climate change is real. Over the last 130 years, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, global average surface temperatures have increased by one degree. Scientists project that this trend will continue and most of them  believe the trend is due to increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. The temperature increase may not sound like much, but the consequences of even such a small global change could be enormous. This warming trend could have many effects, including even more unpredictable weather patterns, and major shifts in agricultural soils and productivity and wildlife habitat. To me, that drives home the need to deal with the problem. 
   As I have mentioned to some of my colleagues, there is a vivid example of the warming in my home state of Montana. The Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park has retreated over 3,100 feet over the past century. If this continues, Park Service scientists predict this 10,000 year old glacier will be entirely gone within 30 years. This glacier is a symbol and treasure to Montanans and its disappearance would be a hard thing to explain to our children and their children. 
   This and other potential consequences of climate change are serious enough to warrant some action to reduce the threat it poses. The bill we are introducing today will hopefully be an incentive for people to take steps toward reducing the threat. This bill, the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act, would allow those who voluntarily choose to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases or to ``sequester'' them (meaning to keep them out of the atmosphere and in the soil or locked up in trees or plants) to get credit for those efforts. At some point in the near future, these credits are expected to have monetary value and could be sold in a domestic or global trading system. 
   As my cosponsors acknowledge, this is not a perfect bill, but a complicated work in progress. As the Senate considers this matter, I am particularly interested in seeing how agriculture and forestry might benefit by participating in a credit system. These credits could be a financial reward for the good stewardship already taking place on America's farmland. Agriculture needs every opportunity to pursue markets, even if we're talking about unconventional products like carbon credits, to help with the bottom line. 
   We already know that crop residue management and conservation tillage vastly improve carbon storage in soils and have side benefits, such as reducing erosion. Soils have an immense potential for locking up carbon so that it enters the atmosphere more gradually. Returning highly erodible cropland to perennial grasses could prove to be similarly effective. Many of these practices are already an important part of precision agriculture, so would be obvious low-cost ways for farmers and ranchers to earn credits. It is important that the rules of any trading system be written right, so they can work for agriculture. We can't let our international competitors, like Canada or Australia, be the only ones writing the rules in this developing market. 
   Besides rewarding those who are willing to take early actions and move beyond normal business practices to address climate change, let's start to think outside the box about what else we can do. The U.S. has the most advanced environmental technology sector in the world. From new uses for agricultural waste and products to state-of-the-art pollution controls, we are leaders in improving efficiency and reducing waste. We need to jump start our public and private research and development structure so that it really focuses on new cost-effective products and systems that produce less greenhouse gas to meet a global demand. 
   The Administration's Climate Change Technology Initiative is a reasonable first step. But, so far, Congress has approached this issue with a business as usual attitude. It's time to get serious and creative about developing more advanced technologies. We should be reviewing all the tools at our disposal, from research and development programs to taxes. 
   We need to make this investment in our environmental future for the same reasons that we make investments in our economic future. People prepare for retirement because they want to reduce risks and reduce the cost of responding to future problems. For similar reasons, we need to make prudent investments like providing credit for early action, to reduce risks and reduce the cost of responding to future climate change problems. The more time we let go by, and the longer we let greenhouse gas concentrations rise unchecked, the more expensive the future's repair bills could be. 
   There is still a long way to go with any climate change treaty. There must be real participation by the developing countries, like China, India, Brazil, etc. Carbon trading rules and the role of agriculture in sequestering carbon must be more clearly defined. In the meantime, however, the bill we're introducing will allow us to see what works and to get a leg up on the rest of the world. 
   Mr. President, this bill starts an important dialogue about our country's contribution to world greenhouse gas concentrations. Make no mistake, there is still a lot of work ahead for all of us to make this bill a reality. But this country cannot afford to play the part of the ostrich with its head in the sand. We must seriously engage this matter. We owe it to our children.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in my view, public service is the most noble human endeavor. Today, more than ever, we must look to the younger generation as leaders for tomorrow. For their commitment to community service, I am pleased to recognize two of Montana's young leaders. 
   Their community work demonstrates an ability to make a difference in the lives of others. The work of these two young Montanans sets an impressive standard for their peers. 
   I would like to congratulate and honor two young Montana students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Mindi Kimp of Corvallis, Montana, and Jill Lombardi of Helena, Montana, have been named State Honorees in The 1999 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school and one middle school student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
   Ms. Kimp is being recognized for her work in coordinating a ``senior citizen prom'' for seniors living in Missoula and Ravalli counties. Mindi, a 4-H member and junior class president, enjoys a close relationship with her grandparents. In helping to plan her own Hamilton High School prom, she conceived the idea of a senior citizen prom. She believed that this would be a great way to honor grandparents and help restore faith in today's younger generation. Mindi worked closely with the Council on Aging in planning the event. She solicited donations to make the event free to all seniors. She also used it to provide prizes, decorations, and a rose for every lady. The event was so successful that she will speak at the State Student Council Convention on how to plan a senior citizen prom.  The event will now be held annually at Hamilton High School. 
   Ms. Lombardi, a member of the Helena Youth Advisory Council, is being recognized for her leadership role in two projects: a skateboard park and ``Martin Luther King Volunteer Day.'' Jill served on and established the first-ever Helena Youth Advisory Council. As a member, Jill recruited interested skateboarders to advise the council on the design of the park. She also helped to obtain a $50,000 grant from the Turner Foundation for the park's construction. In planning the volunteer day, Jill worked with the council to organize activities such as community clean-up and youth reading programs. She recruited volunteers, analyzed community needs, arranged volunteer projects, and coordinated celebration activities. The event's success has inspired the council to host the event again next year. 
   Young volunteers like Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. It is important that we recognize their achievements and support their contributions. Numerous statistics indicate that Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, and it is critical that the work of these young people is encouraged. 
   The program that brought these young role models to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. In only four years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with more than 50,000 youngsters participating. 
   Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along with other 1999 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country. While here in Washington, ten will be selected as America's top youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection committee. 
   I heartily applaud Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of Montanans. I also would like to salute two young people in Montana who were named Distinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer service: Nadia Ben-Youssef and Angela Bowlds. 
   All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. These young Montana leaders show commendable community spirit and tremendous promise for America's future.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a Senate Resolution to designate March 24, 1999 as National School Violence Victims Memorial Day. 
   Just last week I spoke to the Montana State Legislature and introduced an education action plan, a major part of which is making sure our kids are safe in America's schools. While I was home I saw Steve Bullock. Steve works for our Attorney General, and every time I see Steve I remember his step-brother, Jeremy. 
   You see, Jeremy was 11. He and his twin brother Joshua left for school together as they always did. The day was April 12, 1994. Jeremy didn't come home from school that day. He was shot and killed on the playground, leaving a family and a community forever changed. 
   By recognizing March 24th as National School Violence Victims Memorial Day we will be honoring the memory of Jeremy Bullock and countless other children, families and communities by saying clearly, with one voice that we as Americans will meet the challenge of eradicating violence from our schools. 
   It is, in many ways a challenge to decide what kind of a people we are. A challenge to stand up for peace and safety against violence and hatred. This is about remembering the victims of school violence and it is about what we are going to do in their names. 
   The easy reaction to this kind of senseless violence is to cast blame and to turn our communities into one big episode of the Jerry Springer show. But we have as a nation, more often than not, chosen what has historically been the more difficult road. The road to peace through dialogue, understanding and compassion. That is what National School Violence Victims Memorial Day is all about. 
   Seventy five years ago, Mahatma Ghandi put it this way. He said ``I discovered that pursuit of truth did not permit violence being inflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience.'' 
   We must use this day to teach and to learn. We must talk about the 225,000 victims of violent crime. We must act to make schools safer for parents, teachers and students and we must learn from our mistakes. 
   And we are always learning. Learning the lessons of the past, committed to using that knowledge to build a better tomorrow. So let us enact this resolution, resolved to working together as one community of people to make America a better place. A place where patience wins out over bloodshed and where truth, as Ghandi said, does not permit violence. 
   And let us always remember Jeremy Bullock. For though he is gone, his memory will help fuel our work. When I think of Jeremy I am always reminded of a poem called For The Fallen that goes this way: 
 They shall not grow old, as we that are left to grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize an outstanding group of Montana students. Recently, the Bozeman High School Marching Band and Color Guard earned the opportunity to perform in the Rose Bowl Parade in Pasadena, CA. By the sounds of the crowd of onlookers, it is safe to say that they stole the show. It was a beautiful day for a parade, and the Bozeman High School Marching Band and Color Guard took advantage of the opportunity to make a name for themselves. Over the past few years, Montana students have truly become competitive in academics, athletics, and the arts. The Bozeman High School band is just one of the many examples where Montana students are gaining national recognition. There are few appearances by Montana High Schools at events of this caliber, but rest assured, there are many more to come. 
   Under the direction of Russ and Loralee Newbury, these students worked extremely hard to prepare for this prestigious event. They represented their school, city, county, and state with great enthusiasm and talent. I know that I speak for the people of Bozeman and the State of Montana when I say that I am very proud of these students. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate every one of these students on a job well done.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from the State of Montana on the introduction of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act. The legislation ratifies the Compact approved by the State and the Tribe in 1997. Senator BURNS and I jointly introduced this legislation in the 105th Congress and had the 2nd Session of that Congress lasted a few more weeks, I believe the bill would have been approved by the Senate. The introduction of this bill is the culmination of 16 years of extensive technical studies and six years of rather intensive negotiations in our state involving the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the Montana state government, off-Reservation county and municipal governments in north-central Montana, local ranchers, and the United States Departments of Justice and Interior. 
   The 122,000-acre Rocky Boy's Reservation sits west of Havre, Montana on several tributaries of the Milk River on what was formerly the Fort Assiniboine Military Reserve. Unfortunately, the portion of the land reserved for the Chippewa Cree is rough and arid. Without irrigation, much of the land is not suitable for farming. Recent studies have demonstrated that the Reservation could not sustain the membership of the Chippewa Cree Tribe as a permanent homeland without an infusion of additional water. The development of a viable reservation economy calls for more water for drinking purposes, as well as for agriculture and other municipal uses. In 1982, acting in its fiduciary capacity as trustee for the Tribe, the United States filed a claim for the water rights of the Chippewa Cree in the State of Montana general stream adjudication. Were it not for the negotiated settlement represented by this legislation, divisive and costly litigation would be pending between the State, the Tribe, the United States and non-Indian ranchers for many years to come. Fortunately, in 1979, the Montana legislature articulated a policy in favor of negotiation and established the Montana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate ``compacts for the equitable division and apportionment of waters between the state and its people and several Indian tribes claiming reserved water rights within the state.'' 
   From the initial meeting in 1992, to the conclusion of an agreed on water rights Compact in 1997, the State, the Federal Government and the Tribe acted in good faith and worked together to explore options. This culminated in passage of a resolution by the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council to ratify the Compact on January 9, 1997. Following overwhelming approval by the Montana Legislature and appropriation of funds for implementation, Governor Marc Racicot signed the Compact into state law on April 14, 1997. Subsequent negotiation, in which staff from my office assisted the State and Tribe, resulted in approval by the United States Departments of the Interior and Justice and drafting of this bill by the three parties. 
   The litigation filed in state water court in 1982 is stayed pending the outcome of this bill. Once passed, the United States, the Tribe and the State of Montana will petition the Montana Water Court to enter a decree reflecting the water rights of the Tribe. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this very positive legislation and work with Senator BURNS and Montana's Congressman HILL, who has simultaneously introduced this bill in the House, to secure passage of the Settlement Act this year. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to expeditious passage of this historic settlement.

   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in supporting tax incentives for alternative fuels. Our country has assumed a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gases because of the global importance of pollution reduction. As my colleagues have also pointed out, promotion of alternative fuels is not just an environmental issue, but an issue important to our domestic economy and independence as well. We cannot afford to slip back toward policies which will leave us dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our economic growth. 
   With the huge reserves of coal and lignite in the United States and around the world, as well as the tremendous potential for use of biomass, wind energy, and other alternatives, it is particularly important to our economy and the world's environment that new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought to market here and in developing nations. 
   But bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In particular, finding investors to take a new technology from the laboratory to the market is difficult because so many technical problems need full-scale testing and operations to resolve. Few investors are prepared to take on the risks associated with bringing a first-of-a-kind, full-  sized alternative energy production facility on-line without some level of security provided by a partnership with the federal government. 
   Tax incentives represent our government's willingness to work with the private sector as a partner to bring new, clean energy technologies to the market. These incentives demonstrate our country's commitment to the future.

    Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the Food and Medicine for the World Act. 
   For years the United States has enacted economic sanctions to punish foreign governments, often without regard for the effects of those sanctions back home. Under a bill that I am introducing jointly with Senators ASHCROFT, BROWNBACK and KERREY, we can make more sense of our confusing sanctions policy. We can put an end to the practice of making our agricultural producers shoulder most of the blame when we impose sanctions. 
   The exchange of goods and ideas worldwide has never been freer; it is now axiomatic to say that we live in a global economy. It follows that as the rules governing economics have changed, so too should those related to economic sanctions. Unilateral economic action is less effective than it used to be, simply because it's rarely possible for one country or company to corner the market on a good or service. 
   Moreover, we often hurt ourselves with unilateral actions that disproportionately affect one sector of our economy over another. Our agricultural producers, for example, have long borne the brunt of American unilateral action. It is estimated that 10% of the world wheat market is put out of reach of U.S. producers by economic sanctions. 
   That's why I became a member of the Senate Sanctions Task Force last year, and it's why I am joining my colleagues in introducing the Food and Medicine for the World Act. Under this legislation, when any new unilateral sanction is announced by the President, the sanctions he imposes will not affect agriculture or medicine unless: the President submits a report to Congress asking that the sanction include agriculture; and Congress approves of his request. The process must be complete within 60 days before the sanctions against agriculture are supposed to go into effect. This bill would not take effect in the event that Congress has declared war or in the case of national emergency. 
   Mr. President, while I believe sanctions can be a legitimate tool of foreign policy, I don't think that American producers should be punished for the actions of unscrupulous foreign governments. Nor do I think it is fair to put an abrupt end to the supply of medicine based on the behavior of a dictator. We must send a message to the world that our producers are reliable and that those abroad who rely on U.S. products will not be put at risk by a sanction on U.S. food and medicine. 
   The Food and Medicine for the World Act sends that message, and I urge my colleagues to lend their support to the bill.
