    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise proudly today to congratulate Clifford Pierce Middle School in Merrillville, Indiana for its selection by the U.S. Secretary of Education as one of the nation's outstanding Blue Ribbon Schools. Clifford Pierce Middle School is one of only two Indiana schools, and one of only 198 schools across the country, to be awarded this prestigious recognition. 
   In order to be recognized as a Blue Ribbon School, Clifford Pierce Middle School met rigorous criteria for overall excellence. The teachers and administration officials demonstrated to the Secretary of Education the qualities necessary to prepare successfully our young people for the challenges of the new century, and proved that the students at Clifford Pierce Middle School effectively met local, state and national goals. 
   Hoosiers can be very proud of our Blue Ribbon schools. The students and faculty of Clifford Pierce Middle School have shown a consistent commitment to academic excellence and community leadership. Clifford Pierce Middle School has raised the bar for educating our children and for nurturing strong values. This Hoosier school provides a clear example as we work to improve the quality of education in Indiana and across the Nation.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as the author of the Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act, a bipartisan bill to prevent fraud against seniors. 
   The Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act is extremely important because seniors are disproportionately victims of telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud. Even though Americans over the age of 50 account for approximately 27% of the United States population, they comprise 56% of the ``mooch lists'' used by fraudulent telemarketers. Unfortunately, fraudulent telemarketers prey upon the trusting nature of seniors and as a result seniors lose approximately $14.8 billion each year. 
   This can be prevented if seniors are educated about their consumer rights and are informed about methods that are available to them to confirm the legitimacy of an investment or product. According to a national survey, 70% of older fraud victims say it is difficult to identify when fraud is happening and 40% of older Americans cannot distinguish between a legitimate and a fraudulent telemarketing sales call. There is a need to educate seniors about the dangers of fraud and how to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. As a first step to educate seniors in my state of Indiana about fraud prevention, I held a Special Committee on Aging field hearing on protecting seniors from fraud. 
   I heard testimony from two victims of investment scams in which both lost a large sum of their retirement. Mrs. Georgeanne MaCurdy lost close to $150,000 and Mr. Owen Saltzgaver lost close to $50,000. Mr. Saltzgaver said ``It was a scam from the beginning, I wish I knew,'' and Mrs. Georgeanne MaCurdy stated ``It is the first thing I think of when I get up in the morning and the last thing I think of when I go to sleep. I thought I could trust him.'' 
   At this hearing I highlighted the Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act. This bill would provide necessary resources to local programs part of the National Association of TRIADs, a community-policing program that partners law enforcement agencies with senior volunteers to reduce crime and fraud against the elderly. There are 725 counties with TRIADs nationwide. They help more than 16 million seniors. During the field hearing, Captain Ed Friend, the leader of the TRIAD program in South Bend, Indiana, testified about the importance of combating fraud and how the South Bend TRIAD program has been providing seminars to Seniors on fraud prevention. He made clear that without federal funding TRIADs' nationwide efforts would have to cease. The authorization for Federal funding provided in this bill should ensure the continuation of TRIADs' efforts. In order to assist TRIAD with those efforts, this bill also requires the Health and Human Services Department to disseminate information to seniors on fraud prevention through the Area Agencies on Aging and other existing senior-focused programs. 
   In addition to educating seniors, this bill contains provisions which would include seniors in the crime victimization survey and would require the United States Attorney General to conduct a study of crimes committed against seniors. I thank Senator LEAHY for his leadership on this issue. These provisions would allow Congress to gather more information on crimes against seniors in order to react with appropriate legislative action. 
   Education is one of many steps that needs to be taken to prevent fraud. I also introduced the ``Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act'' this year to increase enforcement measures and toughen penalties against those promoting fraudulent schemes through mass-marketing. Education and tougher penalties will hopefully protect seniors from fraud. 
   Protecting seniors from fraud is of growing importance as our population ages and more seniors save more money for their retirement. Our seniors deserve to be informed and their investments deserve to be secure. I urge the Senate to consider this bipartisan legislation and pass it prior to adjournment.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a remarkable young athlete from the great state of Indiana. 
   Yesterday, Americans watched with pride as 23 year-old Lindsay Benko and her teammates captured the gold medal in the 4x200 freestyle swim relay. The team did it in style, setting an Olympic record with their time of 7:57.80. 
   With that victory, Lindsay became the first Hoosier to win a medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. 
   Lindsay hails from Elkhart, Indiana, a small town in the shadow of Notre Dame's famous golden dome. In a town where football rules, today it is Lindsay Benko who has captured the headlines and inspired pride in Elkhart and South Bend. 
   Like so many other Olympic athletes, Lindsay has been preparing for her Olympic moment since she was very young, in fact, she has been swimming competitively since she was eight years old. Lindsay has dedicated her life to a sport she loves, and worked hard to be among the best. As early as her freshman year at Elkhart Central High School, she was a state champion. In high school, she won a total of eleven state titles, four in the 100 meter freestyle, four in the 200 meter freestyle, and three in the 400 meter freestyle relay. After graduation, Lindsay took her competitive fire and winning Hoosier spirit to the University of Southern California, where she won a total of five NCAA individual titles. 
   Yesterday, Lindsay conquered her sport at a new level. She can now be called a world-class athlete and a world champion, but we will continue to proudly claim her as our own in the state of Indiana. 
   Mr. President, I join my friends in Elkhart, South Bend and across Indiana in congratulating Lindsay Benko for her outstanding accomplishment, and wishing the best of luck to all of our nation's Olympic athletes as they compete in the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the humanitarian work of James Kelley of Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
   For many years, Mr. Kelley has been known for his successes as an entrepreneur and philanthropist in Indiana. He founded the Kelley Automotive group in 1952 which now employs over 1200 employees in both Indiana and Georgia. His dedication to public service has been evident through his service on the boards of the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce, Junior Achievement, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Boys and Girls Club of Fort Wayne, the YMCA, Fort Wayne National Bank, the Fort Wayne Aviation Museum, and the Arthritis Foundation. 
   Recently, Mr. Kelley has devoted his energies to developing a grain business in the Republic of Moldova. The Republic of Moldova is a small country approximately the size of Indiana with a population of 4.8 million people. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova has been struggling to successfully transition from a communist system to a democratic republic. 
   One of the greatest challenges facing this burgeoning country is that of economic development. In 1999 the per capita income in Moldova was only $2,200 and inflation was at 43 percent. Through his purchase of a grain elevator and his partnership with the farmers of Moldova, Mr. Kelley has been able to loan local farmers feed, fertilizer, and fuel. In the near future, he plans to introduce modern farming techniques that will increase crop  yields. The Kelley Grain company is considered to be one of the primary economic development initiatives in the nation, and Mr. Kelley's work has been recognized by both the former and current prime ministers of Moldova. 
   In addition to his economic endeavors, Mr. Kelley has taken his philanthropic activities abroad as well. While in Moldova, he noticed a deficiency in their health care system and organized a medical team to travel to Moldova. While there, this team trained physicians and nurses in techniques to implant pacemakers, provided much needed supplies for cardiovascular surgeries, provided consultation and echocardiographic imaging at the cardiology center, visited pediatric wards and orphanages, and provided the rural city of Gaushen with antibiotics, blood pressure cuffs, and antihypertensive medications. 
   I would like to commend James Kelley for his efforts and tireless dedication to helping the people of this struggling country. His humanitarian work in the Republic of Moldova can only enhance the relationship between our two countries. I am honored to be able to recognize his contributions and wish him continued success in the future.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the ``Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000.'' This bill brings together very important initiatives for making long-term care more affordable for Americans. In particular, this bill contains a $3,000 tax credit for caregivers and a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance. 
   There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal needs or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 years old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. The government spent approximately $32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing home costs. If you add up all the private sector and government spending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend caring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the Alzheimers Association indicated, caregivers provide $196 billion worth of care a year. 
   As a member of the Special Committee on Aging, I held a field hearing in Indiana on making long-term care more affordable. At this hearing, I learned first hand the importance of this tax credit. Jerry and Sue Cahee take care of Jerry's mother who has Alzheimers. At the hearing Jerry Cahee shared the following: ``Mother is a wonderful and friendly person to everyone--except her caregivers. We have discovered that life, aging, and illness are not fair. We have discovered that love is hard--that love is not enough to make the difference. We know that memories are all that we have left of the happy times in Mother's life. To care for her, make her last days comfortable, to meet her ever increasing medical needs, to offer her the security of a loving safe home, and to let her know that she is loved--these things have become our purpose for living. The financial drain has been difficult, the emotional strains are enormous.'' 
   Paul Severance, the Director of United Senior Action, a senior advocacy group in Indiana represented his constituency at the hearing when he stated ``The burden on families who are trying to provide long-term care at home is tremendous; they typically face substantial expenses for special care, such as nursing visits, they often have lost wages because of the demands of caring for a loved one; and there can be a great cost to their own health as a result of the constant demands of caregiving.'' 
   In addition to the tax credit, a deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance makes it more affordable for Americans to purchase long-term care policies that can provide them with the coverage they will need. Congress needs to continue to explore ways in which to ensure long-term care options are available for all Americans. 
   I am encouraged by the introduction of this bill and the bipartisan support it has received. It is my hope that we can work together to implement this legislation and make it more affordable for seniors to receive long-term care. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of eliminating the marriage penalty for working families. Eliminating the marriage penalty--which results when a married couple pays more in taxes than they would if they had remained single--is the right thing to do. Unfortunately, the approach the majority offers is fiscally irresponsible and provides more than half its benefits to couples who pay no marriage penalty. By contrast, the approach I support provides tax relief only to those who actually pay marriage penalties, and it allows us to provide additional, targeted tax cuts. 
   A few months ago, I introduced my own approach to the marriage penalty problem, the Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000, S. 2043. My bill provides a dollar-for-dollar tax credit--up to a maximum of $500 in 2001, rising to $1,700 in 2004--that reduces or eliminates the marriage penalty on a couple's earned income. My bill provides immediate marriage penalty relief to millions of American families, completely eliminating the penalty for 59 percent of families that face a penalty in the first year. Plus, it provides tax relief only to those families who currently pay more when they marry than they would if they had remained single, which is the true measure of the marriage penalty. 
   Because it is more targeted to those with marriage penalties, my bill is also more fiscally responsible. The Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act costs $80 billion over ten years--$33 billion in the five-year reconciliation window--or just over $10 billion a year by the year 2010. It costs only one-third as much as the Republican plan, yet it eliminates the marriage penalty within four years for more than 80 percent of families. 
   In other words, Mr. President, my bill is targeted, simple, and affordable, as is the Democratic alternative offered by Senator MOYNIHAN. Both approaches allow us to honestly deal with  the marriage penalty while also providing enough room for other priorities, such as prescription drug coverage, a college tuition tax credit, or a long term care tax credit. Given the likelihood that the Democratic alternative will fail, and the Republican bill will be vetoed by the President, it is my hope that my proposal will eventually receive serious consideration. 
   Compare the advantages of both the Democratic alternative and the Bayh approach to the Republican bill that we are debating here today. The Republican bill is expensive, costing $248 billion over ten years and $56 billion over five years. If allowed to continue until the year 2010, it would cost more than $40 billion every year. The bill is poorly targeted, with nearly 60 percent of the total tax relief going to couples who today pay less in tax when they marry, rather than more. 
   In addition, the Republican bill provides immediate relief only to a small number of families because it phases in over a seven-year period. In fact, the Republican bill has not even completely phased in by the end of the five-year budget window, thereby hiding its true cost. 
   I appreciate the argument made by the other side of the aisle that with significant surpluses on the horizon, some of that money ought to be returned to taxpayers. I also agree that we ought to do something about the marriage penalty, because people should not have to pay more tax simply because they fall in love and get married, as the two Senators from Texas point out often with both irony and humor. But unfortunately, eliminating the marriage penalty is not the only challenge we face. The majority's proposal severely hampers our ability to cut other taxes, pay down the debt, and make needed investments in Medicare and education. It provides most relief for those who pay no marriage penalty and offers incomplete relief for those who do. I support a better, more balanced approach and look forward to the day when it is adopted.

   Mr. BAYH. I thank Senator SCHUMER. 
   Mr. President, I express my profound appreciation to the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, for his leadership on this critical issue. It is important to the families and the children of this country that we adopt this important amendment to make college tuition more affordable for all families across my State and the other States that constitute our great country. 
   A college education today is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. Helping to make college tuition more affordable, by providing for the deduction of the first $10,000 of college tuition, will help ease the burdens on many middle-class families across Indiana and elsewhere in our country. It will open up the doors of economic opportunity to the middle class and help to make our Nation a more decent, just, and honorable place as well. 
   As we move to adopt this important amendment today, we will not only do what is right for our economy but we will also do what is right for our families and for our children. This is an example of cutting taxes in ways that help middle-class families deal with the challenges they face in their daily lives. It is an important issue, one that surely we can accomplish within the context of also moving to ease the burdens of estate taxes upon businessmen, farmers, and others across our State. 
   I say to my colleague from New York, I again thank him for his leadership. This is a critically important issue. It is one whose time has come. I say to Senator SCHUMER, I cannot think of anything that would be more popular across the State of Indiana than acting today to help make the costs of college more affordable for middle-class families, for students and children across our State, by passing this important amendment. It has been my honor and privilege to work with the Senator on this important issue. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to support our amendment because it not only provides for substantial estate tax relief, but it also provides for substantial tax cuts for millions of American families, in providing for long-term care for sick and elderly dependents, and also provides for important tax relief for millions of American families who work hard, play by the rules, are self-employed, but struggle to meet the costs of health insurance. 
   I express my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator DURBIN, Senator FEINGOLD, and others, for their leadership in bringing us to this point, and for their support of these critical and important steps. 
   I want to make clear that I strongly support the cause of providing for estate tax relief. That is why I am delighted to say that our approach provides, when fully implemented, that 99.3 percent of the American people--99.3 percent--will be entirely exempt from any estate taxes in our country. 
   This means that fully 95 percent of farms that would currently be subject to the estate tax have their estate tax liability eliminated entirely, and 75 percent of small businesses currently subject to the estate tax will have their estate tax liability eliminated entirely. 
   In a perfect world, I would also support the elimination of the other one-tenth of 1 percent of families in our country who will still be subject to the estate tax. But we have other priorities which must also be met. 
   One of the foremost among these is the fact that currently 2.6 million families across our country struggle to provide care 
   for a sick, elderly parent in their home. This figure is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because, among other facts, those in our country over the age of 65 will more than double during that period of time. 
   We find too many families today caught in what we refer to as the ``sandwich generation,'' struggling not only to provide for their children, pay the mortgage, put food on the table, but also to care for a sick, elderly parent or grandparent. It is not right in our country that families must be forced to choose between caring for a child or caring for a parent. They deserve tax relief, too. 
   That is exactly what our bill would do, providing up to a $3,000 tax credit every year, once fully phased in, to help alleviate those burdens, allowing families to meet all of their priorities, and particularly to provide for long-term care for a sick, elderly parent or other dependent. 
   Likewise, it is not right that so many of our families currently work and struggle to provide for the cost of health insurance. Just last year, one million fewer Americans had health insurance, and many of these are self-employed. Under our approach, we would accelerate the full deductibility for the cost of health insurance for those who are self-employed to next year, providing an additional 2 years of tax relief for hard-working Americans. 
   In conclusion, let me say this. It has been eloquently stated by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that death should not be a taxable event, and they are right. But it is equally true no family in our country should face the painful dilemma of providing care for their children or care for their parents. That is not right. They deserve our help. They deserve tax cuts, too. 
   It is not right that hard-working Americans, who play by the rules, pay their taxes, and get up and go to work every day, struggle to make ends meet, and provide for health care. They deserve tax cuts. They deserve our help, too. 
   That is exactly what our bill would provide. It meets our priorities, it is financially responsible, and it is true to our enduring values. That is why I encourage my colleagues to adopt this important amendment. 
   I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, my friend and colleague, Mr. DURBIN.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator KENNEDY's skills training amendment. This amendment contains important measures to provide individuals with the necessary skills to succeed in the workforce. The amendment addresses the need to provide employment skills training to noncustodial parents, particularly fathers. The ``Fathers Work, Families Win'' initiative begins to address a very troubling epidemic, fatherlessness. 
   The number of children living in households without fathers has tripled over the last forty years, from just over five million in 1960 to more than 17 million today. Although the work of single mothers is truly heroic, father absence has caused unnecessary burdens on women and has forced millions of children to overcome difficult social hurdles. For example, children that live absent their biological fathers are five times more likely to live in poverty. They are more likely to bring weapons and drugs into the classroom, to commit a crime, to drop out of school, to be abused, to commit suicide, to abuse alcohol or drugs, and to become pregnant as teenagers. The $255 million requested for this initiative is dwarfed in comparison by the amount of money the Federal Government spends on dealing with the consequences of fatherlessness. 
   There are several pieces to this puzzle, one of which is employment services. Too many fathers are unable to provide financial support for their children. Although many of these fathers have the desire to take responsibility for their children, they do not have the means. In short, these fathers are not dead-beat, they are dead-broke. The ``Fathers Work, Families Win'' initiative gives us a way to work through the current infrastructure to deliver employment services to fathers and noncustodial parents. Skill-building and employment services will help to increase the employment rate among noncustodial fathers and therefore, increase child support payments. 
   Our challenge is to give fathers the tools necessary to be successful parents. While employment services for noncustodial parents is an essential component to making fathers responsible, it is not the only service that is needed to ensure these fathers become good parents. Senator DOMENICI and I have introduced a comprehensive package designed to address the fatherlessness epidemic. S. 1364, the Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999 would provide states with funds to promote the maintenance of married, two-parent families, strengthen fragile families, and promote responsible fatherhood. In addition to the program grants available to states, states would receive funds for a media campaign. A media campaign would be an effective way to communicate the message of father responsibility across ethnic, racial, and income barriers. The bill also recognizes the need to remove federal disincentives to pay child support. 
   We face a great challenge, but we must not let it overwhelm us. We must instead begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I commend Senator KENNEDY for including the ``Fathers Work, Families Win'' initiative in his amendment. It is my hope that the Senate will enact this legislation and continue to pursue other solutions to the epidemic of fatherlessness.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President. It is with great pride that I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and a great man, former United States Congressman John Brademas. I am honored to introduce legislation designating the United States Post Office located at 424 South Michigan Street in South Bend, Indiana, as the ``John Brademas Post Office.'' 
   John Brademas was born on March 2, 1927, in Mishawaka, Indiana, a small town in Indiana's third congressional district, which he would later represent for more than two decades (1959-1981). John's father was a Greek immigrant restauranteur and his mother was a Hoosier school teacher. Upon graduation from high school, John joined the Navy and soon thereafter became a Veterans National Scholar at Harvard University, from which he graduated with a B.A., Magna Cum Laude, in 1949. From 1950 to 1953, he studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, England, receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Studies. 
   From 1955 to 1956, John Brademas served as Executive Assistant to the late Adlai E. Stevenson, where he assumed research responsibilities during the 1956 Presidential campaign. Three years later, John Brademas became the first native-born American of Greek origin to be elected to Congress. In the House, he quickly became a leader in the areas of education, the arts and humanities, as well as a staunch defender of the rights of the disabled and the elderly. During his service on the House Committee on Education and Labor, Congressman Brademas was largely responsible for writing major federal legislation concerning elementary and secondary education, higher education, vocational education, as well as support for libraries, museums, and the arts and humanities. 
   Congressman Brademas was also the chief House sponsor of the Education for all Handicapped Children Act; the Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Affairs Act; and the Older Americans Comprehensive Services Act. In 1977, Congressman Brademas was chosen by his colleagues for the influential position of House Majority Whip, in which he served for his last four years in office. Among his numerous accomplishments, Congressman Brademas was responsible for attaining the necessary funding for the very same Post Office that I seek to name in his honor. 
   Today, Congressman Brademas is President Emeritus of New York University, where he served as President from 1981-1992. During that time, he led the transition of New York University from a regional commuter school to a national and international research university. In addition to his responsibilities at New York University, he is the Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy and serves as co-chairman for the Center on Science, Technology and Congress at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also serves on the Consultants' Panel to the Comptroller General of the United States. 
   During his long and distinguished service, both as a leader in government and a leader in higher education, John Brademas has provided inspiration and guidance to two generations of men and women committed to public service and to education. I want to thank Congressman Brademas for his enduring contributions to the State of Indiana and the nation. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that the Postal facility located at 424 South Michigan Street will soon bear the name of my good friend and fellow Hoosier, former Congressman John Brademas.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the colloquy that just occurred in which Senator STEVENS promised to return the $1.9 billion taken from the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, to fund the programs in the Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill, during conference. I thank Senators ROTH, STEVENS, MOYNIHAN and BYRD for recognizing the importance of S-CHIP and the federal promise to the states. 
   I applaud this agreement. This program allows states, like Indiana, to continue to enroll and provide services to children in low-income families. In Indiana, over 120,000 additional children have been enrolled in ``Hoosier Healthwise'' since S-CHIP was implemented in 1998. The removal of this funding would have had a devastating impact on Indiana. For every $1 million in federal funding taken from Indiana, 830 children would not be covered by Hoosier Healthwise. These children would be unlikely to obtain quality health care. 
   This is not an issue that only affects Indiana. Thirty-five Senators from both political parties joined with me and Senator VOINOVICH to send a letter to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE urging them to work to restore the $1.9 billion taken from the program. The National Governors' Association stated in a letter to the leadership that ``The Governors are united in their opposition to the proposed cuts in S-CHIP. This is not a formula fight; this is a weakening of the state-federal partnership that is so vital to the success of this program. It sets a truly disturbing precedent.'' We are grateful to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE for recognizing the need for this funding to be restored. 
   The Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill contains worthy programs but funding for those programs should not have come from important efforts such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I am pleased that this issue will be resolved in the conference.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator RICHARD LUGAR to introduce the Southern District of Indiana Temporary Judgeship Act. This legislation creates an additional temporary judgeship for the Southern District of Indiana to help alleviate the strain experienced over the past five years as a result of an extremely heavy caseload. 
   In the last year alone, the Southern District has seen a higher than average number of case filings with 585 filings per judge, compared to the national average of 493 filings per judge. The Federal Bureau of Prisons ``Death Row'' has recently been located at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is part of the Southern District. As a result, the Southern District anticipates a significant increase in the number of petitions in death habeas cases. In addition, the Southern District of Indiana includes our state capital of Indianapolis, the center of government and politics in the Hoosier State. The court has experienced an increase in the number of cases which raise political and public policy questions. The Southern District court is clearly overburdened. 
   The legislation I introduce today is critical to ensuring the delivery of Justice in the Southern District of Indiana. There is wide agreement about the need for this additional judgeship and, in fact, the Judicial Conference has called on Congress to add a temporary judge. I urge my colleagues to give this legislation their serious consideration and support. I thank the President and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hatch amendment and in support of the approach taken by Senator KENNEDY. I do so because I believe that an 18-month study is no adequate substitute for the prompt, vigorous, assurance of civil rights for every American. 
   The crimes described in Senator KENNEDY's approach are not ordinary offenses. They strike at the heart of a pluralistic society. They strike at all of us, not just the individual victims. We need to look no further, colleagues, than to the Balkans to see what happens when the genie of intolerance and hate is unleashed upon an unhappy land. 
   We must not let that happen. We must not. We fought a civil war in our country to establish the basic principle that certain rights should be guaranteed to every American, regardless of their State of residency. We fight to reestablish that principle once again today. 
   Mr. President, if a study is in order, let it be in addition to establishing these basic rights, not as a replacement therefore. 
   Now is the time for action. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hatch amendment and to support Senator KENNEDY in his approach.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Nathan Hatch for receiving the Senate's approval of his nomination to serve as a member of the National Council on the Humanities. Dr. Hatch has dedicated his life to academia. He currently serves as Provost of the University of Notre Dame and is also a Professor of History. As Provost, Dr. Hatch has focused on three areas: the establishment of academic centers of excellence, including the expansion of the Keough Institute for Irish Studies and the enhancement of the Medieval Institute; revitalization of undergraduate education through the creation of the Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning; and the pursuit of outstanding faculty. 
   Dr. Hatch is considered to be one of the most influential scholars in the study of the history of religion in America. His book, The Democratization of American Christianity, won both the Albert Outler Prize in Ecumenical Church History and the John Hope Franklin Prize for the best book in American Studies; it was also chosen by his peers as one of the two most important books in the study of American religion. 
   Dr. Hatch is a remarkable asset for the University of Notre Dame and the State of Indiana. His experiences at Notre Dame will make him a valuable addition to the National Council on the Humanities. I applaud the Senate today for confirming this outstanding Hoosier.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am somewhat disappointed that our colleague from New Hampshire has left the floor and taken with him the chart with the pictures of the 50 Governors of the States. For 8 years, my picture would have been on that chart, and, I must say, it is a much better looking group now that I am no longer there. 
   All joking aside, if we are going to make progress on this very important issue, it is necessary for us to stop pointing fingers and instead work together to make progress. 
   There was always a tendency, when we gathered as Governors, to point to Washington as the source of many of our problems. Now that I have the privilege of serving in this body, I see from time to time there is a tendency to look at the State and local levels in a similar spirit. The truth is, we need cooperation to make progress on this critical issue. 
   I begin my remarks by giving credit to those who helped us lay the foundation for progress on the Lieberman amendment, which I believe very strongly offers our best chance for a bipartisan compromise and progress to help improve the quality of education for our students. 
   I am pleased my colleague from Connecticut has returned to the floor. Without his courage, dedication, and devotion to this issue, we would not be here today, nor have the opportunity for the progress we now have. I publicly salute Senator LIEBERMAN for his commitment to this very important issue. 
   Secondly, I thank our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, who is still with us on the floor, and Senator DASCHLE, our Democratic leader, for their cooperation in including our accountability provisions within the Democratic alternative that was voted on last week. Also, I thank them for their understanding of our commitment to the importance of targeting  resources to those children who are most in need and making progress on that very critical issue in the days and years ahead. 
   I thank our colleagues on this side of the aisle, the moderate Democrats, the so-called new Democrats, cosponsors on this amendment with Senator LIEBERMAN and myself who have now constituted a critical mass which has moved the discussion beyond stale partisanship and instead into a realm of reconciliation and progress that will enable us to make advancement in the cause of improving the quality of our children's education. 
   Finally, to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I thank them for accepting our outstretched hands. We have had ongoing fruitful negotiations. They are not completed yet. There are still significant, outstanding issues that need to be resolved, but I hope we have helped clear the air around this place to create a climate in which real progress can be made and discussions can take place. We had cordial, substantive discussions on a bipartisan basis, leaving politics at the door and instead focusing on the challenge that concerns us all: providing a quality education for all of America's children, particularly those less fortunate. 
   I care deeply about this issue because I believe improving the quality of education for all of America's children, along with the cause of keeping our nuclear arms under control and addressing the disintegration of the American family, is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is one of the greatest challenges of our time because it is intricately tied up, bound up with addressing the important factors that face the American 
   people today. 
   First, the economy. In an information age, in a globalized world economy, premium upon knowledge, skills, and know-how is more critical to economic success than ever before. Money flows around the globe, technology flows around the globe, and information flows around the globe. People do move but not as much as those other factors I mentioned. If one looks at the long-term competitive advantage of nations, one of the very best things we can do to ensure the future economic vitality of our country is to guarantee that we have a workforce with the skills necessary to compete successfully with our competitors from abroad. 
   I once heard Alan Greenspan speaking to the 50 Governors saying the single most important factor in determining the long-term productivity growth rate which, more than anything else, determines whether we are going to be prosperous as a country or not, is the skill levels of our workers today and the education levels of our children, the workers of tomorrow. So improving the quality of education is critically important to our long-term economic well-being as a society. 
   What kind of society we will be will also be determined by whether we meet the education challenge today. The growing gap between haves and have-nots in our country is really an education gap, a knowledge gap, a skills gap, and if we are going to avoid, for the first time in our Nation's history, being divided into a country of haves and have-nots with an upper class and the lower class almost permanently shut out of opportunity, if we are going to avoid that, it will be because we give every child growing up in our country--even those from the wrong side of the tracks, even those growing up in homes less fortunate than others--the skills necessary to compete and succeed in the world in the 21st century. 
   Finally, the vitality of our democracy is at stake. I believe strongly in something Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of the Democratic Party, once said. Thomas Jefferson happened to be our very first education President as well. He was the founder of the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson once said that a society that expects to be both ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been and never shall be. 
   Jefferson was right when he spoke those words in the early 1800s. If he were alive today, he would realize they resonate with more truth than even when he spoke them. 
   The complexity of the issues we face today, the critical decisions that face the American people require an even greater level of understanding and knowledge than in Thomas Jefferson's day. 
   Our economy, the nature of our society, and the very vibrancy of our democracy are all bound up in the way in which we resolve the educational challenges facing our Nation. This is why many of us have concluded we need to do better. The status quo is not good enough. The solutions of yesterday are inadequate to meet the challenges of tomorrow and the 21st century. 
   My colleague from Connecticut spoke eloquently to many of these factors. I have behind me a chart representing some of the NAEP scores. As you can see, we must do better. Sixty percent of America's children--at least 60 percent--are below proficient when it comes to reading, the very gateway to opportunity and literacy. Seventy-five percent of America's children are below proficient in mathematics, the gateway to sciences and the hard disciplines. 
   For America's less fortunate children, as the chart behind me demonstrates, the progress we need to make is even more significant if they, too, are to share in the fruits and the bounties that constitute the American dream. 
   I used to be amazed at the number of freshmen entering college, particularly in our 2-year institutions and those that are not the flagship sites for our State universities, who, of course, had received high school diplomas but who had to go back in their first year of college matriculation to do high school work. Something had broken down. Something wrong had taken place that they received a high school diploma and yet had to go back and do high school work upon entering college. 
   We are resolved we will do better. Our approach represents not only a significant break from business as usual when it comes to national education policy; it represents a significantly increased national commitment to the cause of improving America's education system for every child with a significantly stepped up Federal commitment. 
   It is woefully inadequate that only one-half of 1 percent of Federal investment today goes into our schools. We must do better. Yet we do not want Federal micromanagement or intrusive Federal control. It has to be a cooperative effort with State and local communities. 
   That is where our approach embodies what I would like to call the sensible center. Let's start with investment. We disagree with those who say no additional resources are necessary because we know we cannot expect our local schools to do the job unless we give them the tools with which to get that job done. 
   Resources. Dollars are an important part of those tools to ensure that they can meet the challenge of giving every child a quality education. But we also disagree with our colleagues who say just more money is the only thing that needs to be done to meet the challenges in education. 
   Instead, we combine significantly increased Federal investment in education with significant accountability and insistence upon results. We provide for a 50-percent increase every year in title I investment; a 90-percent increase in investment for professional development, to ensure that there are qualified, highly motivated teachers in every classroom; a 30-percent increase in investment for innovation, trying new ways to meet the challenges that confront us; and a 50-percent increase in investment for charter schools, magnet schools, and public school choice. 
   We have struck the sensible center: Increased investment, 
   yes, not just throwing more dollars on the problem but insisting upon better education for all of America's children. 
   Accountability. We have also chosen the sensible center there between those who would have no additional accountability and those who would seek micromanagement from Washington, DC. 
   Our approach focuses upon outcomes rather than inputs. We focus upon how much our children can read and write, add and subtract, rather than just how Federal dollars happen to be spent. Accountability is one of the linchpins in educational progress. It is at the heart of our approach. 
   Streamlining. Some would call it consolidation. Again, we struck the sensible center between those who would seek no accountability for the  expenditure of Federal dollars whatsoever--block grants; that is not something we support--and those, on the other hand, who would seek Federal micromanagement. 
   Ours is the solution for the information age. We get away from an industrial age model in which the Federal Government would seek to find one or two solutions that work and impose them upon everyone. 
   Instead, in an era of flexibility and speed, to meet the necessity of rapid change and innovation, we provide for dollars to be targeted at less advantaged students, spent in five broad categories keenly related to academic success but then allowing for the flexibility to tailor-make those investments in ways that will be most meaningful and most productive at the local level because every school district across America is not exactly alike, and, we, at the Federal level, need to recognize that. 
   Senator LIEBERMAN and I have spoken of the targeting. It is vitally important. Again, we need to target the additional investment at those children who are most in need. We provide a factor in our formula that will guarantee that no school district would see their title I funding cut. That, too, defines the sensible center. 
   Finally, let me touch upon a couple of other factors. 
   The importance of competition. We rejected the thinking of those who would go to a purely market-based system of vouchers because in a purely market-based system there are winners and losers. What of the losers? What of them? We have a national commitment to them to ensure that they, too, get the education they need because it would be a tragedy not only for them but for the rest of us if we allowed them to fall through the cracks of educational and lifetime opportunity. But at the same time, we embrace the forces of the marketplace in competition because we know that will provide for more parental choice, greater innovation, and, ultimately, more productivity within the public school system. 
   So we have provided for the forces of the marketplace while retaining the genius of the public education system, which is a commitment to a better education not just for the few, not just for those who would succeed competitively in a marketplace but for everyone. 
   Finally, let me say, once again, I am grateful for the progress that has been made. The seeds of progress have been firmly planted. We cannot yet tell whether they will bear fruit in this session of Congress or in the next. But I thank my colleagues who have brought us to this point, both within my own caucus and those on the other side of the aisle. If we are going to make progress on this important subject, it will be by working together, not pointing fingers or seeking to assign 
   blame. 
   So I will conclude by citing some words spoken by Winston Churchill, in a moment more dramatic than this, when he said: We have surely not reached the end, nor perhaps have we reached the beginning of the end, but at least--at least--we have reached the end of the beginning. 
   So let us begin to make progress for America's schoolchildren. Let us agree, on a bipartisan basis, to increase our commitment to their academic future. Let us agree on the importance of accountability, the forces of competition within the public school system, and the need for professional development. Let us agree upon these things. 
   Let us begin to move forward. If we do, it will not only improve the future for our children and the institutions of academic success across our country, but we will also begin to reinstill the confidence and trust of the American people in their ability to govern themselves. And that, perhaps, is the most important beginning of all. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to call attention to the remarkable letter sent to our Senate leadership by the nearly fifty members of the Council on Competitiveness. The letter points out the importance of basic scientific research to our economy, and shows how such public-sector investments have been on the decline. When so many prominent leaders agree on an issue of public policy, it is incumbent upon us to pay attention to their views. 
   I believe that the recent increases in private-sector research are no substitute for the government's traditional role in funding the most basic research that may or may not yield important discoveries. It is this so-called ``market failure'' in basic research--those making the investments are not assured of positive outcomes, and cannot realistically capture all of the economic gains from new discoveries--that makes the government's role so vitally important. What's more, the private sector's new investments have been increasingly focused on biotechnology and product development, while investment in basic sciences such as math, chemistry, and physics has experienced sharp declines. This has important implications for today's workforce, as well as the rate of innovation that will drive future increases in living standards. 
   While advances in the health sciences, such as the Human Genome Project, are extremely exciting, there are areas in the physical sciences that are on the verge of generating important discoveries, and where government ought to be focusing additional  resources. One area in which I am keenly interested is the area of nanotechnology. This groundbreaking area--which examines structures atom-by-atom and molecule-by-molecule, on the scale of just a few billionths of a meter--may lead to discoveries that will change the way almost everything, from building materials to vaccines to computers, are designed and made. Neil Lane, the President's science advisor, says that this area of science and engineering will most likely lead to tomorrow's breakthroughs. It's a very important new area, but one where the practical applications are a few years away. Basic research is the key to pushing the envelope forward. 
   Yet despite the potential applications of these and other discoveries--and President Clinton's half-billion-dollar National Nanotechnology Initiative--recent trends do not bode well for the physical sciences. The Senate voted last year to double our investment in basic scientific research over the next decade, but the budget recently passed by this Congress places a higher priority on tax cuts and therefore will make such increases very difficult without forcing important cuts in other areas. Nevertheless, I hope that my colleagues understand that basic research is an appropriate role for government, and that such investment is clearly in the national interest. 
   To be sure, the R&D picture as a whole--public and private sectors combined--has been improving. R&D had reached a peak of nearly three percent of GDP in the early 1960s, and the number has recently risen close to its 1960s peak. But the overall federal investment in R&D is still relatively flat, because much of the recent gains have come from private industry. And as I already mentioned, much of that is in product development, rather than the most basic research. 
   If we look exclusively at the federal role in basic research, the numbers show the trend even more clearly. The federal R&D budget as a percent of GDP was nearly two percent in the mid 1960s, 
   and it is less than eight-tenths of one percent today. These declines have not been shared equally. Funding for the National Institutes of Health is much higher, and funding for the National Science Foundation is up slightly. But the other traditional big science agencies are significantly lower, with defense R&D cuts playing a central role. Defense R&D is down thirty percent over the past six years. 
   Again, some claim that this problem is overstated, because the private sector has picked up the slack. But there are two problems. First, with such a short time horizon for corporations, the private sector often looks to short-term projects like product development, rather than long-term projects with unsure real-world applications. This makes basic research more dependent on the federal government. 
   Second, public and private investment is only increasing in two areas, information technology and biotech/pharmaceuticals. Math, chemistry, geology, physics, and chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering are all declining. The United States risks falling behind in the area of innovation, as other nations such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Israel, and even Japan increase their investments in new ideas and new technologies. 
   The shift in federal R&D resources to health and biotech is a major reason we see so many talented people in the life sciences, but fewer and fewer mathematicians, chemists, physicists, and engineers. You could make a very strong argument that the stagnation in U.S. degrees in physical sciences and engineering is related to the decline of federal research dollars in these areas, because R&D funds not only science projects, but also the graduate students and researchers who will be tomorrow's scientists, technical workers, and teachers. 
   Consider the upcoming debate over increasing the number of H-1B visas, a special visa that allows foreign workers with special skills to work in the United States. Our national talent pool is being raided so heavily by the life sciences--in large part because the research money is there, meaning more opportunities for students--that the high tech industry desperately needs workers. By some estimates, hundreds of thousands of well-paying high-tech jobs remain unfilled because the U.S. talent pool is stretched so thin. While some in Congress--including myself--are willing to allow more H-1B workers if there is additional money for job training and science scholarships, we also know that job training alone is not the answer to the high-tech labor shortage. We must put more research money into the physical sciences so that more young people are attracted to these fields of work. 
   Another problem that we must deal with is entitlement reform. The constant growth of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare squeezes other areas of the budget and puts every program on the discretionary side in direct competition with each other. All discretionary programs, including research, are coming out of a smaller and smaller share of the pie. 
   The numbers here are telling. In the early 1960s, discretionary spending--where all of the research money comes from--was two-thirds of the budget, while mandatory spending and entitlements accounted for only one-third. Today, this is completely reversed, with discretionary spending now accounting for only one-third of all spending. Some estimates show that if we don't make changes soon, the entire budget could go to entitlements just a few decades from now. We must all recognize that future increases in science and research will suffer if entitlements are not reformed. 
   Michael Porter of Harvard University has done a great deal of research on what makes countries competitive in the global economy. He writes that continuous innovation is the key--but innovation requires research. For example, where will tomorrow's Internet come from? No one could have known that government's investment in this area would have such a huge impact on all of our lives. If we fail to shift our budgetary priorities to make investments in the future, we cannot promise our children an ever-growing economy. 
   In closing, I am encouraged that the Council on Competitiveness has recognized the importance of basic science research to our economic well-being. I hope that the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, will recognize that such investment is an appropriate role for government and is without question in the national interest, and that we will find ways to make the ``doubling bill'' a reality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000. I do so because I believe it affords us the best opportunity to deal with this problem in a way that will relieve this penalty from the vast majority of Americans. 
   Approximately 80 percent of the Americans who currently pay the marriage tax penalty would have their penalty eliminated entirely under our approach. 
   Secondly, I favor this approach because it allows us to deal with this problem in the most affordable manner, also giving us the freedom to address other important issues that have faced our great country. 
   I support the Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000 because it strikes the right balance between fiscal responsibility and a socially progressive policy, which I think is best for our country. 
   I support relief of the marriage tax penalty for several important reasons. First, as a matter of basic justice. It is not right that two individuals should pay more in taxes simply because they are married. When our Tax Code falls into ridicule, compliance drops and the Government, as a whole, falls into disrepute. We should not allow this to happen. We can take an important step to preventing this from happening by dealing with the marriage penalty problem. 
   Secondly, I support marriage tax penalty relief as a matter of social policy. Marriages and families are the basic building blocks on which our society is built. Too many marriages today end in disillusion. Too many families today are fractured because of the strains they face, often financial strains. If we can take action to strengthen families and marriages, to provide a sound and secure environment in which children can be raised, it is better for our country in a whole host of important ways. 
   I support the marriage tax relief provisions I speak to today as a matter of economic policy. During prosperous times when we enjoy surplus, it is only right that we share some of that hard-earned benefit with those who have generated it in the first place: the taxpayers of our country. 
   All of this is not to say we can afford just any approach to resolving the marriage penalty situation. We have to get it right. We have to do it in a way that is affordable and balanced with the other needs our country faces. This cannot be said of all the approaches currently before this body. Some of the approaches are poorly targeted, more than we can afford and, in fact, do not deserve the title of marriage tax penalty relief at all. 
   I admire the work done by the Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee; in particular, the leadership of the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, and Senator BAUCUS. Their approach is truly targeted to ending the marriage tax penalty problem. It is intellectually elegant, and I appreciate the work they have done in this regard. We have several practical issues we are working through, but their approach truly deserves the title ``marriage tax penalty relief.'' 
   The same cannot be said of the approach taken by the majority. Their approach claims to be a marriage tax penalty reduction bill but, as has been alluded to by several other speakers, more than half of the benefits go to those who do not have a marriage tax penalty at all. Many things can be said about this proposal. Calling it a marriage tax penalty bill is not one of them. 
   Secondly, it is too slow. It is phased in over a 7-year period. Why should we wait so long to give this important relief to the taxpayers of America? If it is truly a pressing problem, surely we can afford to act much sooner than that. 
   Third, it is regressive in nature. More than half of the benefits under the approach taken by the majority go to those earning more than $100,000 a year. 
   I have no trouble with the wealthy in our society. In fact, I wish we had more wealthy in the United States of America. But at a time when we have to make difficult decisions and allocate scarce resources among competing priorities, I 
    think relief of the marriage tax penalty needs to be more squarely focused upon the middle class, an approach not taken by the majority. 
   Finally, and most significant of all, is the issue of affordability. The approach taken by the majority would use fully $248 billion over the next 10 years to solve this problem, severely limiting our ability to deal with other pressing matters that face our country. 
   If you care about a drug benefit for Medicare, not only is the majority position silent about your concerns, it in fact limits our ability to do something about your concerns. If you care about making college more affordable by including a college tax deduction or credit to lower the cost of college, not only does the majority position do nothing to address your concerns, in fact it makes addressing your concerns and reducing the burden of the college expense on working families more difficult to accomplish. If you care about caring for the elderly, a sick parent or grandparent, not only is the majority approach silent about your concerns, it in fact makes it more difficult to deal with this important and pressing matter. If you care about debt relief or about education reform, not only is the majority position silent about your concerns, it in fact makes it more difficult to consider. 
   Fortunately, there is another alternative, one that is targeted, one that is immediate, one that is progressive, and one that is affordable. The approach I speak to today, as the approach taken by the Democrats in the Senate Finance Committee, is a true marriage tax penalty relief bill. No one who does not currently pay a marriage tax penalty will be eligible for a tax cut under this provision. It helps those who have the problem get relief, which is the way it should be. 
   Secondly, the relief is immediate. In the first year of this approach, fully 51  percent of Americans who pay a marriage tax penalty will have their marriage tax penalty eliminated entirely. After 4 years, when this approach is fully implemented, more than 80 percent of the American people, everyone making under $120,000 a year, will have their marriage tax penalty fully eliminated--100-percent elimination of the marriage tax penalty for everyone making $120,000 a year in just 4 years, not the 7 proposed by the majority. 
   Third, this approach is progressive. Everyone making under $120,000 will have the marriage tax penalty eliminated, and the majority, more than half, of the benefits go to those making between $50- and $100,000 a year. Working families, the middle class, those who are struggling most can make ends meet. 
   Finally, on the issue of affordability, while the majority proposes $248 billion over 10 years to deal with this problem, our approach would take only $90 billion--more than 80 percent of the problem eliminated at only a fraction of the cost--thereby freeing up billions and billions of dollars to deal with other pressing matters that face our society. 
   Let me put this in perspective: the difference in cost of the majority's position versus our position is $158 billion over 10 years. The difference in cost would completely fund a Medicare drug benefit proposed by the President of the United States for every senior citizen across our country qualifying for Medicare, helping to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Even if you don't adopt the President's approach to a Medicare drug benefit and instead adopt the less costly provisions 
    proposed by the majority--let's take the Republican drug benefit, costing around $70 billion over the next 10 years--you would still have the ability to fully fund that and, in addition, adopt a $10,000 tax deduction for people with children in college, allowing them to write off the first $10,000 of college tuition. 
   In addition, you would allow a $3,000 credit for senior citizens who are being cared for by their children or grandchildren, lowering the cost of long-term care for the elderly in our society. You would allow for the $30 billion of education reform proposed by Senator GRAHAM on the floor of the Senate just last year. 
   Let me briefly review the affordability provisions. On the one hand, you have a so-called marriage tax penalty relief bill that costs $248 billion over 10 years, the majority of which goes to people who, in fact, don't pay the marriage tax penalty, or you can eliminate 80 percent of the marriage tax penalty, eliminate it entirely for everyone making under $120,000 and, in addition to that, fully fund the Medicare drug benefit proposed by the majority, and fully fund the college tuition deduction proposed by Senator SCHUMER, and fully fund the long-term elderly care credit proposed by myself and others, and fully fund the money for education reform proposed by Senator GRAHAM. 
   The choice is clear: a marriage tax proposal on the one hand that goes to largely benefit those who don't pay the marriage tax penalty or a marriage penalty relief proposal that eliminates the vast majority of that problem and adds a Medicare drug proposal and makes college more affordable and provides for long-term care for the elderly and invests funds in the quality of education. I believe the choice is clear. 
   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and, again, commend the Senate Finance Committee Democrats for their dedication to this issue and the hard work they have devoted to it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues. I particularly express my appreciation to Senator GRAHAM, and my colleagues, Senators EDWARDS, LANDRIEU, LIEBERMAN, LINCOLN, and others, who are also speaking on the issue that has been near and dear to my heart for many years. It is the cause of improving the public education system in this country and the opportunity that we give to schoolchildren across the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, for more than 100 years, our Republic has been dedicated to the proposition that every child growing up in our country--every child, not just a few, not just the privileged and the elite--should have access to a quality public education. 
   In the 1960s, there was a growing recognition, particularly for those children in our country who are less fortunate, that the dream of a good education was a promise unfulfilled, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was born. 
   We gather here today to say that for too many of our young people the dream of a good education is still a promise unfulfilled, the status quo is not good enough, that we must do better, that we must have a significant rethinking and rededication to the principle that a good education is essential for opportunity and for every child growing up in our country. 
   That is what the Graham amendment is really all about. It begins with resources in the recognition that if we don't give our public schools the tools with which to get the job done, we can't possibly expect them to succeed. 
   The Graham amendment calls for setting aside an additional $15 billion in resources for reform and improvement in public education over the next 5 years. This is about one-tenth of the size of the tax cut included in the budget resolution before us. 
   While I favor cutting taxes, and in fact have sponsored and supported several of the measures that would reduce taxes in our country, I believe investing in education is just as important to the future well-being of this Nation. 
   I don't think a Member of the Senate can possibly say that cutting taxes is 10 times more important than putting quality public school teachers in every classroom in this country, or 10 times more important than ensuring that the latest educational technology is available to our students, or 10 times more important than ensuring that remedial help is available to our young people who need to do better reading, writing, and basic science. 
   Making these investments is vitally important to the important challenge of improving public education for every child. But Senator GRAHAM's approach does not just throw money at the problem. It deals with fundamental reform and starts with accountability and a  recognition that we need to focus not just upon how much money is spent but, instead, how much our children learn. 
   We need to focus on outcomes of the process, just as we add inputs necessary to achieving additional success. We need to also focus on high academic standards that are important to the success of all of our children. This is important because there is a growing gap between the haves and have-nots in our society, and there is just as much gap in knowledge and learning as in anything else. 
   We must ensure that every child gets good access to education and is held to these high educational standards to ensure that for the first time in the history of our Nation we don't experience the creation of an underclass characterized by people who do not have enough knowledge and learning to participate in the opportunities of the 21st century. 
   Just briefly, this approach is targeted on things that are important, such as adding good teachers, the latest technology, and focusing upon students who are at greatest risk, which is at the heart of the challenge we face as a country. 
   In closing, let me say this: The cause of educating our children is, by definition, the cause of shaping our future. But in doing so, we stay in touch with the fullest wellsprings of our past. It was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who, after his public career, founded the University of Virginia and dedicated his life to the cause of education, who once said that, ``a society that expects to be both ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been and never shall be.'' 
   As we debate this amendment, I urge my colleagues to support it because, in doing so, we not only ensure the future well-being of our economy, not only what kind of society we will one day have, but the vitality of our democracy itself. 
   I thank my colleagues for their forbearance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his indulgence. This is my first opportunity to point to the fact that Senator MOYNIHAN's mother was a longtime resident of our State. We are very proud of that fact, and I am pleased to note it today. Our colleague, Senator GREGG, is not with us, but I thank him for his leadership on this issue. It is not surprising to me that a former Governor is leading the way on a matter of such importance in terms of fiscal responsibility. Likewise, I commend our colleague, Senator KERREY. I am not the least bit surprised that someone whose courage has been tested on the field of battle also has the courage to address one of the foremost challenges of our time--a challenge that is important to the future of our country, yet escapes the ability of many politicians to address. I salute Senator KERREY for his leadership on this very important issue. 
   I, too, rise in support of the cause of repealing the earnings test limit on the Social Security benefits. It is the right thing to do at this time with unemployment being so low and the economy so strong. This will inject much needed talent on the part of senior workers into the economy. It is only right that if people are living longer, we should enable them to earn more to support themselves. Since it doesn't have a long-term fiscal impact, it is the right thing to do from that standpoint. 
   On this particular bill and on this particular vote, no profiles in courage will be written on the floor of the Senate 
   today. I am concerned and I add my voice to others--a growing chorus--in calling for meaningful reform in the Social Security system and to ensure its long-term financial viability. 
   The trends are disturbing. Over the last 40 years, the percentage of our Federal budget that has now gone to entitlement expenditures has doubled from about a third of Federal expenditures to two-thirds. Some projections are accurate. In the coming decades, fully 100 percent of Federal expenditures may be comprised of entitlements, leaving nothing left for things such as education, the environment, children's issues, health care, or national defense--literally nothing but entitlements, as important as they may be. 
   Clearly, this is a course that we cannot sustain forever. Likewise, I note that the percentage of Federal revenues raised through taxes funding entitlements has also doubled over the last 20 years, from 16 percent to fully one-third of Federal revenues now raised from payroll taxes. These taxes are regressive in nature and fall heavily and disproportionately on the middle class. 
   I believe in the importance of investment in education, science, research, and other important areas of our national budget, and it is because I believe in the importance of tax relief for the middle class that I believe very strongly we must embrace the cause of meaningful reform of entitlements in general, and particularly Social Security, if we are going to enable ourselves to meet these other important challenges as well. 
   This is something that should unite the right and the left. Those on the right should be concerned about a return to the days of debt and deficit spending and the corresponding slowdown in economic growth that would inevitably result. Those on the right should be concerned about an increasing percentage of our Federal budget basically being put on fiscal autopilot.  Those on the left should be concerned about shoring up and preserving not just temporarily, but in the long run, a fundamental part of our Social safety net, the Social Security system, a legacy of which we can rightfully be proud. And those on the left should also be concerned about maintaining the discretionary ability to invest in the other important things that will make our country a more prosperous and decent place in the years to come. 
   Despite this seeming ground for compromise between the left and right, too often a consensus evades us. It is difficult in a democracy to make hard choices. Yet our constituents have a right to expect no less from us. It takes wisdom and courage on the part of those proposing this reform, forbearance upon our political opponents' part, and ultimately wisdom and understanding on the part of the American people. 
   I wish to close my remarks by commending those who have risen to speak out in favor of the cause of meaningful entitlement reform. It is essential not only to preserving the benefits for those we claim to champion today; it is also important for proving the efficacy of our democratic institutions on the threshold of the 21st century. I thank my colleagues for their courage in taking up this issue. Senator KERREY's voice will be missed in the years to come. I hope to add mine in my own humble way, and ultimately we will achieve this objective. I thank Senator MOYNIHAN and yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of great importance and urgency to me. We are at a crossroads in American education and that is why I join with my colleagues Senators LIEBERMAN, LANDRIEU, KOHL, LINCOLN, BREAUX, GRAHAM, and ROBB in offering the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act. 
   Since the middle of the 1800s, when Horace Mann and a group of others dedicated our country to the principle that every child should have access to a good public education, we have held that out as an ideal for our country. In the middle 1960s, there was growing recognition that for too many of our children, this principle was really a hollow dream. And so, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was born. We introduce our version of ESEA today in recognition of the fact that for too many millions of American children the dream of a quality public education is still sorely lacking. 
   The consequences of any of our children not receiving a quality education are far greater than ever before. For the first time in our nation's history, the growing gap between the educational ``haves'' and ``have nots'' threatens to create a permanent underclass. If we do not address these shortcomings, the knowledge and information gap will lock many of our citizens out of the marketplace and prevent them from accessing opportunity in the New Economy. We stand here today in recognition of the fact that the solutions of the 1960s are inadequate to meet the challenges of the 21st Century and the years beyond. We stand here today to say the status quo is not good enough; that we must do better. 
   Our legislation proposes dramatic change in a significant rethinking of business as usual when it comes to education policy here in Washington, D.C. We propose a substantial increase in our nation's investment in education, because we recognize that we can't expect our schools, particularly our poorer schools, to get the job done if we don't give them the tools to get the job done. We propose an increase of $35 billion over five years in Federal education spending, a 50 percent increase for Title I funding, 90 percent increase for professional development funding for teachers, over a 30 percent increase for innovative programs, and nearly a doubling in funding for Charter schools and Magnet Schools so as to give parents greater public school choice. This is a significant investment of public dollars. 
   But we do more than just throw money at the problem, because we know that taxpayers, parents, and most of all our children, have a right to expect more from us. Instead, we focus on accountability. In return for increased investment, we insist upon results. We focus on outcomes, not incomes. No longer will we define success only in terms of how much money is spent, but instead of how much our children know. Can they read and write, add and subtract, know basic science? 
   No longer will we define accountability in terms of ordering local school districts to spend dollars in particular ways, but instead in terms of whether our children are getting the skills they need to make a successful life for themselves. This is a significant rethinking from the things that have prevailed here in Washington for several decades. 
   Our proposal also provides a substantial amount of flexibility. We don't agree with our colleagues on the far right in block grants which would allow money to be diverted from public education or to allow dollars to be diverted from focusing on our poorest students. But we do allow for local principals and superintendents to have a much greater say in determining how best to spend those dollars, because we believe that those at the local level who labor in the classrooms and the schools every day, can make those decisions far better than those of us who now work on the banks of the Potomac. 
   It was Thomas Jefferson who said that a society that expects to be both ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been and never shall be. So we put forward this proposal because we know that the cause of improving public education is critically important to our economy, critically important to the kind of society that we will be, and essential to the vibrancy of our democracy itself.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues today in introducing this timely and important legislation to help the nation respond to growing concerns about the threats to public health and the environment caused by methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. 
   There is gathering evidence that MTBE, which is added to gasoline to reduce its impact on air quality, poses a threat to human health and the environment. Preliminary testing indicates groundwater has been contaminated in many areas of the country. The MTBE Elimination Act provides for a three-year phase out of the use MTBE. The legislation also provides resources for research, local testing programs, and labeling so that we can identify the size of the problem and move forward with meaningful solutions. 
   Addressing the health and environmental threats posed by MTBE is only half of the answer. While we move to phase out MTBE, we also need to be making decisions about the future of the reformulated fuels program and the oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act. The Reformulated Gasoline Program has significantly reduced emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles, including volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and mobile-source air toxics, such as benzene. It is important that we evaluate the options available for maintaining and enhancing these benefits. 
   The first step is evaluating the obvious options, ethanol. In its assessment of oxygenate alternatives, the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel found that ethanol is ``an effective fuel-bending component, made from domestic grain and potentially from recycled biomass, that provides high octane, carbon monoxide emission benefits, and appears to contribute to the reduction of the use of aromatics with related toxics and other air quality benefits.'

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of my senior colleague, Senator RICHARD LUGAR, to honor a fellow Hoosier, Mr. Jack Butcher. Mr. President, as you know, the game of basketball is synonymous with the great state of Indiana. Our affection for the game goes much deeper than the sport itself. We love the game of basketball because of the values that it instills: spirit, teamwork, dedication, and most important, hard work. 
   We rise today to honor Coach Jack Butcher of Loogootee, Indiana, for his great success in the game of basketball, and for his outstanding service and contributions off the court. Coach Butcher has spent the last 43 years of his life coaching, teaching and influencing the young men and women of Loogootee High School. He has taught countless students lessons about hard work and dedication that one cannot learn from a book. 
   On December 28, 1999, Mr. Butcher achieved a remarkable milestone in Indiana basketball history, winning his 760th career game, and becoming the all-time winningest coach in Indiana high school basketball history. Mr. President, once again, Senator LUGAR and I would like to commend Coach Jack Butcher for his outstanding contributions both on and off the hardwood. His legacy will be permanently embedded in the record books and in the hearts and minds of the people of Loogootee.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, America is aging--we are all living longer and generally healthier and more productive lives. In the next 30 years, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double. For most Americans this is good news. However, for some families aging comes with unique financial obstacles. More and more middle income families are forced to choose between providing educational expenses for their children, saving for their own retirement, and providing medical care for their parents and grandparents. When a loved one becomes ill and needs to be cared for nothing is more challenging then deciding how the care they need should be provided. Today, I rise to make that decision easier and to strengthen one option for long-term care--caring for a loved one at home. 
   The bill I introduce today, the Care Assistance and Resource Enhancement Tax Credit, provides caregivers with a $3,000 tax credit for the services they provide. I am introducing this bill in order to encourage families to take care of their loved ones, make it more affordable for seniors to stay at home and receive the care they need, and save the government billions of dollars currently spent on institutional care. Through this tax credit we accomplish all that while emphasizing family values. 
   There are over 22 million people providing unpaid help with personal needs or household chores to a relative or friend who is at least 50 years old. In Indiana alone, there are 568,300 caregivers. They do this work without any compensation. They do not send the government a bill for their services or get reimbursed for their expenses by a private company. They do it because they care. As a result of their compassion, the government saves billions of dollars. For example, the average cost of a nursing home is $46,000 a year. The government spent approximately $32 billion in formal home health care costs and $83 billion in nursing home costs. If you add up all the private sector and government spending on long-term care it is dwarfed by the amount families spend caring for loved ones in their homes. As a study published by the Alzheimers Association indicated, caregivers provide $196 billion worth of care a year. 
   I held a field hearing in my state, Indiana, last August to discuss ways to make long-term care more affordable. At this hearing I heard from three caregivers who are providing care for a family member. Mrs. Linda McKinstry takes care of her husband who had been diagnosed with Alzheimers two years ago. Mr. and Mrs. Cahee are caregivers for Mr. Cahee's mother who also has Alzheimers. They all echoed the need for financial relief and support services. They spoke of the financial and emotional stress associated with taking care of a loved one. After hearing their stories, it became clear that their efforts are truly heroic and we should be doing all that we can at the federal level to provide the support they need to keep their families together. 
   At a time when people are becoming skeptical of the government, Congress needs to help people meet the challenges they face in their daily lives. This tax credit does that. It will serve 1.2 million older Americans, over 500,000 non-elderly adults, and approximately 250,000 children a year. I encourage you to take notice of the work done by caregivers and join me in supporting this legislation and giving caregivers the gratitude they deserve. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of increasing the minimum wage. I am aware that the bankruptcy reform bill that we recently passed in this chamber contains an amendment that will increase the minimum wage by $1 over a three-year period. While I voted for passage of the final bill, the minimum wage amendment it contained was constructed in a way that is sure to draw a Presidential veto, thereby endangering not only a wage increase for working families but also the months of work that all of us have put into reforming our bankruptcy laws. 
   The amendment that the bill contained was deeply flawed. I hope that the amendment will be stripped in conference so that we can send a bankruptcy reform bill to the President that he will sign. Then, perhaps we can move forward on a real increase in the minimum wage, perhaps in a package that contains some meaningful tax cuts for small business. 
   Madam President, we are living in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity. A few days ago, we reached an important milestone: We are now enjoying the longest economic expansion in our nation's history. Economic growth has been so strong that in 17 of the last 24 quarters, real GDP grew at a rate of three percent or more. Innovation, productivity, and fiscal discipline have all contributed to this expansion. Unemployment is at historic lows, real wages are increasing for many, and we have replaced welfare with work in record numbers. 
   But not everyone is realizing the prosperity many have enjoyed. While many workers in the economy have enjoyed sizeable raises, those workers at the bottom are still working hard just to make ends meet. Consider a minimum wage worker, working 40 hours a week. We want this worker to stay off of welfare, to be a responsible citizen and contribute to society, yet the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour allows this worker to earn just $10,700--nearly $3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. Add to this the fact that most of these workers receive no pension or paid vacation, few receive child care, and many lack employer-provided health insurance. There is no question that it is very difficult in our society to be a worker at the very bottom of the income scale. 
   It is important that we recognize the contributions that these workers make to our economy and our society, and that we act to ensure that the purchasing power of their income does not erode over time. Today's minimum wage is more than 20 percent lower in real terms than it was in 1979. The proposed increase to $6.15 simply restores the minimum wage back to its purchasing power in 1982. Would any of us deny that it's just as tough, or tougher, for a low-income family to make ends meet today as it was in 1982? 
   Raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour will directly help more than 11 million workers and their families, as well as the millions more earning between the current minimum of $5.15 and the new minimum of $6.15 who will also see their wages rise. It will reward the responsibility of these workers with a more living wage. It will send the message that we understand that being a member of the ``working poor'' is one of the toughest places to be in America, with obstacles to reaching the middle class turning up at every turn. Raising the minimum wage would reduce one such obstacle. Nearly 200,000 workers in Indiana would benefit directly from a minimum wage increase. 
   Some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to higher unemployment. I am happy to say that has not been the case in Indiana. Since September 1996, the last time the Senate passed a minimum wage increase, 133,000 new jobs have been created in my home state. Unemployment has dropped by 26 percent and now stands at 2.9 percent, significantly lower than the national average. 
   The good news in this debate is that it appears we all agree the minimum wage should be increased. We have our differences over the timing but by and large both Republicans and Democrats realize it is time to make work pay. 
   The bad news is that there is a poison pill buried in this legislation. At the same time that they seek to raise the take home pay of working families, the Republican minimum wage proposal contains a provision that could reduce the wages of approximately 73 million American workers who are eligible to receive overtime pay. 
   This overtime pay repeal provision would allow employers to eliminate the requirement that bonuses, commissions, and other forms of compensation based on productivity, quality and efficiency be part of a worker's ``regular rate'' of pay for purposes of calculating overtime pay. Eliminating this provision, and allowing bonuses to be excluded from overtime pay, would nullify the purposes for which the Fair Labor Standards Act was created. Employers would be provided an incentive to slash hourly pay rates or reduce the number of new jobs they create. Such cynical actions explain why so many Americans are frustrated with politics. 
   Raising the minimum wage is something that most Americans regard as fair, given our economic prosperity, and 75 to 80 percent support an increase in every opinion poll. Yet some refuse  to act in a way that genuinely responds to this concern. What's more, the bill in its current form will almost certainly provoke a presidential veto. 
   Madam President, we have been down this road before. Both sides agree on an issue that needs to be addressed and then allow a partisan squabble to prevent us from getting it done. The American people did not send us here to spend all of our time arguing over our differences. They sent us here--and I came here--to find the common ground on which we agree. 
   Now that the bankruptcy reform bill has passed the Senate, I urge my colleagues to work these issues out in conference. Let's begin the year focused not on what divides us but what unites us in the interests of America's working families. 
   Madam President, I want to also take a moment to discuss the Hatch Amendment that is now part of this legislation. While I believe that the methamphetamine provisions of this amendment are good and something I could support, I voted against this amendment last year for I do not support the voucher language contained in this amendment. I do not support diverting needed resources from our public schools for voucher proposals. Deserting our public schools is not the answer to the problem. I believe we need greater flexibility and greater accountability in our nation's schools. This voucher language is of great concern to me. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will do the right thing and remove the voucher language from this bill during conference.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as the author of the International Year of the Older Persons resolution to recognize the contributions of all the individuals, organizations and agencies that have worked hard to participate in the United Nations declared ``International Year of the Older Persons.'' Since 1999 has been declared the Year of the Older Persons, around the world seniors, organizations active in senior issues, and representatives of all generations have spread the message that collectively we should create an environment in which seniors can remain active in their communities during each and every stage of their life. This resolution pays tribute to all the United States' participants for representing our country in the various events held in celebration of the International Year of the Older Persons. They have been active throughout the year. It is time Congress added its voice and support the efforts of these organizations and individuals. This resolution serves as a first step in the role Congress can play to assist with the advancement of this year's theme and goals. 
   The theme of the year, a ``society for all ages,'' recognizes that longevity is relevant to all stages of the life cycle, and that successful aging is a product of long-term planning, lifelong decisions. It is important for the world to reflect upon this theme. Too often in America we focus on the negative images associated with aging and not the contributions that are made when people remain productive throughout their lifetime. America needs to celebrate that Americans are living longer! We need to acknowledge that aging can be a positive process that benefits everyone in our communities. 
   The most important goals of the year are to increase awareness about aging within countries and across national boundaries and to formulate policies and programs to promote the well-being of older persons. The principles highlighted by the resolution include independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity. The purpose of the year is to empower people to spend their senior years happy and healthy. Although the goals and principles of this year have been advanced internationally, we need to particularly acknowledge that the United States has been well represented by several organizations such as the Federal Committee to Prepare for the International Year of Older Persons, the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, and the American Association for International Aging. 
   While America's senior organizations have been deeply involved, it is my hope is this resolution will serve as a signal that it is important for Congress to take the goals set forth this year and continue the efforts to achieve them. Congress should take the leadership the United Nations has provided on this issue and continue to build momentum. We need to not only recognize and assist those spreading the message but implement legislation that actively addresses the needs of seniors. As a member of the Special Committee on Aging, I have learned about the issues that seniors face and have explored viable administrative and legislative solutions. 
   I know America needs to be better prepared for its future aging population. Currently, about 12.8 million Americans report needing long-term care. By 2018, it is estimated that there will be 3.6 million elderly persons in need of a nursing home bed, an increase of two million from the current future. By 2030, the number of Americans in nursing homes will double and the cost of caring for them will quadruple. Part of creating a society for all ages includes addressing the needs of all ages. 
   Long-term care insurance is an option that should be more widely discussed among younger people as they begin to prepare for their retirement or senior years. However, often we need raise awareness and encourage people to take responsibility. That is why I support a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance. In addition, with an increasing number of people needing long-term care, we should make various options for long-term care more available and affordable. 
   While long-term care insurance for community-based care is one option, being cared for by a loved one at home should be another option. Therefore, in August, I introduced S. 1518, the Caregivers Assistance and Resources Enhancement (CARE) tax credit. It takes courage and dedication to take care of  a loved one at home and the least we can do is make the process less financially burdensome. Research indicates that the services provided by family caregivers annually are valued at $196 billion. The care these families provide at home is not only more compassionate, it saves the government billions of dollars. Annually, we spend $83 billion in nursing home care and $32 billion in formal home health care, we should thank caregivers by providing them with some economic relief. 
   There is still a great deal of work that can be done to take care of current seniors and prepare for the future. We need to have the difficult discussions and search for the solutions. 
   I want to thank Senator GRASSLEY and Senator BREAUX for their support and involvement on this resolution and for their leadership on the Special Committee on Aging. 
   I commend all the organizations and individuals who have worked so hard throughout the year to help spread the message associated with the International Year of the Older Persons. As America works the remainder of this year and in the years to come to achieve the goals set forth by the International Year of the Older Persons, we need to seriously consider what we in Congress can do to create a society for all ages.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, For years the American people have become increasingly cynical about our federal government and apathetic about political participation. There are many reasons for this unfortunate state of affairs. This year's budget exemplifies several. 
   One reason is our inability to do what every family and business must do, balance our budget. After years of large, chronic deficits, last year we finally, if barely, balanced the federal budget. If great care is not taken, the budget will not be balanced for long. 
   Another reason is Washington's unwillingness to be honest with the American people. This budget is only the latest example. Proponents claim it is balanced. It is not. They say it does not raid social security, but it does. It purports to meet certain ``emergencies'', when no reasonable person could possibly consider them such. It's time we ended this ``business as usual'' in Washington and began to regain the trust of the American people. 
   I oppose this bill because it spends too much and uses gimmicks that will make future budgets even more difficult. It ignores the greatest financial challenge facing our nation, entitlement reform, and makes matters even worse by taking money from the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for spending today. It foreshadows a return of  chronic deficits. If we must resort to such foolishness when times are good, what will happen when times are tough? It makes the prospect of meaningful tax cuts much more remote because it spends the surplus and then some. 
   There are circumstances that could justify my support for this budget and some of the items that I object to. But none exist now. If meaningful entitlement reform had been included. If the economy were weak and the gimmicks were only temporary expedients, not the permanent fixtures they promise to be. If we had a few more years, not just one, of balanced budgets under our belt. There are several good things in this budget, things I strongly support: funding for 100,000 additional teachers in our classrooms, putting 50,000 additional police officers on our streets, relief for hospitals and other providers from excessive Medicare cuts, enhanced Land and Water Conservation funds, expanded biomedical research through NIH, expanded Head Start and increased After School Care. 
   All of these have merit. All should be done. But we must have the honesty and integrity to pay for them, or the restraint to wait until we can, and not just perpetuate the cynicism created by annual budget charades. 
   I look forward to voting for a future budget. One that preserves and strengthens the foundation of financial security so important to our nation's well-being. Even more, I look forward to that day when this Congress enjoys the respect and admiration of our fellow citizens. This budget will not hasten that day.

   Mr. BAYH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator SARBANES. 
   Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support in favor of the Financial Services Modernization Act. I do so because of my heartfelt conviction that it will be good for the American economy, it will be good for the financial services sector of the economy, and it will also be good for consumers and the American people for many years to come. 
   I will begin by expressing my gratitude and respect for the leaders who have brought us here today after so many years. Senator GRAMM has performed admirably in getting this accomplished after so many years in the past it has failed. I salute him and commend him for his efforts. 
   Quite frankly, there were some questions about the new chairman when he assumed this position: Would he be willing to make reasonable compromises necessary to get the bill passed? Would he take a broader view or be the captive of narrow parochial interests? Would he be flexible? All these questions, I am proud to say, have been answered in the affirmative. 
   I wish to salute my colleague, Senator GRAMM, for this historic accomplishment. Without his leadership, we would not be here today. It is a masterful bit of work. And I am proud of his accomplishment in this regard. 
   I also wish to salute my colleague, Senator SARBANES. Also, we would not be here today without his leadership. He has proven to be a tireless advocate and effective spokesperson for those who are less fortunate. He has proven to be a tireless worker in favor of the rights of privacy of America's consumers. We would not have a bill before the Senate today that could pass this body, that the President would sign, or, frankly, one that enjoyed wide support were it not for the tireless efforts of Senator SARBANES. I compliment him as well. He has been a copartner in this historic accomplishment which we recognize today. 
   This legislation is good for the American economy. The era of global competitiveness in the financial services sector is unquestionably an area in which our Nation is preeminent. The world looks to the United States to lead the way in areas such as banking, insurance, securities, and investment banking. 
   Financial services contribute annually to a trade surplus for the United States of America at a time when our trade deficit is running into the hundreds of billions of dollars. But we cannot take our current preeminence for granted. I have had some experience in this regard. 
   My colleagues may not know that Indiana was one of the very last States to adopt not interstate banking but across-State-line banking in the mid-1980s. As a result of the fact we didn't modernize our laws, once the walls came tumbling down, as they inevitably do, almost all of Indiana's financial institutions in the banking sector were gobbled up by institutions from other States. 
   If we were similarly to hamstring America's financial institutions--banking, insurance, and securities--with antiquated laws that kept them from having the flexibility needed to compete with our foreign competitors, the day might 
   not be too far removed when those from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and other nations would be gobbling up our financial institutions because they were too weak or incapable of competing. We shouldn't let that happen to our country. 
   Hundreds of thousands of jobs across our country and tens of thousands of jobs in Indiana depend upon us getting this done. I am proud to say that we  will. It is good for America's economy. It is also good for the broader economy. 
   Manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors depend upon access to a vital growing financial services sector. Access to capital is one of the key ingredients for financial success today. Because of this bill, greater efficiency in providing funds for expansion will exist, leading to greater investment, greater productivity, and a rising standard of living for America's working men and women. Access to capital is one of the key ingredients to success in the economy today. This legislation will ensure that the funds keep flowing from America's economy, making it more productive and more efficient for American workers and American shareholders alike. 
   This legislation is good for consumers. Not only will it be convenient, providing one-stop shopping for working men and women across our country, where they go to a single place and meet their banking needs, insurance needs, security investment needs, and others, but it will also lead to greater efficiency, lower interest rates, and greater access to credit. It will also lead to greater innovation in the new marketplace with greater competition. 
   I foresee a day not too far removed when services that we can barely imagine today will be provided more conveniently and efficiently to Americans across our country. 
   Frankly, I approach this bill with some reservations as well. Some issues needed to be resolved or I would not be standing here today to express my strong support for this legislation. Foremost among these was the Community Reinvestment Act, an act that is necessary to guaranteeing access to capital for Americans of every walk of life, regardless of race, creed, or color. 
   As I said when I previously took the floor to speak on this issue, access to capital today is as important as access to electricity was in the 1930s or access to a telephone was in the 1950s or 1960s. I recognize that issue has been positively resolved in the course of our negotiations. 
   Second, the emerging issue of privacy is very important. I share the concerns of many Americans about what will happen to their most sensitive information in the new global marketplace. 
   I am pleased to say that we have taken the first steps in this legislation to guarantee greater privacy for American consumers by requiring clear and plain disclosure about what information will be used within a company, and also allowing American consumers the right to opt out and prohibit companies that they do business with from sharing their financial information with third parties. 
   This is an issue we have only begun to recognize. We must continue to follow it in the days to come. If it should be the case that greater protections are necessary, I will be one of those who will help to lead the way and look forward to leading the way to ensuring that. For the time being, I am pleased with the provisions currently in the bill and am proud to say we are taking a significant step forward. 
   In conclusion, for 20 years, we have been 
   laboring to modernize the law that governs financial services that was first enacted in the 1930s. A long string of people who have preceded us in this body have attempted this and have not been successful. But thanks to the leadership of Senator GRAMM and the leadership of Senator SARBANES, the ability of all involved to come together and compromise for the well being of the American economy, the American consumer, and the future of our country, today we celebrate the historic accomplishment. 
   I intend to vote for this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Again, I congratulate all who have brought us to this important accomplishment. 
   Thank you. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as an original cosponsor of the Child Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999. This bill will provide states, such as Indiana with additional time to either obtain a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services or comply with the state disbursement unit requirement without being penalized. It is important that states are provided with sufficient time to determine what system will allow them to collect and disburse child support payments most efficiently. 
   For many states the most economical and administratively efficient means of delivering and collecting child support payments is to comply with the requirement and create a central state disbursement unit. However, the Department of Health and Human Services has recognized some exceptions to that general rule and granted those states a waiver. The State of Indiana has applied for a waiver but is awaiting the Secretary's determination of whether or not to grant the waiver request. This legislation will allow Indiana, and the other states in a similar predicament, the time they need to determine what system works best for them. In addition, the penalty these states face will be reduced. States will not be in jeopardy of losing all of their administrative dollars for child support collection. 
   Without this legislation, the State of Indiana could lose as much as $33.5 million, undermining the state's ability to collect child support. While child support collection affects the budgets of the Federal and State Governments, it most importantly affects the children for whom it is intended. The system was designed so children would at least have the economic support of both their parents. 
   It is important that Congress continue to find ways to collect child support owed to children from noncustodial parents. Child support administrative dollars help states accomplish that goal. 
   There are other steps Congress can take to reconnect noncustodial parents with their children and encourage them to pay child support. As we continue to discuss the intricacies of child support collection, the need for a child to have the emotional and financial support of both parents should be incorporated into the discussion. I look forward to having that discussion in the near future. 
   I thank Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their leadership on this issue and for acknowledging the need to provide states with more time to implement a child support collection and disbursement system that works. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, as November has been designated Native American History Month, I am honored to congratulate a museum in my own state for its efforts to recognize Native American artists and encourage the creation of new Native American fine art. The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art recently launched an unprecedented 10-year program to strengthen the recognition and study of Native American artists who are making a valuable contribution to our nation's fine arts. The long-term goal of the program is to create a national alliance of scholars, curators, artists, teachers, and collectors who would further the notice and study given to Native American fine artists. 
   Under the leadership of John Vanausdall, the museum's president and CEO, an international jury of scholars was appointed to select the first year's fellows and master artist from 106 qualified nominees. Jurors included: Gerald R. McMaster (Plains Cree), curator of contemporary Indian art at the Canadian Museum of Civilization; Bruce Bernstein, assistant director for cultural resources at the National Museum of the American Indian; and Kay WalkingStick (Cherokee), artist and professor of fine art at Cornell University. 
   On November 13, the first five recipients of the Eiteljorg Fellowship of Native American Fine Art will travel to the Eiteljorg Museum where they will receive national acclaim. They will each be presented with a fellowship award of $20,000 and participate in the opening events for an exhibition of their art. I am pleased to announce the inaugural winners: Lorenzo R. Clayton (Navajo), Truman Lowe (Ho Chunk), Marianne Nicolson (Kwakwaka'wakw), Rick Rivet (M&#233;tis/Dene), and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith (Flathead). In addition, George Morrison (Chippewa) was named a master artist. I urge Americans to visit the exhibition which will be on view at the Eiteljorg Museum, located in the beautiful White River State Park in Indianapolis from November 13, 1999 through January 23, 2000. 
   I commend the Eiteljorg Museum for conceiving this long-overdue honor to Native American artists. This wonderful program is due to the generosity of the Indianapolis-based Lilly Foundation, Inc. which has directed $490,000 to this worthy endeavor. Thanks to the efforts of the Eiteljorg Museum and Lilly, the future is bright for Native American artists, as this program will award $100,000 to five artists every two years. Our state is fortunate for their vision and I am honored to recognize their efforts in promoting Native American Art and preserving the culture of Native Americans.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, this week, with the passing of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, we lost a dear colleague and a friend. John Chafee was a real statesman. His passing is a tragedy, and a loss for America. 
   As a new member of this body, I regret that my time serving with Senator Chafee was brief. Fortunately, the lessons I learned from working with him will last a lifetime. Senator Chafee was an all-too-rare voice for bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate. He was a force for common sense, and someone who always put politics aside and tried to do what was right for America.  
   For those of us who value consensus over partisan politics, Senator Chafee's approach to service will remain the standard we strive towards. His central goal, he said, was to ``operate through consensus and cooperation wherever and whenever possible in order to get things done.'' 
   And ``get things done'' he did: after what for most men would be a full and distinguished life in public service--World War II duty, company commander in Korea, Minority Leader in the Rhode Island State House, three-term Governor, Secretary of the U.S. Navy--after all that, John Chafee began his service in the U.S. Senate. 
   In twenty-two years as U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, John Chafee's most remarkable accomplishments came when he managed to bring others to the middle-ground on contentious issues such as budget and tax policy, environmental protection, and health care. 
   Senator Chafee understood the responsibility we shoulder here when we write a budget for the nation, and he had the vision to act responsibly on behalf of future generations. He was a leader in efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit. In 1996 he co-chaired the Centrist Coalition which produced a bipartisan balanced budget plan. More recently, as Democrats and Republicans fought bitterly over their respective $300 billion and $800 billion tax-cut proposals, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Chafee as part of a bipartisan group fighting to pass a reasonable $500 billion tax cut. For me, working with Senator Chafee reinforced the value of his consensus-building approach, and my desire to emulate that approach. 
   Senator Chafee was a longtime advocate for clean air and water, wetlands conservation, and open space preservation. As a result of his dedication to preserving our natural heritage, Senator Chafee was the recipient of every major environmental award. 
   As a senior member of the Finance Committee, Senator Chafee worked successfully to expand health care coverage for women and children, and to improve community services for persons with disabilities. 
   John Chafee served his country for many years and in many roles. Perhaps his most important legacy is the way he served America: ``operating through consensus and cooperation wherever and whenever possible in order to get things done.'' 
   We're all going to miss him very much.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I begin my brief comments this afternoon by complimenting our colleagues, Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, for a fine piece of work on this legislation under what were less than ideal circumstances, I am sure. I know they have labored long and hard to craft a bill that will meet the needs of our fellow constituents across the country. I, for one, appreciate their labors. 
   I rise in the spirit of making this product even better. In particular, I rise in support of what I understand will be an amendment offered by Senator KERRY in the area of section 8 housing. I do so not only because I believe the merits of his amendment warrant our support, but also because I believe the American dream of quality affordable housing should be extended to every citizen across our country because I believe in the emphasis that we have been placing upon personal responsibility. Along with that must go the tools to ensure that every person has a chance to make personal responsibility become successful, and no one can deny that quality affordable housing is one of those basic building blocks of opportunity in our society. 
   Finally, I rise in support of this prospective amendment because I believe in fiscally responsible solutions to the challenges that face America. Few can argue that quality affordable housing is a challenge that continues to face our great country. 
   For well nigh a generation, there was a bipartisan consensus across our land for quality affordable housing for all Americans. This consensus was interrupted in 1995, when additional section 8 housing opportunities were frozen in place after more than 2 million Americans had been helped over the previous 18 years. Starting this fiscal year, we began to see a thaw in the freeze, but unfortunately the legislation now before this body would reinstitute that freeze. It is ironic that at a time of unparalleled prosperity for so many Americans we should see a freezing of the opportunities in the area of affordable housing. While 1 million elderly are finding themselves in a position where more than 50 percent of their disposable income is spent on rent or substandard housing, 2 million families with children find themselves in this position. More than 22,000 Hoosier families in my capital city of Indianapolis alone find themselves in a position of devoting a majority of their household income to rent or to substandard housing. 
   As we gather, 1 million Americans find themselves on waiting lists. The question before us is, How long must they wait. In some cities--Philadelphia, Los Angeles and others--families find themselves in a position of waiting for years, waiting with dreams deferred, hopes delayed, opportunities lost, this at a time when our robust economy and market conditions are driving rents up, pricing too many American families out of the market for quality affordable housing. 
   My answer to the question of how long they must wait is that the time is now to act. The time is now to act to extend the opportunity of quality affordable housing to every corner of the land, to prevent this from becoming the first generation of Americans to be divided into classes of haves and have-nots. Now is the time to put flesh on the bones of personal responsibility, to ensure every family that is willing to work hard, play by the rules and save has a chance to get ahead and realize the American dream of quality affordable housing. 
   Now is also the time to put into place fiscally responsible solutions to the challenges that face our great land. This proposed amendment by Senator KERRY is fiscally responsible. We will be taking money that was saved from this year's budget in unused welfare-to-work vouchers and using it for 50,000 new section 8 vouchers, which are also important for making the welfare-to-work process a success. 
   I add my voice as strongly as I know how to Senator KERRY, to the Secretary of Housing, to Senator MIKULSKI, and my other colleagues who believe if we are to be a great nation, and not just a prosperous one but a compassionate one, we must address the unmet needs of housing for those who are less fortunate across our land. I conclude my remarks by saying: If not now, when our land is filled with plenty, then when? 
   I urge the adoption of this amendment. Again, I thank Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for their yeoman's work. I think we can make a good bill even better by adopting this amendment. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great pride in becoming a founding member of the newly-formed Senate Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus. The protection of public lands is critical to the preservation of our national heritage, the protection of our environmental health and the endurance of the American tradition of respect for natural resources. 
   In September of 1964, the Wilderness Protection Act was passed. It was a landmark in public land protection, establishing that some lands managed by the federal government should be preserved as wilderness for the benefit of all Americans. My father was among the Senators who worked to pass that legislation. 
   Today, wilderness areas are under even greater pressure from increasing development and expansion. As Governor of Indiana, I worked to protect state lands by establishing the Indiana Heritage Trust, which preserved sensitive areas with the proceeds from sales of environmental license plates. That initiative resulted in the protection of more than 5000 acres of threatened lands. 
   I am proud to join my colleagues in the Senate in starting the Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus and carrying forward the tradition of stewardship of federal lands reflected in the Wilderness Act of 1964. I would like to thank Senator FEINGOLD in particular for his leadership and dedication to this issue. 
   We have the obligation and the opportunity to protect the natural heritage that belongs to all Americans. The Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus will be an important asset in pursuing that goal by providing support and education regarding federal land management and wilderness areas.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, thank you. 
   I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate as a part of a bipartisan group once again--this time to advocate a tax cut for the American people that is fiscally responsible, that honors our values, and that can actually be done. 
   I am disappointed we will not have an opportunity to vote on this proposal today because I believe it is in the best interests of the American people. Ultimately, I believe that if we are going to ever span the partisan chasm that stretches before us, it will be on the ground that I and others are staking out here today. 
   This proposal is fiscally responsible. It allows for paying down 94 percent of the publicly held Federal debt--94 percent of the publicly held Federal debt. That is fiscally responsible. It, as the other proposals would do, extends the life of Social Security to the year 2053--54 more years--by adding $1.8 trillion to Social Security. That, too, is fiscally responsible. It extends the life of Medicare to the year 2020, adding $210 billion--allowing for that to extend the life of Medicare. 
   As my colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, pointed out, on some occasions none of the proposals that are before us permanently solve every issue of Medicare. All of them simply postpone the day of reckoning. Our proposal would do that and give us time for systemic reform. But, in the meantime, adding $210 billion to extend the life of Medicare is the fiscally responsible thing to do. 
   Finally, it allows for $500 billion of tax reductions for the men and women of our country, completely removing from the tax rolls 3 million hard-working Americans and moving 4 million people from the 28-percent tax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket. 
   I have listened to the eloquence of my colleagues, many of whom have mentioned the important needs of our Government--and our Government does have important needs--many of whom have mentioned the funding priorities for Government spending programs which are important. 
   I remind all of us about the needs of the American people, of families, working men and women. What about their needs too? Many working families across my State, even in this time of plenty with a strong economy, are having trouble paying the mortgage, putting something away for retirement, affording a college education for their children. These families--at a time when we are adding $1.8 trillion to Social Security, $210 billion for Medicare, and the other for discretionary spending--can very much use the $1,000 for an average family across my State to help meet their pressing needs. It is the right and appropriate thing to do. 
   This proposal honors our values--our most basic values--and eliminates entirely the marriage penalty. No longer will people be penalized by the Federal Tax Code simply because they choose to get married. We should encourage marriage. We should not discourage marriage. 
   This proposal makes child care, care for a sick parent, and health insurance for those who are without it more affordable. These are the right things to do. 
   I think it is important to recognize that we can cherish our values and promote them by reducing taxes just as easily and sometimes better than through increased public spending. 
   This proposal has room for a $45 billion drug benefit under Medicare, the same amount of public spending required of the President's proposal, and still we would have $180 billion for additional discretionary spending over the next 10 years. 
   There has been a lot of talk and a good deal of disagreement about the appropriate level for discretionary spending increases. I must say, with all due respect, I cannot agree with my colleagues in the majority because I find the assumptions and accounting upon which their proposal is based are suspect at best. They ask us to believe they can hold to spending caps over the next 10 years that they have already admitted they cannot abide by in this very year. That simply is not possible. Yesterday I listened to one of my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee have an amazing colloquy with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in which he essentially said, Mr. Chairman, the reason I am supporting tax reductions is that I cannot keep from spending irresponsibly. He looked at the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and almost asked him: Mr. Chairman, stop me before I spend again. 
   Colleagues, we have been elected to this body to make tough choices and set priorities. I believe we can and should. The prescription of the majority is one for increased debt and deficit. This is a path I choose not to travel. At the same time, I cannot find myself in agreement with those who show charts and list figures basically arguing for an inflationary increase for Federal spending as far as the eye can see, basically putting Federal spending on autopilot. I do not know of any working family in my State who has been guaranteed inflationary increases in their family income for 10 years. Why should we treat the Federal Government any better than ordinary citizens? Of course we should not. 
   I asked the Chairman of the Federal Reserve yesterday about productivity increases. We are seeing amazing productivity increases in the private economy. Shouldn't the Government be asked to become more efficient and productive as well, thereby decreasing the need for annual increases in spending? Of course we need to set priorities and make difficult decisions, allowing us to live within our means, just as families across my State and country are asked to live within their means. 
   This is a momentous debate. The consequences of our decisions will last for many years to come. I believe we have set the right balance of priorities, fiscal responsibility, honoring our values, doing right by future generations in a bipartisan way. I appeal to the President and my colleagues for support for this measure. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Alabama, Senator SHELBY, to introduce the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. This important legislation is designed to ensure that the manufactured housing industry continues to provide safe, affordable housing by modernizing the requirements under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. The bill also provides the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with the resources necessary to meet its obligations to manufactured homeowners. 
   Manufactured housing has evolved significantly in the last twenty-five years; it's no longer the stereotypical mobile home. In fact, the vast majority of manufactured homes installed today are never moved once they have been sited. At an average cost of $40,000 for a new manufactured home, excluding land, manufactured housing is the fastest growing sector of the housing industry. One in every four new single family homes sold in the United States is a manufactured home. Manufactured housing provides many American families with the opportunity to not only own their own homes, but to live in safe, comfortable, and affordable housing. In addition, improvements in construction have led to the development of aesthetically pleasing homes. Most manufactured homes built today are manufactured to resemble traditional site built homes and are enjoyed by an array of Americans, including first time home buyers, senior citizens, and single parent families. Manufactured housing is an industry that not only provides affordable housing but also creates jobs. In my home state of Indiana, the manufactured housing industry employees more than 20,000 Hoosiers and has a total economic impact in my state of nearly $3 billion per year. 
   The Manufactured Housing Program at HUD, which oversees the industry, has faced many administrative challenges in the last decade. Lack of resources has prevented the program from keeping up with the changing needs of manufactured housing. While the industry has voluntary implemented numerous code changes in recent years, many requests to review standards or regulations currently await action by HUD or have taken numerous years to process, because of inadequate resources at the Department. Ten years ago, the number of HUD employees assigned to this program was 34. Today, only 8 HUD employees are responsible for this program. With the rapid growth in housing technology, it is imperative that HUD not only address these standards but do so in a timely fashion, allowing the industry to remain competitive while providing homeowners with the most advanced housing technology. 
   Our legislation will remedy this situation by modernizing the program by implementing procedures in which all proposed construction and safety standards are addressed and considered in a reasonable time frame. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act requires that action on any proposed standard or regulation be taken within one year after it has been proposed to the Secretary. This is an important provision. It requires the Secretary to act, but protects consumers by authorizing the Secretary to reject any proposal which is deemed to be adverse to consumers. 
   Finally, through the use of industry labeling fees, this legislation provides economic resources to the Secretary for the hiring of additional HUD program staff. The costs of operating this program and the re-staffing of the manufactured housing program will continue to be borne by the manufactured housing industry, not the taxpayer. I note that the industry is willing to bear this expense in order to improve the efficiency of the regulatory system. 
   As we strive to ensure that all Americans have access to safe, affordable, and quality housing, we need to ensure that best practices are applied to the housing industry and that we support the modernization of housing technology. Manufactured housing is a valuable housing resource and provides access to home ownership for many Americans. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation.

   Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I am pleased to be here, and I rise in opposition to Senate Resolution 160 because I believe that it represents bad public policy. It represents a lack of conviction and consistency on the part of the majority in this Chamber, and it represents a continuing erosion of the traditions of this great body which imperil the very vitality of our democracy. 
   I say these things, although I have no doubt that if we asked many who are in the galleries today or the citizens in my State exactly what rule XVI involves, they would have very little awareness of this or of the significance of the change that has been proposed. I do believe that if the citizens of our country understood the importance, the symbolic changes this resolution represents, they would be concerned, indeed, because the citizens of our country do care about good public policy. 
   The best avenue to ensuring that the people of our country have good public policy, with the fostering of vigorous, open debate, is the contest of ideas right here in the well of the Senate, where the good ideas triumph and the bad ones are weeded out. 
   Someone said, the best disinfectant is sunshine. That holds true in the Senate as it does in other forums. We will not get the best Government that the people of our country deserve if the minority in this Chamber is not given the privilege of introducing our ideas before the American people and debating them in a free and open forum. 
   Think with me for a moment of some of the ideas that would not have been allowed to come up over the last 6 months that I have been privileged to serve in the Senate if this resolution proposed before us today were adopted. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is important to every citizen across our country. Mr. President, if you believe in the right to have access to a specialist, in emergency care, you should care about this resolution. If you believe in the right to have an effective appeal to the denial of coverage, you should support defeat of this resolution. 
   Likewise, the juvenile justice bill, which we addressed in the tragic aftermath of the Columbine incident, would never have come before this Chamber if this resolution that we consider today were in effect. 
   Something I worked very hard on, with a bipartisan group, to ensure that the States have access to the proceeds from the tobacco litigation, would never have come before this Chamber and would not have been a part of the emergency supplemental passed into law if this resolution we consider today had been in effect. 
   Important issues of public policy, my fellow Americans, would not be heard on the floor of this great body, the greatest deliberative body in the history of man, if the resolution proposed before us goes into effect. 
   Your well-being, the well-being of our country, and those about whom we care will be substantially affected if this resolution is adopted. We should not let that happen to future debates about education or the minimum wage or other things that we, as Americans, care about. 
   Likewise, Mr. President, I am distressed to state it, but I believe this resolution represents a very real lack of conviction, a lack of conviction on the part of the majority now controlling this Chamber. If they truly have the best ideas, if their ideas are in the best interests of the American people, why not have them subjected to amendment and debate on the floor of the Senate? 
   Moreover, I ask those here in our presence today, and those viewing us at home, if our ideas on this side of the Chamber are so weak, so lacking in merit, what is the fear in allowing us to debate them and vote on them in the Senate? 
   My friends, I think the answer is distressingly clear. There are some Members of this body who do not want to cast the tough votes. They do not want to be forced to make the tough decisions. They do not want to have to address the compelling challenges of our time. They would rather limit debate and too often gag the Members of the minority from presenting our ideas. 
   The answer to this, Mr. President, is simple: It is not to stifle debate, it is  not to prevent votes. If you do not believe in having a vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate, why run for the office in the first place? 
   As Harry Truman once said: If you can't stand the heat, you better not go into the kitchen. That is what this resolution is really all about. 
   Next, this resolution, unfortunately, represents a real lack of consistency on the part of the majority. It is a flip-flop, more worthy of a gymnastics contest than a debate on the floor of the Senate. 
   Just 4 short years ago, the majority voted to overturn the historic practice of not allowing legislation on appropriations. Now they propose to change it back. I could not blame Americans listening to our comments today if they thought what was really holding sway on the floor of the Senate had more to do with expediency in politics than consistency of principle. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, it represents something that Americans have come to view as too often is the case in Washington today, and that is the pursuit of power above all else--certainly, the pursuit of power above principle, all too frequently. And that is not how it should be. 
   I remind my colleagues, the majority, that the test of character is not how you behave when you are weak; the real test of character is when we see how you behave when you are strong. That is what we see today. I am afraid we are not passing this test if we go forward and gag and muzzle the minority from offering our ideas to the American people. 
   Let me offer this observation in conclusion. 
   I represent a State of 6 million souls. I believe I was elected to represent them on the floor of the Senate, to offer the ideas that will best serve to increase the opportunity that they will have in their lives. That is why I was sent to the Senate. It is not right to muzzle their elected Representative from offering the ideas that I believe will serve them best, or the Senator of Nevada believes will serve his constituents best, or the Senator from Minnesota or the other Senators in this body. 
   I have hanging in my office a print entitled ``The United States Senate,'' circa 1850. It is a wonderful print that I believe embodies the history and the legacy of this institution at its finest. 
   In the center of this print is Henry Clay, speaking on the floor of the Senate in the historic Old Senate Chamber. And listening intently to him on the floor of the Senate were some of the giants in the Senate: Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, Thomas Hart Benton. Future Presidents of the United States were in attendance listening to the debate. 
   They were not debating an arcane subject that would be of no interest to the people of this country. They were debating the very union that is the foundation upon which our Nation is built. What would our forefathers think of the changes that have taken place in this Senate if they felt that the issues of union and disunion, States rights and Federal rights, the very liberties we hold dear, were no longer allowed to be debated on the floor of the Senate?

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, in a few short moments we will be proceeding to our final votes of our four day debate on the Republican and Democratic versions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am taking the floor this evening to explain why I oppose both these proposals and to express my support, again, for the bipartisan approach to managed care reform that I sponsored with my colleagues JOHN CHAFEE, BOB GRAHAM, JOE LIEBERMAN, ARLEN SPECTER, MAX BAUCUS and CHUCK ROBB. 
   One of the most difficult obstacles to meaningful health care reform is that there is an inherent tension between our two most important objectives. 
   The first objective is to ensure the highest possible quality care. Regardless of our vantage point on the political spectrum, we can all agree that the United States offers the best quality health care in the world. Men, women and children flock here from every corner of the globe to gain access to our physicians and our hospitals. Maintaining this high standard of care must be at the forefront of any attempt to reform the means by which Americans pay for their health care. 
   Seemingly at odds with the objective of highest quality care is the need to make sure that health care is affordable. The ability to cure disease or heal the injured is rendered almost meaningless if only a fraction of the population can afford it. 
   Spiraling health care costs have a negative impact upon society in a variety of ways--some obvious and some not so obvious. I well remember the situation in Indiana when I took over as Governor. In the midst of our worst recession since the 1930s, our Medicaid costs were increasing by 20% per year, an increase that mirrored substantial annual hikes in the private market. 
   One clear result was that workers around the state were losing insurance as business after business found themselves unable to pay for even basic health coverage. 
   But for both the state government and for those businesses that maintained health insurance, the spiraling increases crowded out funding for many other significant initiatives and investments. On the state level, paying increased Medicaid bills meant less for education, transportation and child care. For private businesses the choices were equally stark--pay increased insurance costs and in so doing postpone expanding the workforce, offering pay increases, investing in research or modernizing factories and offices. 
   In 1989, we began to make some very tough decisions in Indiana to bring the Medicaid budget under control; private businesses similarly began to turn to managed care. For the past ten years, those changes have helped to keep health care costs under control and have resulted in continuing insurance coverage without having to choose between offering health insurance or creating new jobs, or maintaining Medicaid or education funding. 
   But today, there is ample evidence--acknowledged by Democrats and Republicans alike--that the pendulum may have swung too far towards keeping costs down, and as a result, we are jeopardizing the quality of health care that Americans receive. 
   In trying to redress this imbalance, there are a few lessons that we learned in Indiana that were useful principles for me to keep in mind as this debate progressed. 
   First, and perhaps most importantly, any significant reform had to be market-based. Any attempt to have the government control the health care system would be doomed to failure. 
   The Chafee-Graham bi-partisan bill that I have supported since taking office is market based; it sets some basic ground rules but leaves that actual management of health care to the experts in the private sector--the patients, the doctors and the insurers. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican plan takes the concept of market-based reform to its illogical extreme. That plan falls far short of establishing even the most basic protections for people in managed care. Most egregiously, the Nickles-Lott bill would only cover a fraction--less than 30%--of the people who have private insurance. We have all accepted the idea that there ought to be some minimum protections and  guarantees offered to those in managed care to prevent the abuses that we have witnessed over the past few years. But if all sides have accepted that principle, it seems very unfair that the majority would choose to leave nearly 120 million people out of the protections we all believe are necessary. 
   I strongly support the elements of the Democratic approach that advance these principles--access to specialists, proper emergency care, access to obstetrician/gynecologists, independent reviews of denial of care--but the bipartisan bill wisely avoids the one element of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights that I believe will drive health care costs up: expanded liability. 
   If health care costs do not remain under control, there are serious ramifications for both the national economy and for the American taxpayer. 
   The United States already pays more--expressed as a percentage of GDP--for health care than any other industrialized nation. A rise in these costs will have an appreciable negative impact upon our economic strength in an increasingly competitive global environment. With pressure from a unified Europe and resurgent Asia, the last thing this Congress ought to do is to help spur a dramatic rise in health care costs for a liability provision that is unlikely to make any American healthier. 
   And the American taxpayer is at risk if health care costs spiral out of control because it is the taxpayer who will foot the bill if hundreds of thousands of people are suddenly forced into the Medicaid system if they lose their health benefits. We simply, as a nation, cannot afford a return to the days when health care costs increased by double digits every year. 
   The bipartisan bill does allow some tightly controlled access to the Federal courts for suits that seek restitution for economic loss. It seems to me that before we expose health care plans and employers to unlimited liability and to punitive damages, we must at least try this limited, moderate approach. 
   Mr. President today we will face a test of whether Washington can still work. The American people will be watching to see if their cynicism and apathy towards the political process in general and Washington, in particular, will be deepened or whether we can put partisanship aside and restore their confidence in our ability to govern for the benefit of the nation. 
   Some in this chamber truly do not want to have any legislation that reforms the way in which HMOs operate; some do not want to have any legislation so that they can have an issue for the 2000 elections. 
   Neither approach serves the American people very well and that is why I support the bi-partisan bill as the only possibility to actually get something done. The Democratic proposal will not pass the Senate; the Republican proposal will be vetoed by the President and that veto will not be overridden. Compromise is the only possibility before us for success in this area. 
   The bipartisan bill strikes the right balance between additional patient protections and maintaining control of increasing health care costs. In the final analysis, we have a choice to make: do we choose to just give more speeches that won't help anyone, or do we try to get something done? Are we going to insist upon everything that we want, or will we put aside our partisan differences to get some of what the American people want? 
   It is my hope, even if that vote doesn't occur today, that the members of this Senate will pass the test by finally putting aside the rancor and bitterness of the past four days, to put aside the desire to score debating points off each other, and to rally around this centrist, responsible bi-partisan bill that will give the American people the key components of HMO reform that they need and deserve.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator RICHARD LUGAR, to introduce legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame. 
   This bipartisan effort recognizes Father Hesburgh for his outstanding contributions to the civil rights movement and to improving higher education. His efforts have provided benefits not only to the people of the United States but to the global community as well. 
   Over the years, Father Hesburgh has held 15 presidential appointments and remains a national leader in the fields of education, civil rights and development of the world's poorest nations. Most notable among Father Hesburgh's many previous awards is the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, bestowed on him by President Johnson in 1964. 
   Mr. President, Father Hesburgh has been a champion of the civil rights movement for more than forty years. He was a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1957, and served as Chairman of the commission from 1969-72. His relentless pursuit of justice, peace and equality continue to inspire people around the world. 
   Despite Father Hesburgh's commitment and obligations to Notre Dame and the various commissions he served, he still managed to give a sufficient amount of time and attention to global problems. Father Hesburgh served four Popes in many capacities, including as the permanent Vatican City representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna from 1956-1970. In 1971, he joined the board of Overseas Developing Council, a private organization supporting interests of the underdeveloped world, and chaired it until  1982. During this time, he led fund-raising efforts that averted mass starvation in Cambodia in the immediate aftermath of the Khmer Rouge. 
   Notre Dame is perhaps most celebrated for its athletic prowess, but these on-the-field achievements should not overshadow Notre Dame's place as a world class institution of learning and scholarship. When Father Hesburgh stepped down as head of Notre Dame in 1987, he ended the longest tenure among active presidents of American institutions of higher learning. The accomplishments made during Father Hesburgh's tenure are perhaps best reflected in the significant gains made from the time he took over as the 15th president of Notre Dame in 1952, up until his departure. By the time Father Hesburgh left Notre Dame, enrollment had doubled, the number of faculty had tripled, and the number of degrees offered by the school had grown to over 2,500. 
   Most strikingly, Father Hesburgh was responsible for making dramatic changes to the University's composition by admitting women to Notre Dame. He also established several of Notre Dame's prestigious institutions, both the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies. 
   Today, even in retirement, Father Hesburgh continues to be a leading educator and humanitarian, inspiring generations of students and citizens, while generously sharing his wisdom in the struggle for the rights of man. 
   That is why we rise today to introduce legislation in the Senate honoring this man with a Congressional Gold Medal for his outstanding contributions to the University of Notre Dame, our country and the global community.

   Mr. BAYH. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for his very persuasive remarks. This is a major industry in both of our States. We both share a commitment to dealing with this issue. So I appreciate your leadership very much, I say to Senator SPECTER. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act. I would like to begin by commending our colleague, Senator BYRD, who had to leave for just a brief period of time for other pressing matters. I commend him for adopting an approach that is not just good for West Virginia, not just good for the steel industry, but good for the Nation. 
   Senator BYRD's dedication to doing what is right for America, and not just the narrower parochial concerns, was evidenced very clearly in the colloquy we heard between Senator DOMENICI and Senator BYRD in which Senator BYRD was going to accommodate the national interests in allowing a supplemental appropriations bill to go forward at a time our Nation was involved in military action abroad. That is indicative of his lengthy record of national leadership. 
   As further evidence that the approach favored by Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI, and others of my colleagues, is the correct approach, I am pleased to identify several Governors who have written to endorse this legislation. The list will demonstrate that it has broad regional support from the East to the West, from the North to the South. Not only my own Governor of the State of Indiana, but the Governor of Maryland, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Governor of Illinois, the Governor of West Virginia, the Governor of Iowa, the Governor of Utah, and the Governor of 
   South Carolina have written to express their strong, unequivocal support for taking immediate action to address this very critical situation. 
   Likewise, I urge that this bill be passed expeditiously and without amendment. We have a crisis on our hands. It is very important that we not get bogged down in other extraneous matters but that we move this legislation forward unencumbered. 
   I sometimes wonder what citizens think when they view us at our work here. We have prerogatives, of course. We have rights, of course. But it is important at this time, with the situation in the oil and gas industry, with the situation in the steel industry, that we move this bill forward cleanly and expeditiously and, I for one would hope, without amendment. 
   I know something about this issue, having served as Governor of my State for 8 years and now in the Senate. Indiana happens to be the largest steel-producing State in the United States of America, producing more tons of steel than any of our 49 sister States. We currently have approximately 30,000 working men and women employed in the steel industry in Indiana. These are good-quality jobs, with high wages, high benefits, the kind of employment around which you can raise and support a family and a decent quality of life. 
   Many communities in our State, particularly in northwest Indiana, are dependent upon the health and vigor of this industry for their very livelihoods. The last 20 years or so have not always been good times for the steel industry across our State or across our country. In my State alone, over the last 20 years we have seen tens of thousands of jobs disappear. Our market share has shrunk. Perhaps some of this was inevitable, but perhaps some was not. 
   There was a point in time when the industry had to acknowledge its fair share of the blame for the state of affairs. They perhaps had been too complacent, had not made the investment in the latest technology and equipment to be world-class competitive. But those days and those arguments no longer apply. 
   This industry and the workers who labor within it have invested hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, in the very latest kinds of equipment, the latest technology. If you  tour the steel mills across our State, and elsewhere, they are state of the art, world class, world competitive. We are in a position today where we can produce steel of the highest quality, at an internationally competitive price, if it is fair competition. 
   But, as we all know, since last year the competition has been anything but fair. Given the collapse of currencies across Southeast Asia, many of those countries were desperate--desperate to export their steel and to gain hard currency under any terms, in any circumstances. A flood of illegal--and I stress ``illegal''--imports began to come across our shores. 
   Just this week, our Government has indicated that Japan has been involved in illegal trade practices. And there were other countries cited for this activity before that. This is just the latest evidence of the kind of unfair and illegal trade competition we have been facing since at least last year. 
   The consequences have been very damaging. We have had several companies go out of business, thousands of jobs lost; and once these companies shut their doors and close down, once 
   their jobs are lost, in all likelihood they will be permanent losses to our economy, with consequences to these families and these communities that go way beyond the economic toll. 
   This legislation is a balanced approach to dealing with this problem. It is fair to taxpayers, because the costs are offset with reductions elsewhere. It requires the loans to be repaid in only 6 and a half years, which is a relatively short period of time for major loans of this nature. There is a panel established to scrutinize every loan before it is given to make sure that the recipients are creditworthy and, in fact, that the taxpayers will be ultimately repaid. 
   Before closing, I will say just a couple more words about this bill because, as I mentioned, the consequences are national. In my own mind, they deal with trade and other industries as well. I personally believe that free and fair trade and competition is good for our country. It is good for consumers--with higher-quality, lower-cost goods at their disposal. It is good for our economy, because it forces us to be competitive and productive. In the long run, it leads to the most efficient allocation of resources. 
   But when trade is illegal, when other countries undertake steps that are not fair, are not just, and, any economist would say, in the long run do not lead to an efficient allocation of resources or a good deal for consumers or working men and women in this country, that is the kind of thing where we must take a stand. 
   If I am to go back to the citizens of my State and argue why free trade is in our best interest, it must go hand in hand with vigorous enforcement of current law and helping those industries that have been targeted by illegal activity. I emphasize that the pernicious effects of this illegal dumping will last a long time after the dumping has stopped. 
   Many of our companies have been permanently weakened. If we do not take these steps to allow them to get back on their feet, to allow them to overcome the consequences of this sort of illegal activity, who can say who will be next? Quite possibly, one of our foreign competitors will say: I'll pay a few fines in the short run, bear that short-run cost to permanently, in the long run, weaken American competitors. 
   That is not right. This loan guarantee program will allow these companies that have been harmed by this illegal activity to get back on their feet, to regain their competitive standing, so that we will have free and fair competition moving forward. 
   So, in conclusion, this is a bill of national consequence, not just to any one State or region; its interests go way beyond the steel and natural gas and oil industries to affect literally the long-term well-being and competitiveness of the American economy as a whole. That is why I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation, to do it now, and to do it without amendment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, for your patience, your time. I thank Senator DOMENICI for his leadership on this issue, and many others as well. 
   I am now pleased to yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President today I rise as a co-sponsor of the Work Incentives Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that removes the disincentives currently hindering those people with disabilities who wish to enter the workforce. We all owe our thanks to Senators MOYNIHAN, ROTH, and KENNEDY for their leadership on this bill. 
   When people want to work the federal government should not stand in their way. When people want to be productive members of our society, taxpaying citizens, the federal government should not stand in their way. Currently, 72% of Americans with disabilities want to work. However, nearly 75% of persons with disabilities are unemployed. We are sending the wrong message right now. The current set of rules make it more economically beneficial for someone with a disability to stay at home than to enter the workforce. There needs to be a transition period put in place to assist those with disabilities before we expect them to become financially independant. We do this with other programs and it is about time we apply such logic to this sector of our community. By passing this bill, if only 1% of the currently disabled Americans become fully employed, the federal savings in disability benefits would total $3.5 billion over the lifetime of the beneficiaries. Once again, investing in people creates a great rate of return. 
   In Indiana there are 348,000 people between the ages of 16 and 64 who have a disability. I have heard numerous stories from Hoosiers with disabilities who want to work and are able to work. They have told me how work will mean more than a paycheck for them. It is an opportunity for them to be a productive and contributing member of the community, work towards self-sufficiency, and most importantly, to have a sense of pride in being needed. 
   Let me tell you about Bob Neal, an employee of the Indianapolis Police Department. He is 42 years old and doesn't want to give up his job even though it would be much easier for him financially if he did. Bob has muscular dystrophy. When asked why he is still working he said ``I just figure if I stay home I'll get fatter than I am and get lazy and die earlier. I look forward to working. You gotta have a little pride somewhere. That is why I stay here, because of these people, I could go back to Illinois and never work again, but these people, they know me here.'' Bob's story displays the problem with the current predicament in which most people with disabilities find themselves. This bill will address situations similar to that of Bob Neal. It will provide access to health coverage and provide employment assistance while creating incentives to work. It is important to allow Medicare coverage for people with disabilities while they are working so their health can continue to improve. It is no surprise this bill has such overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle. 
   Today, I will vote in support of this bill with pride for those who take advantage of this newly created opportunity. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill and send the message that people with disabilities will no longer need to chose between working and remaining healthy.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as an original co-sponsor of the Prenatal Child and Infant Development Act, a bipartisan bill to provide states with the flexibility they need to address the needs of children during their formative years. 
   Children are born into this world with all the potential they need to make their dreams come true. The ages of birth to 3 are the most critical for a child's development both mentally and socially. They have all the 100 billion brains cells they will need as adults. By age three, children have nearly all the necessary connections between the brain cells needed for the brain to function fully and properly. It is up to us, families, teachers, childcare providers, and communities to help our children live up to their potential. It is important that our children are ready to learn and we allow them the opportunity to maximize their potential. What income bracket a child is born into should not determine that child's future. If a child is not provided with proper health care, nutritional food, and a nurturing environment to grow up in, we are leading down a very dark path. 
   Sadly, it has been confirmed that children who lack proper nutrition, health care, and nurturing during their first years also lack the adequate social, motor, and language skills needed to perform well in school and in life. That is why I have joined efforts with Senator VOINOVICH and Senator GRAHAM and support the Prenatal Child and Infant Development Act. This initiative has bipartisan support because it is important legislation that addresses something we should all have in common, helping our children prepare for the future. A child birth to 3 years old that is in need of assistance can not do it on her own. 
   Specifically, this bill will allow States to transfer up to 45% of the money they receive for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to the Child Care Development Block Grant or the Social Services Block Grant. The 15% increase in transferability will go towards increasing local early childhood development coordination councils and to enhance child care quality under the existing Child Care Development Block Grant. This new flexibility will allow states to spend the money needed to ensure our children are not sentenced to unfulfillment of their dreams just because they were denied child care services during their most vital development stages. 
   In Indiana, there are over 488,000 children under the age of six. 70% of those children are in child care. Indiana is one of those states that has transferred the entire amount currently allowed from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds to the Child Care Development Block Grant for child care services and quality initiatives. Even after the State was able to provide services for 65,185 children, there still remains a need to help at least an additional 267,500 children. There is a need in my State to have the flexibility to transfer and utilize funds that otherwise are not being spent so these children can be served. 
   One of the programs this new flexibility will allow to expand in Indiana is the Building Bright Beginnings Coalition. This coalition is focused on assisting children that are prenatal to four years old. They have reached over 150,000 parents of newborns through their publication ``A Parent's Guide to Raising Health, Happy Babies''. The coalition has implemented the ``See and Demand Quality Child Care'' campaign consisting of public service announcements, billboards, pamphlets, and a toll-free telephone line for parent information in cooperation with local resources and referral agencies. It also makes loans available to child care providers who are considered non-traditional borrowers, and it has formed an institute that creates a public private partnership with higher education as well as the health, education, and early childhood communities. In the short time this program has been in place, it has helped over 100,000 parents of newborns be better informed, over 10,000 new public private partnerships have been formed, and it has directly impacted the lives of over 15,000 children. We need more programs like this and in order for them to exist States need more flexibility with their funding streams. 
   These quality initiatives are administered by Indiana's Step Ahead Councils. Step Ahead Councils are the types of councils this bill hopes to promote. Indiana has had a council in each of its 92 counties since 1991. These councils allow for locally focused solutions and initiatives to locally based challenges with child care, parent information, early intervention, child nutrition and health screening. Local responses to local problems can create better solutions. This bill encourages such local involvement. 
   In addition, there are several other important goals this bill helps to accomplish. It will allow more programs to address the needs of prenatal to three year olds, it will increase satellite training for Head Start and other childhood program staff, it will increase direct child care and health services, and will encourage States to implement training programs for childcare providers. 
   As a Senator and a father of two 3 1/2 year old boys, I am proud to support  this bill and publically voice the need to invest in all children. There is no better way to utlize a dollar than to invest it in our future. Thank you Senator VOINOVICH and Senator GRAHAM for initiating this legislation, I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, to support this bill and the message behind it.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bryan amendment, which contains, in my opinion, a balanced approach to the Community Reinvestment Act as well as a bipartisan spirit enjoyed in the last session of Congress. 
   I also want to say, to my colleague from the State of Texas, how much I respect his expertise in this area as well as his dedication to this cause. But I must also respectfully disagree and say to all those who are concerned about this issue that if there are problems with this amendment, in terms of  the fines that can be imposed or other details, let's correct them. If, in the past, overly zealous advocates have used CRA as an excuse for extortion, then let's prosecute them. If there are other problems, let's correct them. 
   Let's throw out the bathwater, not the baby. At the dawn of the 21st century, let us not turn back the clock and deny to thousands of Americans, because of the color of their skin, because of their race, because of their income, the right to access one of the basic tools for empowerment and progress, and that is credit and the ability to start a business or build a home. We cannot return to those days. 
   I should also say I am somewhat disappointed that we have arrived at this impasse, because this is important legislation. It is my great hope we will ultimately get it enacted, 
   because it is important to the financial services industry, insurance, banking, as well as other industries that need access to credit and to consumers across our country. This should not be a partisan debate. In fact, in the very recent past, it has been nonpartisan or even bipartisan. Unfortunately, it has become an issue that has broken down more and more along party lines. 
   I especially regret this has happened in large part because of efforts to curtail and restrict the Community Reinvestment Act, which the vast majority of evidence has suggested works well, has served the American people well in the past, and I believe is critical to equal opportunity for all Americans as we advance to a new century and a new millennium. 
   We are increasingly relying upon the use of market forces to create opportunity. We are asking the American people to be self-sufficient, to save, to work hard, to be personally responsible, and I support those trends. At the same time, we need to ensure that the market system works for all Americans and that every American, regardless of whether that person happens to come from the right side of the tracks or the wrong side of the tracks, be he or she Hispanic, African American, Native American or any other race, creed or religion in this society, that they have access to those tools in the marketplace that will allow them to be self-sufficient, to build a better way of life for themselves and their families. 
   It is important that we pass this law, as I mentioned. It is one of the areas in which we are internationally competitive. It is important that we pass legislation that will allow our financial services industry to provide comprehensive services to their customers and to compete with our foreign competitors. 
   It is important that consumers be allowed to have access to these services on a coordinated basis, on a one-stop shopping basis. It is better for consumers as well. It means jobs for your State and my State and the rest of the 48 States across the United States of America, not just in insurance, which is important to the State of Indiana, or investment banking or in securities or on the part of insurance company employees, agents, and brokers across this country. It means jobs for small businesses and industries in the State of Indiana and elsewhere that need access to low-cost credit, so that they can invest, be more competitive, more productive and create good-paying jobs across our country. This is an issue not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street and for all of our streets across this country. 
   Unfortunately, there has been increasing partisanship. I think that is very, very important. Just last year this measure passed out of the Senate Banking Committee on a 16-to-2 vote. This year, unfortunately, it broke down exactly along party lines, 11 to 9. 
   Earlier this year, this provision, very similar to the amendment I am supporting today, passed out of the House of Representatives Banking Committee 52 to 8, with the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats supporting a continuation of a vital CRA and equal financial opportunity for all Americans. 
   The administration strongly supports this point of view. It is important to note that there is virtually no significant opposition from industry groups. I find it to be somewhat ironic that in the past, members of my own party have been accused of favoring legislation that would unduly hamstring business for ideological reasons. Today, the shoe seems to be on the other foot. 
   Let me be very clear what this dispute that has brought us to this impasse is not about. It is not about the organization under which future banking, insurance and security services will be offered. This is not really a dispute about operating subsidiaries versus the affiliates and holding companies, although there is a very serious dispute between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on this issue. I am convinced that 
   this can be resolved if we are given a chance. 
   Our dispute in this impasse is really not about the unitary thrift and whether commercial entities should be allowed to get involved in the financial services sector. That is a legitimate issue and a concern that I am convinced that, too, can be resolved if we can only deal with the issue currently before us. No, Mr. President, the dispute that has brought us to this point involves the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   I say to my colleagues and those listening and watching us at home that the Community Reinvestment Act has been good for America and good for Americans. It is working. Between 1993 and 1997--4 years--loans in low- and middle-income areas across our country for mortgages and building homes increased 45 percent, 45 percent in just 4 years; up 72 percent for African Americans; up 45 percent for Hispanic Americans; up 30 percent for Native Americans. 
   In the same period of time, actually just last year alone, there were 525,000 loans to small business men and women in low- and moderate-income areas, with total capital investments of $34 billion. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act has proven to be a boom for the American dream: families wishing to invest in home ownership, entrepreneurs wishing to start small businesses, Americans of every race, creed and religion wanting to participate in the American dream of a better way of life for themselves and for their loved ones. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act has worked in my own home State of Indiana. I won't go through all the cases here. From Gary, East Chicago, Indianapolis, South Bend, Lafayette, Bloomington, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in communities large and small across my State, more Hoosiers have opportunities to make investments, make a decent income through a good job, buy a home, or start a small business. It has been good for our country. It has been good for my State. 
   Mr. President, I have a letter with me today that I think my colleagues will find to be of some interest. It was sent to me 2 days ago. It happens to be from the mayor of the city of Fort Wayne. The reason this may be of interest is that Fort Wayne is the second largest city in the State of Indiana. More than that, Paul Helmke, the mayor of Fort Wayne, happened to be my opponent in the race for the Senate last year. 
   Paul Helmke is a card-carrying member of the Republican Party. He also believes in opportunities for the citizens of Fort Wayne, business investment expansion, and home ownership. The mayor of Fort Wayne, my opponent in the election last year, has written me asking me to support a vigorous and vital Community Reinvestment Act. 
   I read from his correspondence:  
   ......In Fort Wayne, banks have fulfilled their CRA requirements in creative and meaningful ways that have allowed us to leverage their resources with public and other private influences to help in our urban revitalization efforts. 
   ......Perhaps the banking community would continue to see their investment in urban renewal as beneficial without the CRA requirements. But I do not think that it is wise to tempt fate.  
   Mr. President, neither do I. Involved mayors, like Mayor Helmke, who was the head of the mayors association last year, and I believe concerned Senators should rise to vote in favor of a vital and continually vigorous Community Reinvestment Act. On April 22 of this year, the Los Angeles Times wrote:  
   Before Congress voted to establish the CRA in 1977, many banks wrote off entire areas, refusing to lend to anyone who lived behind the red line.  
   The unfortunate truth is that while the vast majority of bankers across our country are involved and caring and doing a good job, both before and afterwards, too often there were bankers  who were willing to accept deposits from some parts of our communities and not make loans to those very same parts of our communities. That is what CRA has established. It is a very strong track record of change. 
   Unfortunately, the bill, as unamended, before us poses a serious threat to the continuation of this progress we have seen across this country and in my State. My understanding is it would make 97 percent of all banks presumptively exempt from the requirements of CRA, 38 percent entirely exempt from the provisions of CRA, and would exclude the whole new areas banks hope to get into, entirely exempt, new users entirely exempt from the provisions of CRA. Mr. President, now is not the time to turn back the clock. 
   I will summarize before yielding the floor. Access to credit today is as important an opportunity for Americans of every walk of life as rural electrification was in the 1930s. Access to credit today is as important to the future well-being of all of our citizens as universal service to telephones was in the fifties and the sixties. 
   That is why I believe very strongly, as we ask Americans to be more responsible, to take charge of their own lives, as we encourage them to start homes and build businesses and to build for the future, we must give them the tools within the market economy to get the job done. That means equal access to credit as we approach the new millennium, not just to the few, not just to the powerful, but to Americans of every race, ethnicity, and those of even modest means. That, Mr. President, is why I rise in support of the Bryan amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative for it. 
   Thank you. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BAYH. I say to the Senator, I appreciate your question. As a matter of fact, one of the things that has been most impressive about this issue has been the uniformity of opinion among our banks in my State, large and small. They find that CRA has not been a significant impediment to their doing business, and really the industry groups are not in opposition at all. As a matter of fact, they support the intent behind this very, very important provision. 
   So we have a situation here where many of our community groups, including our mayors--as a matter of fact, I should mention for the RECORD I spoke to the mayor or Gary last night, as well, who believes very strongly that a city like Gary, which has been struggling to get back on its feet, needs this provision. 
   The banks are not opposed and, in fact, find it to be a very positive element.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I echo the words of the Senator from Maryland in complimenting my friend from North Carolina for his eloquence and his insightful presentation on a continued, strong CRA. I observe and I can tell that he has taken his advocacy skills from the courtroom to the floor of the Senate, and the American people are better for it. 
   I compliment the Senator on his statement, which is built upon what the ranking member said in the statement he read from the Conference of Mayors. The Senator from North Carolina has become a dear friend and someone I have admiration and great respect for. I have heard the Senator mention on many occasions his dedication to ensuring that not just big cities or large institutions have opportunities, but that the farmers and small rural areas across North Carolina are afforded the same opportunities as those in the large cities and in the large financial institutions. 
   My question is this: Very often, this financial modernization bill is portrayed as something that just Wall Street and big institutions are interested in. The Senator touched on this briefly, and there is one thing I was hoping he can expand on. I wonder if his experience in North Carolina is the same as ours in Indiana, which is that CRA can be an engine for making sure that farmers and small businesses in rural areas are afforded the same kinds of opportunities as the mayors indicated the cities enjoy.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, states have been struggling for years to ensure safe, responsible management of out-of-state municipal solid waste. As Governor of Indiana, I tried to ensure that Indiana's disposal capacity would meet Indiana's municipal solid waste needs. Efforts to institute effective waste management policies were--and continue to be--thwarted by two obstacles. The first is the massive and unpredictable amounts of out-of-state waste flowing into state disposal facilities. States' attempts to address that problem run into the second obstacle. The Supreme Court has established, in a series of opinions, that Congress must first provide the states the authority to regulate interstate waste. 
   I rise with my colleague today to introduce legislation to do just that. 
   Senator VOINOVICH and I, as Governors, participated in a cooperative effort to develop a set of principles for federal action on interstate waste. The Voinovich/Bayh interstate waste control bill is based on those principles. Mr. President, the need for controls in interstate waste is even more acute today than when I was a Governor. Current governors supporting our bill know this better than anyone. 
   In Indiana, waste imports are again on the rise. After decreasing from 1992 to 1994, waste imports increased significantly in 1995 and doubled in 1996. Between 1996 and 1998, out-of state waste received by Indiana facilities increased by 32 percent to their highest level in the last seven years. In fact, in 1998, 2.8 million tons of out-of-state waste were disposed of in Indiana--that's 19 percent of all the waste disposed of in Indiana's landfills. Our Department of Environmental Management has predicted that the state will run out of landfill space in 2011--or earlier, so the time for action is now. 
   Senator VOINOVICH and I believe we have crafted a comprehensive, equitable approach to interstate waste management. Our bill will give states the power to ensure manageable and predictable waste flows by freezing waste imports at 1993 levels. States bearing the greatest burden of interstate waste--those that disposed of more than 650,000 tons in 1993--could reduce imported waste to 65 percent of the 1993 level by 2006. Our bill will give states the power to set a percentage limitation on the amount of out-of-state waste that new or expanding facilities could receive and give states the option to deny a permit to a new or expanding facility if there is no regional or in-state need for the facility. Local governments would have more power to determine whether they want to accept out-of-state waste. They would be able to prohibit local disposal facilities that didn't receive out-of-state waste in 1993 from starting to take it until the local government approved. This presumptive ban on interstate waste would not interfere with facilities operating under existing host community agreements or permits. 
   This bill is the culmination of the work we did as Governors and the coalition we are building as Senators. It attempts to forge a new and workable compromise between the needs and rights of importing and exporting states and gives the people who must live with waste planning decisions the power to make them. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important legislation forward.

   Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for awarding Mrs. Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of her contributions to the nation. 
   On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks got on a bus--a quiet, proud woman, bound unfairly by the laws of our country and the limits of her surroundings. But by the time the police took her off that bus, she was bound only by the strength of her will, a will that refused to be moved. 
   Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. 
   Somewhere, in the brief moment that separates a spoken objection from an act of protest, Rosa Parks emerged as the ``first lady of civil rights,'' and the ``mother of the freedom movement.'' We look at this woman's accomplishment and we salute her for the civil rights movement she helped set in motion. We look back now, and we applaud the monumental force which is still a vital part of our society today. 
   Back in the 1950's, in a small city, on an ordinary bus, she had neither titles nor honorifics. She was just Rosa Parks--and ``just'' Rosa Parks refused to let others limit what she was supposed to do. Her act was defined, not by its violence, but rather by its non-violent challenge towards a violent system. 
   Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. 
   If our country's history has taught us anything, it is that small decisions of action can change our world. If Rosa Parks has taught us anything, it is that the courageous action of one individual can be more powerful than the shouted declaration of a crowd. 
   Thus, I am honored today to join with my colleagues in honoring this great American whose courage, dignity, and character have continued to serve as an inspiration for the quiet but heroic actions that shape our world.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my senior colleague, DICK LUGAR, who, unfortunately, could not be with us at the last moment. I know he will be submitting his own remarks on behalf of the Lady Boilermakers and their outstanding victory in the NCAA women's basketball tournament this year. I know the rules prohibit me from pointing anybody out in the galleries, but I want to say how much I appreciate the presence of several constituents today; in particular, the mayor of West Lafayette, IN, several officials representing Purdue University, and several of our distinguished citizens from Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, and elsewhere across our State. 
   Mr. President, basketball is perhaps synonymous with the State of Indiana, not only because we love to play the game, not only because we believe in physical fitness, but because of the character, the determination, and the other fine attributes associated with that sport that are necessary for success in it.  
   This year's Purdue women's basketball team, perhaps better than any other, exhibits those character traits. They are an example of Indiana at its finest and the United States of America at its finest. So I rise today to salute them both as individuals and as a team for their accomplishments. 
   Mr. President, this team was an example of near perfection. Their record was an outstanding 34 victories and only 1 defeat. They are the first women's championship team representing any Big Ten university in any sport. Their coach, Carolyn Peck, an outstanding individual, is not only the youngest coach to lead a winning team to the NCAA tournament, but she is also the first African American one to do it. One of their star players, Stephanie White-McCarty, is not only a first-team athletic all-American, but also an academic all-American. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, she represents the rest of the team very well in that regard. 
   The team, as a whole, had a combined grade point average of 3.0, which is very good by today's standards, particularly with regard to the athletic community. 
   Mr. President, once again, I salute the Lady Boilermakers for their outstanding contributions not only on the basketball court, but because of the outstanding individuals they are.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I take the floor today to bring to the attention of my colleagues Indiana's celebration of Medical Laboratory Week. 
   In the world of health care, it is easy to forget that quality medical testing and exceptional patient care is a team effort. Doctors are the visible element in this complex harmony, but there is another, less visible, but equally important element involved. 
   Medical laboratory professionals are highly-trained health personnel who perform and evaluate those medical laboratory tests necessary to detect, diagnose, and monitor treatment of diseases. They also help to prevent diseases, while at the same time tirelessly working to develop new methods of combating them. These dedicated men and women save countless lives each day through their firm commitment to a healthier community. 
   Laboratory medicine is an honorable profession, in its constant and consistent dedication to the well-being of the greater community. Let us not forget that it is also an inseparable and invaluable part of health care without the often-unsung efforts of these fine people, medicine as we know it would not exist. 
   I therefore ask my colleagues, as well as all citizens, to join me and the State of Indiana in recognizing and supporting the vital service provided by medical laboratory professionals.

   Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair. I express my appreciation to my colleagues here today and find myself in agreement with what my colleagues from North Dakota and Massachusetts have been saying on this amendment. 
   Mr. President, my statement today is in the nature of general debate. 
   I rise to give my first public remarks on the floor of the United States Senate. 
   I rise at this time because as debate on the last budget of the 20th Century begins, we have an historic opportunity  to build a strong financial foundation for the 21st. 
   The projected budget surpluses give us a once in a generation opportunity we must not squander. We must seize this moment of good fortune and replace the debt and deficit, borrow and spend mentality of the recent past with a more responsible approach. We must get our priorities right: preserve Social Security and Medicare, pay off our debts, target tax cuts to help working families and make investments in education and national defense. 
   I believe strongly that the first step toward this more prosperous future must be to save Social Security and stabilize Medicare. To achieve this, I wholeheartedly support preserving 100% of Social Security Trust Funds for Social Security and 40% of other surplus funds for Medicare. 
   Let me address Social Security first. By ending once and for all the irresponsible practice of raiding the Social Security Trust Fund, we will extend the life of Social Security by 17 years to the year 2049. We owe it to our seniors to ensure that their Social Security will be safe, and our younger workers have a right to know that the system will be there for them one day. Using surplus funds to save Social Security first is the fiscally responsible, socially compassionate way to achieve this. 
   Medicare, quite frankly, presents an even more urgent challenge. Without action, it will be insolvent in only eight years. To prevent this, I support dedicating an additional $376 billion of the surplus over the next ten years to Medicare. This will more than double its solvency, to 2020. 
   But let me be very clear. These investments alone are NOT the complete answer to either Social Security's or Medicare's problems. We must be willing to make the difficult decisions needed to save these vital services, not just once, but once and for all. 
   It won't be easy. None of the solutions is popular. But using the surplus to strengthen both Social Security and Medicare in the near term will make long-term, systemic reforms possible. The American people are much more likely to embrace difficult steps taken gradually than they are the more draconian action that not using the surplus for Medicare would entail. Those who propose nothing for Medicare today, court fiscal disaster tomorrow. We must not let that happen, and under our approach it will not. 
   Our approach to saving Social Security and stabilizing Medicare has enormous benefits in addition to securing the future for our elderly and keeping commitments to our young. Doing so will also dramatically reduce the national debt. 
   Paying down the national debt has many virtues. Lower debt will reduce our interest payments. Last year, 15 cents of every tax dollar went for nothing productive. It merely serviced our national debt. Under the approach I favor, interest payments shrink to only 4 cents of every tax dollar in ten years--a savings to taxpayers of $452 billion dollars. And if we continue this approach, the debt will fall to its lowest level--as a percentage of GDP--since 1917. 
   With spending under control, a balanced budget, and government no longer borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars, interest rates will fall. This makes it easier for private businesses to invest. New investments mean greater productivity growth, higher wages, and more secure jobs for America's working men and women. The bottom line is clear: a better standard of living for all Americans. 
   This isn't just my opinion. Last month, I had the opportunity to question the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, about this very subject. He too believes that paying down the national debt is the best way to guarantee a stronger economy and a responsible federal budget. 
   As one of the principal architects of our current economic good fortune, Alan Greenspan knows that paying down the national debt is preferable at this point in the economic cycle to either spending increases or dramatic tax reductions the nation cannot afford. As the Chairman told me, ``..... all of the arguments that one can make for tax cuts you can make for reduction in debt, they are the same forces.....'' In addition, by paying off our debts now, we preserve the nation's ability to borrow again in the event of a future emergency and hold open the option of more aggressive tax cuts should the economy slow. Simply put: paying down the national debt is the responsible, conservative, economically and fiscally sensible thing to do. 
   It is the just and morally responsible thing to do as well. It is not right to ask our children and grandchildren to pay our bills. No generation in American history has done so, and we must not become the first. 
   Our legacy to future generations must be more than an IOU. Paying down the debt will keep faith with America's past and create promise for America's future. 
   Saving Social Security and Medicare by paying down the national debt is a significant undertaking, but if we act prudently, there is room for our nation's other important priorities, including targeted tax cuts. Throughout my public career, I have been a vigorous advocate for cutting the tax burden on American families. In fact, I believe that when it comes to tax cuts--the more aggressive, the better. As Governor of Indiana, I was proud to be able to give Hoosiers the largest tax cut in our state history. 
   I strongly support targeted tax cuts here on the Federal level as well--tax cuts that will eliminate the marriage penalty, save family farms and businesses from the ravages of the estate tax, help families meet the expenses of child care or caring for an elderly parent, and create jobs and stimulate investment by reducing the tax on capital gains. 
   There must be a balance among our priorities. We can't pursue one to the exclusion of all others. If we give into temptation, and recklessly pursue immediate gratification today, we will surely regret it tomorrow. And therein lies the difference between what we accomplished in Indiana and what some now propose in Washington. Our Hoosier tax cut plan was conservative, fiscally responsible, like the approach I support today. We never threatened to throw fiscal caution to the winds or require massive cuts in vital services for children or law enforcement. 
   I will be the first to sponsor a tax cut bill--the bigger the better--but not one out of all proportion to our ability to pay for it, nor one that risks returning us to the days when America was drowning in a sea of red ink. We must cut taxes as aggressively as possible while still meeting our other important national priorities. 
   Included in these important priorities are additional investments for national defense, education and law enforcement. These are the kind of areas where even modest investments today yield multiple benefits tomorrow. 
   Because I strongly believe that government must make investments--within its means, of course--in these important areas, I am troubled by the current budget resolution that would force drastic and unwarranted across the board budget cuts in many important domestic programs ranging from Head Start to the FBI. 
   Mr. President, it is incumbent upon the Senate to resist the twin temptations of immediate gratification and postponing difficult decisions. Both parties, quite frankly, have been guilty of this for too long. Today it is the Budget Resolution that succumbs to these twin temptations, indulging us immediately with all the things we want while putting off until tomorrow the things we would rather not do but know we really must. This may be good politics. It is not good government. 
   Despite the fact that we will not achieve a bipartisan solution this week, I am still heartened by how much closer both parties are today on fiscal issues than even in the recent past. 
   It seems to me there is a national consensus growing, a consensus that cuts across party lines, that believes in some basic core principles: Saving Social Security and Medicare first, paying down the national debt, making targeted tax cuts for working families, and investing in our future. We can start down the road toward accomplishing these goals--something that is well within the grasp of this Senate--and, in so doing, build a better America. Also, we will be able to look our children and grandchildren squarely in the eye, secure in the knowledge that what we have done has not been just easiest for us, but also what is best for them.  
   Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity, and for the indulgence of my colleagues, and yield the remainder of my time.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss yesterday's overwhelming Senate vote in favor of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. I was pleased to join with many of my colleagues in support of this legislation that will help to ensure that the United States does everything it can to defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile launches, both accidental and intentional. This legislation, which makes it the policy of the United States to deploy an effective national missile defense when technologically possible, takes an important first step toward providing a significant defense for all citizens of the United States against limited ballistic missile attacks. 
   As most of my colleagues know, today, the United States faces a serious, credible, and growing threat from limited ballistic missiles that could potentially carry nuclear, biological or chemical payloads. This new threat is not from Russia, our partner in many important arms control agreements. Instead, this threat comes from the increasing proliferation of ballistic missile technology. In particular, certain rogue states pose the greatest threat as they continue to push for--and make great progress in acquiring--delivery systems that directly threaten the United States. I do not believe that the threat from these rogue states, most of which have demonstrated a complete disregard for the well-being of their own citizens as they relentlessly pursue the acquisition of this ballistic missile technology, can be understated. 
   Mr. President, this new and emerging ballistic missile threat from rogue states was dramatically highlighted by the August 1998 Taepo Dong I missile launch in North Korea. This North Korean missile launch demonstrated important aspects of intercontinental missile development. Most importantly, the missile included multiple stage separation and the use of a third stage. This use of a third stage, in particular, was surprising to our intelligence community. Using a third stage gives this missile a potential range in excess of 5,500 kilometers, thus effectively making the Taepo Dong I an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   Unfortunately, America's intelligence community did not expect the North Korean's to have the capability to make such a three stage missile. In fact, the most recent U.S. intelligence reports made prior to this Taepo Dong I launch claimed that no rogue state would have this capability for at least ten years. 
   Even before the North Koreans launched their Taepo Dong I missile last August, there were other disturbing reports that predicted the eminent ballistic missile threat to the United States. In July, the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, known as the Rumsfeld Commission, released its report. The Rumsfeld Commission was a bipartisan commission headed by former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and other well respected members in the defense community. The Rumsfeld Commission warned of the growing ballistic missile threat that rogue states posed to the United States. The Rumsfeld Commission unanimously found that, ``concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potentially hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United States, its deployed forces and its friends and allies.'' 
   The Commission reported further that, ``The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the Intelligence Community.'' 
   The launch of the Taepo Dong I missile and the findings of the Rumsfeld Commission are very troubling. It is clear that ballistic missile technology is progressing rapidly and proliferating just as rapidly and, consequently, the threat to the United States is real. It is no longer a perceived threat or a potential threat. It is not a threat that may come ten years down the road. This threat is tangible and it is here now. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to all Americans to do everything possible to defend the United States from this threat. Supporting this legislation, in my opinion, is an important step in providing a solid defense for the United States against limited ballistic missile attacks. 
   Moreover, S.257 is a responsible way to address the threat that the United States faces. In contrast to previous legislative efforts, most of which micro managed this policy by setting a fixed date for deployment and by dictating the exact type of missile defense system to be deployed, this legislation more properly lays out broad U.S. policy. The bill simply--but clearly--calls for deployment of an effective system once the technology is possible. No date for deployment is set. No requirement for a specific type of ballistic missile defense is outlined. By not dictating such requirements, this legislation responsibly allows for flexibility for our military experts to develop and deploy the best possible missile defense system. This language helps ensure that the United State will not rush into deployment with a substandard system--at a cost of billions of taxpayer dollars--just to be able to say we've deployed a limited missile defense. 
   Instead, this legislation will help ensure that the United States has deployed a system that has been thoroughly tested and proven operationally effective. I fully support this flexible approach. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly address the issue of cost. A lot has been said about how the original draft of this legislation could have bypassed future deliberations about how much the Pentagon should spend on missile defense. In effect, many critics of this legislation believed this bill would simply be providing a blank check for all future missile defense development and deployment efforts. I don't believe that is the case. This legislation does not preclude such important funding deliberations. However, I was very glad to support the amendment that Senator COCHRAN offered yesterday to make it absolutely explicit that Congress will fully debate the cost implications of a missile defense system in all annual defense authorizations and appropriations proceedings in the future. I plan to fully weigh the costs and benefits of missile defense in comparison to all other defense programs and to assess all potential threats to the United States at the time of those deliberations. 
   Finally, I am also pleased that the bill now calls for the United States to continue working with the Russians to reduce nuclear weapons. I strongly supported the amendment offered by Senator LANDRIEU which added this policy statement to S. 257. The United States and Russia have made great progress in reducing nuclear weapons over the past decade and both countries need to continue to do so. I think this statement of policy calling for continued efforts to reduce nuclear weapons is extremely important. We need to make it clear to ourselves, to all American citizens, to  our allies, and to the world that not only does the United States plan to defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile attacks, but that the best protection we can offer our nation is a world in which the fewest possible weapons of mass destruction exist. 
   Again, I thank Senator COCHRAN and all the cosponsors for introducing this important piece of legislation and for allowing the modifications to be made that garnered broad bipartisan support. I believe it is entirely appropriate for Congress to make it the policy of the United States to deploy an effective missile defense when technologically possible. The National Missile Defense Act will help allow this Government to keep its most important covenant with the American people--to protect their life and liberty.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as an original co-sponsor of S. 494, the Nursing Home Resident Protection Amendments of 1999, a bipartisan bill that would protect Medicaid patients from being dumped out of nursing homes in favor of patients who pay only through private funds. 
   When a senior citizen enters a nursing home facility he or she does so with the intention of making it their new home. It may not have the memories or immediate comfort level of the home they are used to, but for each elderly person that must enter a nursing home, they are exchanging the feelings of familiarity connected with their old home for the security and peace of mind that only comes with constant medical attention. In the recent past, some nursing home companies took actions that jettisoned these residents from the beds of their new homes based solely on their method of payment. Those who had the economic capability to pay with private funds were allowed to remain in the facility while those that needed governmental assistance in payment, paying with Medicaid dollars, were told to leave. 
   The eviction is not just a matter of the inconvenience of finding a new home, it is a matter of life and death. Studies show that death rates among nursing home patients who are transferred or evicted is two to three times higher than normal. 
   In some circumstances people were left without any real ``home'' to go to. Someone's method of payment should not determine whether or not they can continue to live in their new community or receive necessary medical attention. Once a facility has decided to accept a resident they should not be able to remove them based on whether they pay with private dollars or Medicaid. That is discrimination. Therefore, I decided to co-sponsor this bill and join the efforts of Senator BOB GRAHAM and others to prevent this discriminatory and traumatizing event from happening to even one more person. 
   I fully agree that the nursing home industry is a vital element in the continuum of care available to the elderly, and that a balance must be struck between encouraging private operators to  make the investment necessary to operate these vital facilities and protecting patients and their families from unfair treatment. The reality is that nursing homes are a business and it must be economically feasible for them to operate. However, once a nursing home accepts a patient they should fulfill their promise and allow the patient to remain a part of the nursing home community regardless of payment status. 
   This issue is of particular concern to me since Indiana seniors experienced this unfair treatment. Approximately sixty elderly patients from one nursing home facility in Indiana, Wildwood, were told to leave because of their method of payment. In some cases, after they had worked hard to save for their future and were forced to spend every dollar to support themselves in the nursing home. Even spending every dollar they saved did not ensure them security since, once that money was depleted and they received government assistance, they were told their money was not good enough to keep them in the facility. 
   Robyn Grant was the Indiana State Long-Term care Ombudsman for eight years. She recently testified on behalf of the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform before the House Subcommittee on Health and Environment in regard to this issue. Ms. Grant relayed the letter of a daughter of a resident who was evicted because they were paying with Medicaid. That woman wrote that ``You have destroyed lives and emotions and torn apart families. Yes, many of these people though not blood related, considered their companions and friends as family. Your facility was their home. Physical and emotional health was gravely endangered by the insensitive actions of the nursing home company.'' 
   Current law must be changed so there is no propensity for seniors to be torn apart from their newly found families in the future. 
   Nursing homes should have the ability to chose what payment programs in which they will participate. However, if a facility decides to accept Medicaid patients, they must uphold the promise they made to those seniors. This bill would prevent a nursing home that decides to withdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting residents who were accepted prior to the facility's withdrawal. In addition, if a facility is a private-pay only, it would be required to notify the resident upon her entrance to the facility that she could be evicted after her private funds were exhausted. The Nursing Home Resident Protection Amendments of 1999 would protect the 68% of nursing home residents who rely on Medicaid at some point during their stay. This bill will not cost anything, but will have a significant positive impact on the lives of seniors faced with the need to enter a nursing home. 
   We owe it to all our citizens to keep them informed and protected from discriminatory practices. This bill does that and I urge my colleagues to join us in turning this legislation into law.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. I am pleased to join with a bipartisan group that includes thirty-three of my colleagues and almost all of the nation's governors, to ensure that all states have the flexibility to encourage education reforms of the highest standards in our schools. This legislation enjoys the support of the National Education Association, the National School Board Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National Governors' Association. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the Ed-Flex Program was established in 1994 under the Goals 2000 Program. It originally authorized 6 states to participate in a demonstration program that would allow States the ability to waive certain Federal regulations and statutes for local school districts and schools in return for high standards and accountability. In 1996, Congress expanded the Ed-Flex Program in the Omnibus Appropriations Act to include six more states. While this waiver authority may seem broad, Ed-Flex States may only grant waivers for selected Federal programs. Most importantly, these states may not waive Federal requirements relating to health, safety, civil rights, parental involvement, allocation of funds, participation by pupils attending private schools, and fiscal accountability. 
   With over 14,000 school districts in this nation, there cannot be one education reform plan that fits every community. Ed-Flex allows states and local education agencies to commit to common goals and purposes and yet allows them to choose the best path to achieve these results. Ed-Flex is not a cure-all for education reform. It is just a common-sense, practical tool that allows local school districts and schools to get back to the business of educating our youth and away from the business of filling out forms. 
   Most waivers granted under Ed-Flex have dealt primarily with the use of Title I funds on a school-wide basis and the allocation of Eisenhower Professional Development Funds for teaching disciplines other than math and science. These are common sense changes that have allowed local school districts and schools to use Federal dollars in a smart and efficient manner. Ed-Flex has also encouraged several states to streamline their own regulations and statutes, thus providing their schools with better guidance and clarity on state requirements. 
   Some of the requirements of Federal programs have produced nonsensical results. For instance, in my home state of Indiana, the town of Elwood operates two separate elementary schools. One of these schools meets the 50 percent threshold for Title I so it can implement Title I programs school-wide. However, the other school just misses this threshold and must restrict Title I resources to only Title I students. That particular elementary school in Elwood, Indiana would be cited by the State Board of Accounts if they were to allow non-Title I students the use of their computer lab which was paid for with Title I funding. These Federal requirements have not only produced two systems of elementary education for this town, but has created confusion over what sort of educational programs can be implemented. This kind of strict regulation is not only absurd, but counterproductive to school reform. As long as Title I students are being targeted for additional assistance, there is no reason a school should be prohibited from sharing its resources with all of its students. In twelve states, Ed-Flex has allowed local education agencies and schools to operate Title I programs on a school-wide basis thus equalizing the standard of learning for all students. 
   Some have raised the issue that Ed-Flex does not address the major concerns of our nation's school districts. While Ed-Flex will not on its own solve our education problems, it can spur our States and schools to creatively approach old problems in a new way. As a former Governor, I know first-hand how easing strict Federal requirements can help states achieve positive results. Any school teacher will tell you that there is no one lesson plan from which to educate all of our nation's students. Just as each child is unique in his or her capacity to learn and grow, so too our are nation's school districts unique. No matter how well-intentioned, the Federal Government cannot continue down the path of a one-size fits all educational system for our nation's children. Education is now and will continue to be the primary responsibility of local communities and states. Educators, community leaders, and parents are the best judges of what is good education policy for their schools. Each community has different needs and by expanding the Ed-Flex Program, we can allow them to partner with the Federal Government to achieve some truly outstanding results. 
   For example, a Maryland school district was able to identify a trend in math and science performance of middle school students who came from two elementary schools. After looking at the assessment results and the demographic make-up of the student population, they were able to use the waiver authority to implement comprehensive planning and greater resource coordination. The result has been improved reading and math instruction for this school district's elementary and middle school students. 
   Our nation's schools will face many challenges in the next century. Dilapidated school buildings, overcrowding in the classrooms, and a shortage of qualified teachers will place great demands on our country's educational systems. While Ed-Flex alone will not solve all of these problems it can ease the burdens placed on our educators so they can rise to meet the challenges of the future. I am pleased to vote in favor of final passage of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act which expands this successful program so that all states, not just twelve, have the opportunity to waive Federal requirements that present an obstacle to innovation in their schools. 
   I thank Senators FRIST and WYDEN for re-introducing this effective tool of reform. I believe this bipartisan approach is a step in the right direction towards helping our nation's schools achieve positive results.

    Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join with my colleague Senator HAGEL to introduce the Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999. We are joined in this endeavor by Senators LOTT, KERREY, BENNETT, BRYAN, JOHNSON, GRAMS, CONRAD, BURNS, BROWNBACK, DEWINE, MURKOWSKI, ROBERTS, and INHOFE. 
   Let me begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to Senator HAGEL for spearheading this reform effort over the past two years. The Home Loan Bank System is not something that is on the lips of every Senator or every constituent and I commend him for mastering this difficult subject and for devising some changes that will allow this somewhat-obscure system to have a tangible positive impact upon the lives of people who might not even be aware that the system exists. 
   Mr. President, the core element of our legislative proposal today would be to allow community banks--defined as those institutions with assets of less than $500 million--to access the low cost capital of the Home Loan Bank System in order to make loans to small businesses, farmers and other types of loans that benefit their community. 
   These small banks generally serve rural communities and small cities. The plain fact is that while, overall, the national economy is robust, there is still demand for credit and capital in rural communities that cannot be met by the existing financial structure. These communities, unfortunately, do not always attract the attention of the large banks and securities firms that have come to dominate the financial landscape. And since the community banks that serve these communities are constrained in the amount of lending they can do by the amount of deposits that they can raise from a limited geographic area, fueling economic growth requires us to develop additional sources of private sector funding. 
   By opening up the Home Loan Bank System to these small, community banks, this legislation will, hopefully, not only allow the banks to meet the  loan demand of their town or small city, but will also have the added effect of keeping interest rates down--or even lowering those rates--for these kind of loans. 
   Let me also emphasize, Mr. President, that these benefits will accrue to these communities without a single dime of taxpayer money. Making these changes to the Home Loan Bank System frees up access to capital using existing private sector mechanisms. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly outline why it is necessary for Congress to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and why opening up the system to these small banks is consistent with the mission that Congress endowed the system with in 1932. 
   The Federal Home Loan Bank System was created in 1932 to serve as a public/private mechanism that would both regulate the thrift (S&L) industry and would help the industry obtain low-cost capital for the purpose of making home mortgages (at the time, the primary mission of Savings & Loans). Borrowing by the individual home loan banks is backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government, thus allowing them to borrow at the lowest possible rates. In turn, the bank makes that money available to its members in the form of ``advances.'' 
   In 1989, as part of the clean-up of the S&L crisis, the Home Loan Bank System was dramatically changed. It was stripped of its regulatory authority (which was transferred to the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision) and of its authority to administer the deposit insurance fund (called FSLIC at the time and which was transferred to the FDIC which now administers the SAIF). The banks retained authority to provide low-cost capital to the thrift industry, though membership was also opened up to commercial banks. A Federal Housing Finance Board was created specifically to make sure that the activities of the 12 banks--which were still controlled by their members--conformed to safety and soundness regulations. 
   The Banks were also required to buy REFCORP bonds. As a result, the banks must pay a total of $300 million each year out of their earnings. The banks must also pay $100 million each year as part of the Affordable Housing Program. The REFCORP formula required a payment of a certain percentage of each banks annual earnings; if that failed to meet the annual $300 million payment, a further allocation system went into place with the heaviest burden placed on those banks with the greatest number of S&L failures. 
   This legislation keeps in place all of the safety and soundness regulations put into place by FIRREA and FDICIA. But it would reform some of the basic management of the individual banks so that basic administrative decisions are placed in the hands of the men and women running the bank, rather than emanating from the Finance Board here in Washington. The bill also seeks to rationalize the capital structure of the individual banks so that the need to engage in non-advance investments is reduced and so that banks' capital reserves are secured by permanent--rather than tradeable--stock. 
   With the rise of the secondary mortgage market--primarily driven by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--and the entry of other entities like mortgage brokers into the mortgage market, many people have been looking for ways to allow the banks to play a more relevant role in today's society. Expanding the Home Loan Banks ability to provide low-cost capital to the smallest banks in principally rural areas is both a benefit to the banks and to communities that are still experiencing a credit crunch. 
   In 1932, Congress correctly surmised that creating funding for housing was the cornerstone of rebuilding towns, villages and cities gripped in the vise of the Great Depression. Today, with the housing market flush with capital, it is appropriate for Congress to use this longstanding tool of community development--the Federal Home Loan Bank System--to address the pressing and serious capital needs of rural America. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with Senator HAGEL and myself to work towards enactment of this important legislation.

   Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the State tobacco settlement protection bill, a bill to protect state tobacco settlement funds from seizure by the federal government. I want to thank Senators HUTCHISON and GRAHAM for their leadership on this issue. I stand today for fiscal responsibility, local control and fairness. I stand today to protect our children's health, to assist those who have become addicted to tobacco. 
   This is really about fairness. Is it fair for the federal government, having sat on the sidelines during this uphill battle against Big Tobacco, to come in after the fact and claim a large share of the victory? If nothing else, this proves the old adage that victory has many parents, while defeat is an orphan. 
   I have said repeatedly that the federal government does not have all the answers. Much of what has gone right in this country in the last several years is a direct result of moving decisions and power out of this city and into small towns and communities. I came to Washington to stand up for what is right, to protect Indiana's values, and to speak up when the federal government oversteps its bounds. 
   Does the federal government have a right to take more than 60% of Indiana's tobacco settlement to spend on federal priorities? Absolutely not. Indiana's share of the settlement is $4 billion over 25 years, but the federal government's claim could take two and a half billion away. While the President's budget acknowledges the difficulty in collecting this money in the coming fiscal year, I am disappointed they have laid claim to a substantial share of state settlement funds in their budget for use on federal discretionary programs in years to come. The fiscally responsible approach is to ensure this money is spent wisely at the local level, not to allow it to be dumped into the black pit of the federal bureaucracy in Washington. 
   Indiana began this fight to protect our kids from the dangers of an addictive, life-threatening habit. The State fought a lonely battle, without any federal assistance and invested considerable resources in prosecuting this case. 
   The Governor of Indiana, Frank O'Bannon, is in the planning stages for using this money to improve public health, promote teen smoking cessation programs and children's health  care, the purposes originally outlined in the lawsuit. But with more than 60% of the funds at risk it is hard to sketch out a reliable plan. 
   The confrontation between states and the federal government that would result from an attempt by the Health Care Financing Administration to take these state settlement funds would only hurt the people in each of our states. It would tie us up in needless court actions over who has the legal right to these funds. That is wasted time. While the courts decide what to do with the funds, we lose the opportunity to cover uninsured children, start anti-smoking campaigns and improve the lives of Hoosiers and the people in all our states. 
    Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues become a part of this bipartisan coalition. I hope we can all--Democrats and Republicans, States and the federal government--work together to ensure these funds are used in the states to improve health, deter smoking and educate kids about the dangers of this addiction. I look forward to working to pass this very important legislation this year.
