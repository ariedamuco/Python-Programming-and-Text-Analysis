   Mr. BOND. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee is correct. That reference is specifically intended to refer to Catholic Social Services for renovations and construction at the Brother Francis Shelter and AWAIC's transitional housing and was inadvertently referred to as Catholic Community Services. I hope the RECORD will reflect this clarification and will result in an expeditious use of the funds.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my former gubernatorial colleague. There are far too few of us former Governors in this body, and it was my pleasure to serve with the Governor from Florida, who is now the Senator from Florida. 
   It is a very melancholy time for me to rise today to pay my respects and honor and to offer sincerest thanks to a friend who is probably my closest colleague in politics. We have been through a lot together. I lost a couple races as well as winning some. I can tell you, it is not fun. In fact, it is really terrible. I know what it is like.  
   After my last loss, a good friend came up to me and slapped me on the shoulder and said: Well, experience is what you get when you are expecting to get something else. 
   I don't know what that proves, but I have had experience, and I know JOHN has had experience. It hasn't made him bitter. Every time he has had an experience, it has made him better. 
   Last night I had the pleasure of joining him for ceremonies at a Christmas celebration to collect toys for tots in the Marine Corps effort. Now, there was some singing. And the host who heard both of us sing sort of gave me a speaking role and gave JOHN the responsibility to lead the singing. There is no question that I will not try to take his place in the Singing Senators. That is going to be a loss. 
   But there are a lot of other ideas, a lot of other fond memories that come back to me. When JOHN ASHCROFT followed me in the State auditor's office, he continued the effort to clean up the mess of the State auditor's office, something I chided him about frequently. He went on to be attorney general, my second term as Governor. During his first time, I had taken an involuntary hiatus from the Governor's office. I had one of my 
   experiences. 
   I came back and he was my counsel, my lawyer, kept me out of trouble for 4 years. Then he served 8 great years as a very effective and farsighted Governor of the State of Missouri. I will not impose on the Senate's time to go down the list of accomplishments. 
   One of my favorite programs is Parents as Teachers. This is a wonderful early childhood program that has revolutionized early childhood education in Missouri. We managed to get it on the books and kind of bring it to life. But JOHN ASHCROFT was the one who funded it, nurtured it, encouraged it, made it flourish to become a national model and even an international model. It has gone to six or seven other countries, last time I heard, because it works. And because of his strong leadership, it was successful. 
   With his long experience in Missouri, it is no surprise that when he came to Washington he said he was going to Washington not to bring Washington ideas back to Missouri but to bring Missouri values, views, and good ideas to Washington. He has clearly done that. 
   There are many accomplishments we could cite about his service. He has mentioned a few of them. The methamphetamine problem became a very serious problem in Missouri in the early 1990s. We worked together, he on the Judiciary Committee, fashioning laws. He helped me secure appropriations to deal with this scourge. It was a terrible tragedy for too many Missourians. His work on behalf of ending the food and medicine embargo was just one more step in opening the markets that our farmers and, indeed, our entire world economy needs so they can be healthy from the export markets. 
   Working together at the staff level, we had great staff efforts. I express my thanks to his staff as well because we worked jointly together and managed to do a lot of good. We sincerely appreciate the service the staff has provided. 
   We fought the battles. I should note for our colleagues who are not soon going to forget our efforts on behalf of the Missouri River, we appreciate their indulgence. That issue of controlled flooding on the Missouri River was very important to our State, and we fought that battle. We appreciate the suffering of our fellow Senators. 
   There is no better measure of a man than how he handles adversity. It is something you don't want to experience but when you do, how do you react? Do you get bitter or do you get better? JOHN ASHCROFT showed the nobility, the character, and the honor that has been his trademark throughout. 
   When he conceded the election and there were those who wished to mount a legal challenge, he wasn't going to stand for it. He would not tolerate it. The people of Missouri had spoken. He views his job as one of service to the people of Missouri--not one of using legal challenges and court challenges to try to win what the polls had shown. 
   I can tell you that as I have traveled around the State there is one overwhelming message Missourians have; that is, thank you, JOHN ASHCROFT. Their esteem for you has grown. People shake their heads, and say: Why didn't he fight? Why didn't he do something? I said: Look. He wants service to go forward. They are very proud of the nobility he showed. But they are confident, as I am, that new opportunities will be arising for him. They wish him well--with his experience, commitment, and his solid faith. 
   There will be many areas where JOHN ASHCROFT will serve. He has too much to offer. And I look forward too--I admit--with awfully mixed emotions to seeing him take a new role and new responsibilities. 
   On behalf of my fellow citizens of Missouri, I say thanks for the first 33 years of service to the State. We are not finished with you yet. There is a lot more to be done, and you are the one to do it. 
   For me personally, I know what you and Janet have gone through. And I am very proud of the way you have handled it. Your friendship will always mean a great deal to me, and the shared time that we have had together in this body is particularly special. 
   When they close the service and the benediction at my church in Missouri, the minister says: The service is over, and now it is time for the work to begin. For JOHN, the service is over for now right here. But let the work begin. 
   JOHN, thank you from the bottom of my heart, and very best wishes to you, Janet, and your family. 
   I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague from Missouri.

   Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator and agree without reservation that the purpose of this legislation is to increase safety on the highways. No one in the small business community supports allowing defective auto parts or automobiles to be allowed on the road. After all, small businesses, their employees, and their owners are some of the drivers of the vehicles that would be identified under this law, and they are the other drivers on the road with these vehicles. They care as much as anyone else about highway safety. Without question, the safety of our roadways is one of our highest priorities. 
   I would just like to add one clarification. When the Department of Transportation promulgates the regulations required by this act, it is required under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) to determine whether the regulations will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' If the regulations rise to that level, the Department is required to conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and a final regulatory flexibility analysis as described in SBREFA so that the impacts on small businesses can be identified and better understood. None of the requirements under SBREFA are intended to, or have been shown to, interfere in any way with an agency's regulatory objectives. In this case they would not impede, in any way, the Department of Transportation's ability to provide the maximum safety improvement on the highways as mandated under the TREAD Act. 
   This is the current law and is consistent with the provision in the TREAD Act which prohibits the Department of Transportation from issuing unnecessarily burdensome regulations. I just want to make it clear that we will be watching closely to make sure that the Department of Transportation adheres to the mandates of SBREFA.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ms. Judy England-Joseph who retired from the General Accounting Office, GAO, this past March. Her departure from federal service is a great loss to the federal government as well as to all offices in the Senate. Judy was a superlative federal employee with a record of honesty and integrity as well as a commitment to a job well done. 
   Ms. England-Joseph had been with GAO since 1975 working on a number of important federal issues in the fields of personnel and compensation, human resources, and energy, to name a few. However, I think most of my colleagues would agree that Judy's most outstanding contributions came as the Director of Housing and Community Development Issues at GAO. As Director, she had the primary responsibility for overseeing for the Congress the audit and evaluation of all programs and activities at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including those concerning housing, community and economic development, and federal disaster responsibilities. 
   As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies and the Committee on Small Business, I found Judy to be an invaluable resource for objective and timely information that was critical to fulfilling my responsibilities. Judy not only testified numerous times before my appropriations subcommittee and the Committee on Small Business, but also personally met with me and my staff to discuss pressing issues and provide us with the critical information needed to make policy decisions. Judy was more than a resource to my committees; I also viewed her as a teammate and partner who shared my goal of making government truly accountable and as efficient as possible. 
   To say that we miss Judy would be an understatement. Judy epitomized public service. Her energy was boundless, her knowledge of policy issues was rarely matched, and her commitment to doing the right thing underlined her approach to her job and responsibilities. 
   I am honored to have worked with Judy and commend her for the years of service she provided to the Congress and the American Taxpayer.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to call to the attention of my colleagues and the many people across this Nation the fact that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has rushed to judgment and published a huge, extremely burdensome ergonomics rule. They had talked about this previously with bipartisan support. We had included in the Labor-HHS bill, as well as others, legislative vehicles stating that they should not go forward with this measure because of the burdens it imposed. I have in my hand the voluminous computer printout of the rule. I chair the small business committee, and I can just see the thrill and excitement with which a small business will view this rule coming down on their backs. 
   I hope this body can take action to stop the implementation of this rule  until OSHA itself and the scientific evidence can provide real guidance to small business and other businesses on how to reduce ergonomics injuries. 
   In the last 7 years, the incidence of ergonomics injuries has gone down by a third--26 percent in carpal tunnel syndrome and 33 percent in tendonitis. It is in the interest of employers and employees to reduce to the greatest extent possible the very painful, time-consuming and profit-consuming impact of ergonomics injuries. 
   Well, OSHA decided they had been working on this for a long time and they wanted to get something out the door before the Clinton administration left office. Our political friends said we have to have an ergonomics rule. This overrules State workers compensation laws and tells employees if they have an ergonomics injury, they can collect more workers comp than the State provides them. We are overruling State workers comp laws. 
   It also tells employees that if you get an ergonomics injury--say you are in a bowling league on your own time, or you are crocheting in the evening and you come up with an ergonomics injury--if that is made worse by the job that you are doing, then your employer has had it. This ergonomics rule doesn't give any sound guidelines on how employers and employees working together can reduce ergonomics injuries. That is what we need from OSHA, not a punitive measure which says if somebody has an ergonomics injury, you are dead; your workers comp account is going to be held hostage and you are going to be subject to lawsuits. 
   All this says is, that if the highway speed limit sign says don't drive too fast and you are driving down the road at what you think is a reasonable speed and a State trooper flags you over and says: You know what, you were going 40 miles an hour, and I think 35 miles an hour is a reasonable speed, so you are guilty. That is precisely what they propose to do with this ergonomics regulation, and it affects businesses of all sizes. 
   I have talked to soft drink distributors who say: If we don't go out of business, we are going to have to buy equipment and get rid of employees to have machines doing the work. You can talk to people in the delivery business--express delivery or any other delivery business--and they know that no matter what they try to do, even if they continue to reduce the incidence of ergonomics injuries, any time there is an ergonomics injury, they are going to be held responsible even if they didn't initially cause it. Well, we have the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act and we have lawsuits that are about to be filed by many organizations representing small business. I support those lawsuits. I hope this body can act to stop the implementation of this draconian rule. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me begin by noting a point made by the Senator from Texas. I urge all colleagues to change their plans to be here for the vote at 3 p.m. I believe there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle with planes to catch. The sooner we can complete the vote at 3 o'clock, the sooner we will be able to go on to the second vote, and there are many colleagues on both sides who hear the engines warming up and smell the jet fuel. 
   Mr. President, before I talk about this bill in particular, we have had a lot of politics on the floor and that is where I think it is appropriate for us to have our political discussions. I think, as chairman of the Small Business Committee, we have been able to work on a bipartisan basis on small business issues. But something is very disturbing to me, and I want to call that to the attention of my colleagues and to a much broader constituency. It is something that appears to be an attempt by this administration to politicize the Small Business Administration just days before the national election this November. 
   I call on the SBA Administrator to stop this effort. Yesterday, an anonymous employee of the Small Business Administration faxed to my office a draft of the ``SBA Day Plan.'' It was faxed to the Small Business Committee staff. 
   According to the plan, in the week before the election, the SBA will use personnel from its district offices to conduct a nationwide blitz of making small business loans, releasing media statements on the Clinton-Gore administration accomplishments, and coordinating advertising with 5,000 lending partners across the country. The whistleblower who contacted us had one short message: ``This must be stopped.'' I agree. This must be stopped. 
   According to this SBA document, SBA allegedly plans a major public relations campaign in the first days of November, right before the election. SBA central office will make mention of the hundreds of events going on all over the country. SBA regional and district offices will publicize their local SBA Day events throughout their regions. 
   What wonderful timing. Does anybody want to guess what those days will feature? Do you think they will mention the name of the Vice President? 
   Well, more disturbingly, SBA district offices will enlist and co-opt volunteers from the Small Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, SCORE Chapters, and U.S. Export Assistance Centers, to place at least one person in lender offices in branches throughout the country in the week before the election. I say co-opt because these SBDC, SCORE, USEAC, and WBC centers receive a substantial amount of funding from SBA. It appears that the SBA may be using their private sector partners' dependence on SBA funding as leverage, pushing them to carry out this SBA campaign plan. 
   SBA partners are expected to encourage local lenders to make joint media announcements with SBA. SBA private sector partners are also expected to coordinate advertising regarding the SBA Plan Day at their local offices.  
   In particular, SBA district offices [are to] make every effort to target lender offices in key communities (i.e., Hispanic, African American, Asian, Native American, Export, Women).  
   The most abusive part of this plan would be SBA's efforts to ``close or get commitments for as many new SBA-guaranteed loans as possible during the week of October 30 through November 3, 2000.'' A followup news release, of course, will publicize the success of this effort. 
   Is this a great country or what? When I read this plan, I was shocked at what I saw. This thinly veiled attempt by the administration to promote itself in the days before the election is an abomination. Too many of us worked too long to allow the political manipulation and abuse of SBA resources, SBA personnel, and SBA partners with the goal of influencing the election. 
   As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I, along with the committee, have worked tirelessly on a bipartisan basis to promote small business development and success. This entire Senate has worked on fostering small business growth as a top priority on a bipartisan basis. 
   Focusing the resources of the SBA and its programs and loans towards historically disadvantaged and underutilized communities has also been a chief goal. This Senate passed the HUBZone Program overwhelmingly. It is now part of the SBA's programs to bring opportunity to areas of high unemployment and poverty. We cannot and should not allow SBA, in the waning days of this administration, to be politically hijacked for an election. Staging the events in the days before the election would spread a political taint throughout the SBA. This campaign plan will undermine the credibility of every SBA employee and partner. I don't want to see that political destruction. 
   If SBA is serious about raising public awareness of SBA programs and services--and I think that is a good thing to do--then it will do one simple thing: Delay the SBA Day Plan for 1 month. They can begin it in December instead of November. That would avoid any hint of impropriety. If however, SBA continues with the SBA Day Plan in the days before the election, we have no choice but to conclude that a complete political takeover of SBA had occurred with a goal of advancing the administration's candidates in the November election. 
   I don't know if this SBA pre-election campaign has been coordinated with the national political campaign or local political campaigns across the country. Frankly, we don't need to know, if this issue can be taken off the table right now. I urge SBA to remove any doubts and postpone this action. I have written to Administrator Aida Alvarez urging her to protect SBA from the taint of political interference.

We intend to be around to continue oversight responsibilities next year, and we will ensure that there is no reprisal against any SBA employee or non-SBA employee who chooses not to participate in a political endeavor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are about ready to conclude the debate on this portion of the omnibus small business. 
   Let me point out before we go to the votes on District of Columbia/Commerce-State-Justice and adopt the resolution numbered 245, there has been a lot of talk about all of these things not having passed. Ninety percent of the bill has been voted out of the House by a large margin, and parts have come out of the Finance Committee. 
   I can tell you from the Small Business Committee that we took a bipartisan, broadly supported bill, and we were not able to get all of the things that we in the Senate wanted included. Frankly, one of the key elements I wanted was rejected. I know a provision advocated by the Senator from Minnesota was rejected. But I can assure you that it was over my strong objections, and only at the last was it rejected. 
   This measure does many things to continue the small business programs and to assure small businesses can provide jobs in areas where there are great needs when there is poverty and unemployment. There are provisions that are recommended by the Women's Business Conference. There are provisions to bring jobs into needy low-income communities. These bills together have many of the things that the President also requested. 
   I regret to say that the President and some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are pouting because they didn't get it all. I can tell you something. I didn't get all that I wanted in this bill either. I took some things I didn't want, that were wanted by the House and that were wanted by other Members. 
   But this bill provides significant savings incentives and income-limited savings incentives on IRAs that could do more to help savings. 
   Medicare give-backs will enable providers to continue to serve needy people. 
   Those who ran against the HMOs are trying to make HMOs available in States such as New Mexico and rural areas that do not have the tremendous bonanza of the reimbursements that they do in New York State. 
   There are many good provisions in this bill. An overwhelming number of them have been supported and requested by the President and, at one time or another, supported by the people on the other side of the aisle. Unfortunately, they say: We are just not getting enough. Sixteen billion dollars in school construction, two-thirds of what the President wanted, is not enough. Our friends have never seen a tax cut that they liked nor a tax surplus they didn't want to spend. 
   This strikes the happy medium. I hope ultimately we will adopt this measure and have it signed by the President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The Small Business Committee, which I chair, has invested considerable time and effort working on this issue. While we have made much progress, many of the facts surrounding this practice remain shrouded, and little hard data has been produced to gauge slotting's impact, especially on small businesses and small farmers. For example, at a recent hearing, the General Accounting Office reported it has been unable to collect data needed to prepare a thorough analysis of the practice. The FTC, however, would have the legal authority under Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to collect the data necessary to continue with a full and complete analysis of these practices and their impacts. 
   This funding was requested for the purpose of the FTC preparing a comprehensive report to Congress, pursuant to Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that outlines the appropriate policy considerations arising from this issue. The report should concentrate on industry-wide practices of retailers that engage in the sale of grocery items with respect to slotting allowances and other similar practices including, without limitation: Their impact on competition and retail prices; their impact on all forms of grocery retailing, including smaller grocery retailers; their impact on manufacturers and suppliers; and their relationship to consolidation in the retail grocery industry.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address two issues that are related; first, to express support for one of the most lethal and effective foreign policy instruments we know; that is, our brave service men and women who are standing guard on distant shores. We were reminded of that recently by the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen. It was yet another reminder that our forces are on watch 24 hours a day in farflung places many of us have never heard of. Their presence and service is a crucial component of foreign policy. 
   The effort of the sailors aboard the U.S.S. Cole in saving the ship is a testimony to the honor, courage, and commitment the Navy expects from every sailor wearing the Navy uniform. 
   Our thanks and our congratulations go to them; our sorrow, of course, for those who were lost; and our sympathies and prayers go with their families. 
   But in light of the danger in which these fighting men and women of the United States are placed, it is important we assess our foreign policy, and that we take a look at the record of what has happened in the past. 
   What have the two candidates done? Where would the Vice President lead us, based on his experience to date? 
   When you talk about experience with respect to Vice President GORE's foreign policy, I am reminded of that old saw that ``experience is what you get when you expected to get something else.'' His record of experience has been a very bad one, and one that will put at risk other sailors and other U.S. military in the future. You don't need to look too far to share these concerns. 
   First, let me call attention to a Wall Street Journal editorial page article, ``Gore's Hidden Weakness: Foreign Policy'' from Monday, October 23. There Robert Zoellick expresses concern over the supposed foreign policy experience that Vice President GORE would bring to the White House. 
   In the article he said that in the Chernomyrdin agreement:  
   ..... he blessed Russian exports to Iran of weapons that could only be targeted against the U.S. Navy, which protects the world's energy lifeline.  
   He went on to say:  
   ..... Russian technicians continued to help Iran develop ``laser isotope separation technology'' used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.  
   This was to a country that the State Department called ``the most active state sponsor of terrorism.'' We would have hoped that our Vice President, in his agreements with Mr. Chernomyrdin, would have been trying to build a market economy based on the rule of law. He should have prodded them to close down the corrupt commissions. But what we seem to have seen, as a result, or what has followed on that agreement, was a Soviet-style bureaucracy that never made any progress. 
   There was an admission that the IMF money went to foreigners and Russian speculators. 
   Quoting the editorial further, the former chairman of Russia's security commission said:  
   ``I cannot explain why the Western governments didn't pay serious attention.'' And Anatoly Chubais, Mr. Chernomyrdin's deputy, said pithily: ``We conned them out of $20 billion.''  
   And the editorial writer, Mr. Zoellick, says:  
   Mr. Gore's Russian record is more than a litany of costly mistakes. The vice president was unable to either perceive the true nature of Russia's transformation or to design creative U.S. policy to match the circumstances.  
   I think we ought to be alarmed. We ought to be alarmed at the record that Vice President GORE has written as he takes credit for our foreign policy with Russia. 
   Is it really credit, when we find that the Russians continue to export arms to Iran? Would it alarm Americans that Iran, which relies on Russian arms sales to maintain its own military, sends arms also to Hezbollah's guerrillas in Lebanon, which uses those same arms against Israeli soldiers in settlements? 
   Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations began hearings to probe the recent press reports that Vice President AL GORE and the Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made a secret agreement 5 years ago promising the Clinton White House would not enforce the law requiring sanctions for Russian sales to Iran. 
   Is this what we can expect, secret deals with Russia that have not stopped the sales of dangerous weapons to Iran? We are still seeking disclosure to the appropriate committees of Congress of the details of the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement. 
   They have not come forward even to give the committees of jurisdiction the details on that agreement. What is going on? Why is it being hidden? 
   I think we all ought to be very much concerned about what appears to be a series of deadly mistakes covered up--covered up--and kept out of the view of the congressional committees. 
   Now, portions of the 12-page agreement between Vice President GORE and Mr. Chernomyrdin appeared in the October 17 edition of the Washington Times. In there, it appeared that the U.S. Vice President committed our country to ``avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.'' The final document reads: ``This aide memoire, as well as the attached annexes, will remain strictly confidential.'' 
   This secret Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement, and the Clinton-Gore administration's promise not to implement U.S. laws requiring sanctions for Russian weapons proliferation to Iran, was first reported in the New York Times on October 13 of this year. It said there that:  
   In exchange for the Russian promises, the United States pledged not to seek penalties against Russia under a 1992 law that requires sanctions against countries that sell advanced weaponry to countries the State Department classifies as state sponsors of terrorism. Iran is on that list.  
   The law they are referring to, of course, is the 1992 Iran-Iraq Non-Proliferation Act. That was sponsored by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. AL GORE, along with Senator MCCAIN. 
   Let's be clear. This law requires the President impose sanctions on countries that sell advanced weaponry or assist in nuclear weapons programs in countries sponsoring terrorism. Russian cooperation with Iran's nuclear program was a major concern behind enactment of that legislation. How do you get around that? 
   The White House has attempted to downplay the impact of Vice President GORE's deal by arguing the weaponry transferred was ``antiquated.'' 
   I see nothing antiquated about laser isotope separation technology, which was described in the Wall Street Journal article, being used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. 
   It is my understanding that some of the weapons sold to Iran by Russia included the Kilo-class submarine, which is difficult to detect and track in the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf because they generate very little noise while operating on battery power. In the event of a crisis, these submarines would present a credible threat to U.S. forces, allied vessels, and merchant marine traffic. They also aid wake-homing torpedoes and antiship mines. If these weapons pose a significant threat to U.S. ships and forces in the region, then these transfers appear to me to meet the threshold for sanctions under the Gore-McCain Act. 
   Make no mistake, were tensions to escalate between the United States and countries in the Middle East, these weapons could have a catastrophic effect on our sailors and other military personnel on ships in the region. We just saw what a small simple boat loaded with explosives could do. What other reminders do we need. 
   The Vice President defends his actions claiming that none of the weapons included met the standard for triggering sanctions. Yet the Washington Times uncovered a letter sent last January to the Russian Foreign Minister by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitting:  
   Without the aid memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.  
   In classified documents obtained by the Washington Times, a 1995 letter, apparently written by Mr. Chernomyrdin to Vice President GORE, said:   
   The information we are passing on to you is not to be conveyed to third parties, including the U.S. Congress. Open information concerning our cooperation with Iran is obviously a different matter, and we do not object to the constructive use of such information. I am counting on your understanding.  
   These secret agreements between the Vice President and Mr. Chernomyrdin took place in the context of a Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which began in 1993 and was conducted in twice yearly meetings until Mr. Chernomyrdin was removed from his position in 1998. These secret agreements contradict administration and Vice President GORE's concerns regarding the spread of dangerous missiles in the Middle East and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to a country such as Iran who exports terrorism. 
   Former Secretaries of State and Defense, Directors of Central Intelligence, National Security Advisers, have put out a strong letter, dated October 24, saying in part:  
   This is why we are deeply disturbed by the agreement made by Vice President Gore and then Russian Premier Chernomyrdin in which America acquiesced in the sale by Russia to Iran of highly threatening military equipment such as modern submarines, fighter planes, and wake-homing torpedoes. 
   We also find incomprehensible that this agreement was not fully disclosed even to those committees of Congress charged with receiving highly classified briefings--apparently at the request of the Russian Premier. But agreement to his request is even more disturbing since the Russian sales could have brought about sanctions against Russia in accordance with a 1992 U.S. law sponsored by Senator John McCain and then Senator Al Gore.  
   This letter was signed by George Schultz, Jim Baker, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Frank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, James Schlesinger, Brent Scowcroft, Caspar Weinberger, and James Woolsey. I think their concerns ought to be concerns of all of us. 
   This foreign policy effort is part and parcel with Vice President GORE's approach to the people. Who does the Vice President trust. Apparently not the people, not the U.S. Congress. 
   The reason we are here discussing this issue is because exactly 13 days ago the New York Times revealed that Vice President GORE signed this secret agreement I have been discussing. This Gore-Chernomyrdin deal has broad foreign policy ramifications. The decision to allow Russia to escape the consequences of providing Iran with conventional weapons is one which affects the security of our allies and more importantly the security of our troops such as those who routinely patrol the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. This is not the type of agreement which should have been kept from the American people. 
   In closing, I find it unconscionable that the Vice President of the United States could willingly withhold information from the Congress regarding the sale of arms from Russia to Iran; to a state described by his own administration as ``the most active state sponsor of terrorism.'' I find it highly disturbing knowing the difficulties we have faced in this region over the years that the Vice President would willingly hide from the people a deal that puts in the hands of the Iranian government weapons that could do real harm to our forces in the region who routinely patrol the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Our forces put their lives at risk any time they enter this region of the world because tensions are so high. Is it unrealistic to ask that the Government that sends our military forces into harm's way would work at decreasing the availability of arms in the region that could potentially be used against them? 
   Is it unrealistic to expect from our President and Vice President sufficient trust in the people and our form of government to convey information to the Congress critical to our national security, critical to the security of our allies and critical to the stability of a region of the world that is wrought with tension and hatred for our allies such as Israel? I think not. I urge my fellow citizens to not simply accept the spin by supporters of Vice President GORE that his foreign policy experience is necessarily good for America and the troops we send in harm's way to enforce it. 
   I urge this body to take action to get copies of that agreement from the administration. We should demand it. We should subpoena it. I hope my colleagues will joint me in seeking that resolution.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am going to make some comments about the conference report that is before us, but perhaps it would be advisable to set the record straight. I agreed to allow the minority leader to go first as a courtesy to him. There are many things he said that I believe reflect a viewpoint many of us on this side of the aisle do not share. 
   I would only note that when we talk about bipartisanship, it was our understanding that the leadership on both sides, for example, agreed we would get 10 appropriations bills passed out of the Senate before the July recess. Due to the extensive debate and extended dilatory activities engaged in on this floor prior to our August recess, to get something like the fifth, sixth, and seventh bill before us, we had to invoke cloture. 
   Now, to me, that is not a mark of good bipartisan cooperation. We have been stalled for many months. There have been examples where we have worked on a bipartisan basis. 
   In another role, I express my appreciation to my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle for getting our Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development bill passed. I think we have worked on a bipartisan basis there. 
   But with the problems we are having with the appropriations bills, the problems we are having throughout, I do not think the other side can say we have been the ones who have refused to operate in a bipartisan manner. 
   I heard reports from the majority leader, for example, of the contacts made to him by the President of the United States, a Democratic President, about this bill and about the measures in it. 
   If you look at this bill, a lot on my side of the aisle do not like it because it has so many of the priorities that our Democratic friends wanted. If this were strictly a Republican or a partisan bill, I do not think you would see  the minimum wage in its current form; you would not see the community renewal, a massive new Federal Government program. 
   Frankly, with all the spending the President has requested in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill--and the President is now requesting more spending in that bill than his initial budget request--to add, as this bill does, some $16 billion for school construction, which is two-thirds of the President's request, I think is a major step towards helping in this new area, which traditionally has been the responsibility of the local school districts. 
   We have heard there is a desire for more and more spending. That is not surprising. That is the habit of our friends on the other side of the aisle. They have never seen a tax surplus they did not want to spend. Tax cuts are very unpalatable to them. But we want to leave some of the taxes in the pockets of the people who earn them. 
   I have not seen the figures--I do not know the study the minority leader came up with to say that 60 percent only get 5 percent of the tax cuts--but I think, if my memory serves me correctly, the lowest income 40 percent of the population do not pay any income taxes. I imagine the lowest 60 percent probably pay not more than a couple of percent of the total tax burden. 
   Now that is not to say there has not been some fuzzy math with respect to the figures we presented, but only to say that if you are going to have tax cuts, the people who get the tax cuts are going to be the people who pay the taxes. It sounds logical, sounds simple, but that is the fact of the matter. 
   I might add, also, that small rural school districts will be benefited in school construction because their exemption has been raised from $10 million to $15 million. 
   When we hear talk that the Democrats have not had anything to say about this, the tax bill includes bills that have already been voted on and passed, been voted out of the House, been voted out of the Finance Committee. Certainly the small business portion of the bill, which I am going to talk about, has been passed, as usual, out of the Small Business Committee on a unanimous vote, a bipartisan vote. 
   If I remember correctly, when the bills that are included in the small business section came before this body, there was only one dissenting vote, and that was on my side of the aisle. 
   But if there is ever a bipartisan measure, it is the measures we have reported out of the Small Business Committee. 
   On the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, when the House passed the pension bill earlier this year, it was a vote of 401-25. It was reported out of the Finance Committee last month by a unanimous vote. I was not there for the vote, but I assume there were some Democrats there--there usually are--who voted for it unanimously. 
   So it stretches credulity beyond any acceptable measure to say that this does not incorporate measures adopted and supported by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--certainly measures demanded by the President. 
   We had a caucus on our side, and many people thought it would be difficult to vote for a bill because there were so many priorities from the Democratic side. But under the measure that has come before us, there are clearly many important Democratic 
   priorities. 
   Excuse me, I misspoke a few moments ago when I indicated what the percentage of total taxes was paid by the lowest income taxpayers. The lowest income taxpayers, the bottom 56 percent pay 6 percent of the taxes. So that is roughly the figure.

   Mr. BOND. Let me move to the bill before us. It has been thoroughly covered with faint praise. Maybe it deserves a hearing in its own right before this thing gets pasted all over the place. I would like my colleagues and our constituents to know what is in it because I think there are some good things in it. 
   The conference report on H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Program Improvement Act, has grown over the past week to include not only a 3-year reauthorization bill for the Small Business Administration, but it includes extensive tax legislation, provisions to reform and improve the Medicare program, and, as I mentioned, pension reform. We might call this bill ``Small Business and Friends.'' A lot of important luggage is being carried on the train that our little small business bill is pulling. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I will comment first on the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000. This is, as I said before, the result of many months of work by the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. The bill is the conference agreement to reauthorize most small business programs at the Small Business Administration, and it reauthorizes the Small Business Innovation Research Program. 
   To summarize the provisions briefly, this includes an 8-year reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research Program, the SBIR Program. This program was initially implemented in 1983 and allows Federal agencies to award research grants and contracts to small research firms. This is vitally important to develop the capacity in the economy as a whole, and the country as a whole, to do high-quality research needed by the Federal Government. 
   Some 50,000 SBIR awards have been made since the inception of the program. It contains measures to ensure that small businesses receive the appropriate allocation of Federal R&D funds, to require that agencies retain more comprehensive information on the program's operations that will improve its management, and to protect the intellectual property of the small businesses that participate in the program. 
   The conference report also establishes what we call the FAST program, a matching grant initiative to provide incentives to States to assist in the development of high-tech small businesses. 
   We have noted, particularly those of us from the heartland, that companies on the east and west coasts generally receive the vast majority of SBIR awards, while companies in the South, Midwest, and Rocky Mountain States receive proportionally very few awards. Out in the heartland, we, too, have technology. We have research capabilities. The FAST program will help even out the concentration of the awards by providing wide latitude to States to provide the type of help their high-tech businesses need to succeed and create high-paying quality jobs for their citizens. 
   The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 also includes a comprehensive reauthorization of the credit and management assistance programs that are included in the broad umbrella of small business programs administered by the SBA. The omnibus bill includes the flagship 7(a) guaranteed business loan program, the Small Business Investment Company program, and the Microloan program. Certain improvements were made to the Microloan program championed by the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. JOHN KERRY. The Microloan program has been expanded. We also included aspects which will be especially beneficial to women-owned small businesses across the United States. 
   In addition, this extensive legislation would reauthorize and make improvements in the management assistance programs, including the SCORE and Small Business Development Center program. As a result of the continuing oversight responsibilities of the Committee on Small Business, the bill includes a significant improvement package for the HUBZone program. This is a program which I was pleased to present and have adopted by Congress, signed by the President, that provides set-aside contracts to bring jobs and economic opportunity to areas where there has been high unemployment and high poverty. This is a geographically based program, which actually takes the jobs to the communities that need them to help people get from welfare to work by using the power of the Federal Government as a purchaser to create business opportunities. 
   First and foremost, the bill, H.R. 5545, addresses the inadvertent exclusion of Indian tribal enterprises and Alaska Native corporations from the program. These provisions resulted from extensive negotiations between  the Committee on Small Business, the Committee on Indian Affairs, and the Alaska congressional delegation. The HUBZone section of the bill also seeks to clarify the effects of the HUBZone price evaluation preference on commodity procurements in which the range of bid prices tends to be small, and the HUBZone price evaluation preference would be overwhelmingly decisive. 
   In addition, the legislation makes other improvements and clarifications in a variety of SBA programs to make them more effective. For example, there has been some confusion among the Federal agencies about contract preferences for service-disabled veterans. This bill would make it absolutely clear that service-disabled veterans are on the same preference level as the small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses for Federal contracting opportunities. 
   The conference report incorporates the new market venture capital program of 2000. The purpose of this program is, similarly, to promote economic development, new investment, and job opportunities in low-income areas. It accomplishes this goal by providing incentives to encourage small venture capital 
   firms to invest in targeted low-income communities and economically distressed inner cities and poor rural counties. 
   This is a program that has been developed with bipartisan support. This is certainly something that will assist us in this country in getting more people off of welfare, making sure that job opportunities go to the places and the people who most need them. 
   When the Congress enacted my HUBZone legislation 3 years ago, it established the Federal contracting incentives to lure small businesses into distressed cities and rural counties. I believe this new market venture capital program will add an additional building block in our strategy to make sure these economically distressed areas are attractive to small businesses and that they will be able to bring job opportunities and new vitality to these historically neglected areas of the Nation. 
   As everybody now has heard from the other side, the conference report does deal with taxes. I believe it is a great victory for the American taxpayers. The tax portion has four sections. First, the legislation includes the Foreign Sales Corporation Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. I can see that is going to be a real winner. That title really rolls off your tongue, the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. That one will be a winner. But it is must-do legislation, seriously. We have to do it by November 1, if we are to avoid a potential trade war--at least sanctions --with the European Union. 
   Second, the conference report includes a House-Senate compromise on the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, which has enormous bipartisan support, having passed the House earlier this year by a vote of 401-25 and being reported out of the Senate Finance Committee by unanimous vote. That legislation includes sweeping changes encouraging retirement savings, expanding pension coverage by increasing contribution limits on IRA and other types of pension plans, increasing portability, and providing meaningful relief for women who often take time off to raise their families. And it contains a number of provisions to reduce regulatory burdens that are very excessive and will be especially helpful to small businesses, our constituency in the Committee on Small Business. 
   The third part of the tax portion of the conference report is a minimum wage increase and a package of small business tax provisions. I raised questions about raising the minimum wage when it first came here. I think it can be detrimental to small business. I do not believe it is good economics. We know it is good politics. It is always nice to promise somebody a raise, particularly when you don't have to come up with the money that they are being paid. This is great election year politics. I know everybody wants to do something. It makes you feel good to give somebody a raise out of someone else's pocket. 
   The problem is, right now it probably won't hurt small businesses too much because most small businesses I know of, if they are hiring reasonably competent workers, have to pay well over the minimum wage. The real downside is that the very people it is supposed to help are the ones who may not get the jobs. Right now we see people who have never had a job before, teenagers, first-time employees, perhaps persons with disabilities, often minority students coming out of college, have trouble getting jobs. If the minimum wage is raised, we may see in the United States, as we do in Europe, high unemployment among teenagers. 
   What the minimum wage does is make it very difficult to get on the first rung of that ladder of economic progress. It is like putting grease on that first rung of the ladder and saying, boy, this is going to make it easy to slip onto that first rung. Unfortunately, the grease on the first rung of the ladder too often slips people off, when businesses find they just can't make a profit, hiring people at an inflated minimum wage. 
   I hope we will continue, as a result of the economic and fiscal restraint of the Republican-led Congress, if we can keep the economy going as it has since the Republicans took control of the Congress beginning in 1995, we hope that wages will continue to go up and productivity will continue to go up so we don't need the minimum wage. If the time comes when there are tight economic times, the victims of the increased minimum wage will be the small businesses, the smallest businesses, the ones with the lowest profit margin and the most needy workers, the workers very often not supporting their families but trying to get on the first rung of the economic ladder so they can build a bank account and make enough money to start a family. 
   In addition to the minimum wage, however, there are small business advantages from this bill. I appreciate the work of Chairman ROTH to include a significant package of small business tax relief items, including something that has been my top priority since we began in 1995, and that is 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed starting in 2001. I have been working on it for over 5 years to ensure that the self-employed are on a level playing field with their corporate competitors. 
   In the past we said, you can have it, but it was 2007 and then 2003. A lot of self-employed people said: That is nice, but I can't wait until 2007 or 2003 to get sick. Well, now I hope we will have it in 2001, so they will be able to afford the health insurance for themselves and their families. Coupled with a new above-the-line deduction for employees who pay for the majority of their health insurance costs, we will now reach more than a million of the uninsured and help them get the coverage they need and deserve. 
   Second is a repeal of the Clinton-Gore installment limitation, which has been an unforeseen barrier to small businesses looking to sell all or part of their business assets, in many cases to fund the small business owner's retirement. 
   Third, a clear safe harbor for small businesses to use the cash method of accounting. This has been a real nightmare for the smallest businesses, to have to come up with accrual accounting. They are in business to make widgets or sell hamburgers, not to be accounting specialists who have to come up with an accrual system. Now small businesses with gross receipts under $2.5 million can continue to use cash accounting. It also lets the IRS know that it can stop its campaign to force small businesses into using the more burdensome accrual accounting rules. 
   We will increase expensing of equipment up to $35,000 per year, which will reduce compliance costs by allowing small firms to deduct purchases rather than setting up elaborate depreciation schedules to figure out how to deduct them over many years. 
   Something we are proud of, particularly in the Ninth Congressional District in Missouri, which is represented by my colleague on the House side, who has been a champion of this measure, and my Senate colleague to the north, Senator GRASSLEY, is the new farmer, fisherman, and ranch risk management accounts --the FFARRM accounts--which permit farmers, fishermen, and ranchers to make tax-deductible contributions of up to 20 percent of the income in good years for use during subsequent economic declines. The bill  also provides important alternative minimum tax--or AMT--relief for farmers who use income averaging, and it extends the work opportunity tax credit through June 30, 2004. 
   The fourth component of the tax package is the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000, which is intended to reinvigorate our distressed communities. This portion of the legislation includes the House-Administration compromise on empowerment zones/renewal communities and new markets tax credit, which creates 40 renewal communities and 9 empowerment zones. 
   This certainly was not my recommended legislation, but this was part of the bipartisan compromise we reached with the President and incorporated it in the bill. These renewal communities would have a zero capital gains rate, and the legislation creates a new-markets tax credit for equity investments in qualified low-income communities. The goal of this program is to bring the innovation and creativity of America's businesses--and especially small businesses--into these renewal communities to make real economic change for the future. 
   The legislation also increases the low-income housing tax credit and private-activity-bonds volume caps, which are key financing features for renewal communities. They included 
   provisions to help clean up brownfields by allowing expensing of brownfield cleanup costs, except Superfund sites, through 2003. That is good for communities and for the environment. 
   These four core components of the tax package provide important tax relief for Americans throughout our economy. 
   The legislation also addresses several other priorities, such as the school construction bond provision which I have already mentioned. This is another avenue to address construction and modernization needs without a Federal stranglehold. It is my belief that local school districts know best how to address their needs. While providing them this assistance, it keeps the Federal camel's nose out from under the tent. 
   The adoption tax credit, which is very important and has been addressed previously on the floor, is to encourage loving families to adopt children. It also makes other strides toward improving and reforming our Tax Code as which we are going to have to rely. The White House leadership, next year, I believe will complete that work. 
   Medicare. This legislative package addresses the problems caused by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as implemented with the chronic incompetence of the Health Care Financing Administration. I have heard time and time again health care providers talk about what is happening to them under the BBA. When you ask the questions, you find out it is how HCFA has implemented the BBA. They have used the BBA to cut far more than Congress ever mandated. 
   What they seem to want to do is to cut out choice for patients--cut out the choice they have of going into a Medicare insurance plan such as we have or an HMO plan as is available to FEHBP members; it puts out their choices to use home health care. 
   HCFA has gone about doing everything in its power to collapse the present system. I guess--and I can only surmise --that they would like to see the kind of health care plan that was so infamously run up the flagpole in 1993 without getting any salutes. 
   I remember hanging around here in August of 1993 as they talked about Mrs. Clinton's health care plan and kept waiting for somebody to try to introduce it and get a vote on it. But as we looked at that June bug longer and longer, as people got to look at it more and more, the minimum amount of enthusiasm I saw initially grew even less. But HCFA has never given up. By killing off parts of our health care system one at a time, they hope maybe we can have a totally Government-run health care system. 
   The Vice President on the campaign trail has said he hopes to be able to go to a European system within a few years. Well, if you let HCFA in control long enough to kill the existing health care system, there may not be anything left. 
   This Medicare bill, just very briefly, provides benefits to patients and providers worth $32 billion, benefits for nearly 40 million Americans relying on Medicare. Glaucoma screening, colonoscopy screening, mammography, nutrition therapy services for some patients, additional coverage of immunosuppressive drugs --all have been added to the Medicare program. Help for just about every type of Medicare provider to allow them to continue to provide high-quality care to seniors and the disabled. Hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, home health care, nursing homes, hospice providers, and Medicare HMOs that 
   have been driven out of the field by cuts, and targeted help for particular health care providers that are most in need. As one who lives in a rural community, the bill targets $1.7 billion for rural health care providers to help them deal with the unique challenges of rural health care, which I think is very important. 
   More than $6 billion to Medicare HMOs will help address the widespread withdrawals from the Medicare program we have seen in the last couple of years. 
   Why have HMOs been leaching Medicare? Not because they are evil incarnate, as some would have us believe. If that were the case, the seniors losing their HMO coverage would not be so upset. No, these providers left because the payment system for HMOs is seriously flawed and in many areas has provided inadequate reimbursement. This new funding will address this issue. 
   Approximately $1.5 billion in assistance to home health care providers. Home health care patients have, by far, borne the greatest brunt of HCFA's maladministration of the BBA. They were supposed to save $16 billion over 5 years, and they are on the path to save $55 billion to $60 billion by eliminating too much of home health care and making it unavailable. It has been devastating. Tens of thousands of seniors previously receiving home health care lost it during the crisis of the last few years. The bill postpones for 1 additional year the potentially devastating 15 percent cuts which are addressed in this legislation. They would be the death knell of home health care. 
   Next year, we need to get rid of that completely. We need to get a brand new Medicare system, such as the bipartisan deal that was worked out in the Breaux-Frist commission before the White House pulled the plug on it. 
   Finally, this bill helps community health centers, the clinics that exist in more than 3,000 urban and rural medically underserved areas nationwide, ensuring that they continue to receive adequate reimbursement from the State Medicaid programs so they can pursue their mission of providing care to those Americans who would otherwise not get any. 
   There is a long list of more than 40 organizations, led by the American Hospital Association, supporting this legislation.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, overall I believe this is an excellent package that is badly needed by seniors, the disabled, hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. 
   Finally, we have already had a lot of discussion about the Pain Relief Promotion Act. Obviously it is controversial. The bill simply amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the use of federally regulated drugs to help his or her life. 
   Let me be clear about that. Simply put, this would prevent any effort to assist in a suicide by using controlled substances such as powerful pain killers. The bill goes further in its efforts to provide appropriate relief to people suffering great pain. It provides a variety of provisions and educational programs to encourage appropriate pain relief. Indeed, under this legislation for the first time ever the Controlled Substances Act would explicitly recognize that aggressive pain relief is an appropriate and fully warranted use of controlled substances. 
   I believe a vast majority of Americans share a simple belief--that I hold very strongly--that doctors we rely on to nurture and extend our lives should not be party to efforts actively to promote someone's death. The bill simply recognizes that consensus.  
   It looks like we are going to have lots of discussion and have an opportunity to hear many different views on this legislation. But before we paint it as the most ugly duckling coming down the path, I thought my colleagues and those who may be watching or listening still at this late hour would like to know that there are some beautiful limbs and beautiful facets of this that are very important bipartisan measures. 
   I hope we can pass this because there are many priorities that the President has asked for, that leaders on the Democratic side have asked for, and I believe our side wishes as well that are beneficial to a great number of American people who are waiting for our response. 
   I thank the Chair. I apologize to my colleague from Nevada whom I misled into thinking that it was going to be a short set of remarks.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now begin consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4635, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, notwithstanding the receipt of the papers, and it be considered as having been read and the conference report be considered under the following agreement: 30 minutes under the control of Senator GRAHAM of Florida, 10 minutes equally divided between Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, 20 minutes equally divided between Senators DOMENICI and REID, and 10 minutes equally divided between Senators STEVENS and BYRD. I further ask consent that at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report without any intervening action, motion, or debate.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the information of all Members, let me point out that at the request of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, we are moving forward and hope to have a vote, certainly no later than 3:30 this afternoon, because we do need to get this measure passed, as well as several others. 
   I will take just a few minutes of my time now. I am pleased to present to the Senate the conference report to H.R. 4635, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. As I indicated previously, this has been a very unusual year. The conference report represents the compromise agreement reached with Senator MIKULSKI, Congressman WALSH, Congressman MOLLOHAN, and myself, in consultation with the administration. 
   Certainly it is not a perfect situation. It is not the way I would like to do the bill. I would prefer to proceed  with passage of the VA-HUD appropriations bill in a more customary manner. Nevertheless, with the assistance of the leaders of the committee, and the leadership, we have brought the bill to the floor. I think it is a good and balanced compromise that I believe addresses the concerns of our colleagues, both in the House and the Senate, while striking the right balance in funding programs under the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee. 
   The conference report totals approximately $105.8 billion, including $24.6 billion in mandatory veterans benefits, some $1 billion over the Senate committee-reported bill and almost $1 billion less than the President's budget request. Outlays are funded at roughly $110.8 billion for the current fiscal year, $540 million over the Senate committee-reported bill. 
   We did our best to satisfy priorities of Senators who made special requests for high-priority items, such as economic development grants, water infrastructure improvements, and the like. Such requests numbered several thousand, demonstrating the high level of interest and demand for assistance provided in this bill. 
   We also attempted to address the administration's top concerns, including funding for 79,000 new housing vouchers, as well as record funding for EPA at roughly $7.8 billion. 
   I am not going to summarize the bill today. We have done that before when the Senate passed the identical bill on October 12. The conference between the House and Senate has now confirmed that legislation. 
   I think everyone has had an opportunity to review the bill. 
   I offer my sincerest thanks to my ranking member, Senator MIKULSKI, and her staff for their cooperation and support throughout the process. Particularly, I thank Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Alexa Mitrakos from Senator MIKULSKI's staff. I obviously could not have done it without the good leadership and hard work of my team: John Kamarch, Carrie Apostolou, Cheh Kim, and Joe Norrell. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to all those allocated time.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on another very important appropriations bill that has been addressed on this floor and is being considered. That is the debate on education in the Labor-HHS bill. We want to see that important bill moved forward, get passed and signed by the President. 
   It is clear that the two sides of the aisle have very differing views on how we ought to go about improving education. Let us all agree that improving education should be our national priority. We on this side happen to think it is a local and State responsibility, but it is a national priority, the top national priority. 
   Now, one side of the aisle trusts the Federal Government to make the decisions. The other side of the aisle, our side, trusts the parents and teachers, the school districts, the school board members, to make those decisions. This side of the aisle seems to base its decision on whether we are successful in education on the total dollars spent. Our side would judge success on academic achievement of students. This side of the aisle believes accountability comes in successfully filling out paperwork, jumping through the hoops that Washington lays out for school boards and teachers. Our side believes accountability is based on academic achievement. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle believe that the Olympians on the Hill--Capitol Hill, that is--know what is best for the folks down in the valley. Our side believes that the great ideas, accomplishments, and actions occur on the local level and that the Olympians on the Hill should watch and learn. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Vice President talk a good game. Let me give you my view on what is going on. First, they have talked about the 100,000 teachers program, the school construction program. They have proposed to set aside billions of dollars for these programs alone and not allow flexibility that we strongly believe should be rested in the hands of the local schools, the parents who are served by them, and their children, and the people who run them. 
   I support reduced class size. I campaigned for Governor on that basis. I know there are many school districts around the country that need new school buildings. However, as one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, I want to do the right thing. I agree with that. I know our children and parents and schools are counting on us, in my view, to get out of the way and let them do the job they are not only hired to do but they are dedicated to do. 
   We saw in the first debate what happens when Washington tries to make decisions for what is best in local schools. Vice President GORE told a terrible tale about this young girl who had to stand up in class. After the debate, we found out that she had to stand up or she had to have a chair brought in for 1 day because they had $100,000 worth of new computers. The school superintendent said that getting a place for her to sit was not really the problem. I understand he mentioned something about school lunches in another school district, and very quickly some of the folks from that school district said that is not the problem at all. That is not to say--and I am not saying here--that the Vice President didn't hear real concerns, that he made them up. 
   I am just saying: How are we here in Washington, how is the Federal bureaucracy, how is the Department of Education, and how are those of us who are sitting here in this room trying to make decisions for local schools all across the country supposed to know what the problems are in the Sarasota School or the Callaway County R-6 school in Missouri or a school district in California or a school district in Washington or a school district in Maine? 
   There is a lot of talk about 100,000 new teachers. That proposal sounds good. It is a great slogan to use when you are trying to gain national headlines. But when you look at the formula, trying to find out whether it works, it doesn't work. 
   I traveled around to school districts and talked to school boards and teachers and administrators. Let me tell you how that formula works in Missouri. The Gilliam C-4 School District would get $384; the Holliday C-2 School District would get $608; the Pleasant View R-VI School District would get $846. 
   I first heard about this problem from a small school district when someone in that room said: We would get enough money for 11 percent of a teacher. One other person in the room said: We would get enough money for 17 percent of a teacher. They haven't quite figured out how to use 11 percent of a teacher or 17 percent of a teacher or how to spend $846 on a teacher. 
   Over 175 school districts in the State of Missouri would receive less than $10,000 under this program. Surely you don't think they are going to be able to hire a teacher to reach that 100,000 new teacher goal for less than $10,000. 
   Many of the schools have already addressed classroom size at the expense of other things. 
   Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose giving them the flexibility to utilize these resources in another manner which may suit their needs but which doesn't fall into the dictates of the one-size-fits-all solution that Washington is being pushed to propose by the administration and by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   They are saying that we are not providing the school the resources to do what they need to do because Washington is trying to tell them what their priorities should be without knowing why that girl had to stand up or sit on a stool brought in for that one classroom. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Vice President GORE advocate taking billions of dollars off the  table for thousands of schools across the country. To me, the issue is simple. We must give our States and localities the flexibility to use the resources to improve our public education system and to make decisions at the local level.

   Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. I have addressed similar questions, but to remove any confusion, I clarify the statement of managers now before the Senate. In directing that the NAS report by properly considered by the Agency, the language in the statement of managers directs the Agency to consider the findings of the report when making site-specific remedial decisions and in developing remediation guidance for contaminated aquatic sediments. In both cases, EPA should consider the findings of the report so that the best science available will be taken into account before going forward. In implementing this direction, EPA should seek to ensure that Congress can evaluate how the findings of the report have been considered.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues the sadness that all of us in Missouri feel this week. This has been a very, very sad week for us. 
   Late Monday evening, we lost our Governor, Mel Carnahan, along with his son, Randy, and a top aide, Chris Sifford, who were killed tragically in a plane crash. 
   Nearly having completed two terms as Governor, Mel Carnahan was in a heated race for the Senate with our colleague, JOHN ASHCROFT. Mel Carnahan was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather as well as a public servant who had devoted much of his career and much of his adult life to serving the people of our State. 
   The news of Governor Carnahan's very untimely and tragic death serves as a reminder to all of us of the preciousness of life and its unpredictability. 
   Our thoughts, our prayers, and our sympathy go out to his wife Jean, to his daughter Robin, to his sons, Russ and Tom, and his grandchildren during this difficult time. We also extend our deepest sympathies to all the people who worked closely with him and considered him their close friend. None of us can pretend to understand the pain they must feel at this time. 
   But I hope they will find comfort in knowing that their husband, father, grandfather, and friend will have a lasting impact on many lives. The fruits of Mel Carnahan's efforts will be felt in our State for many years to come. He presided over a period of economic growth in our State. He worked hard to reform Missouri's welfare system, crime laws, and educational system.  
   Mel Carnahan and I were friends for a long time--probably 
   30 years. It is no secret that we were often political opponents. We disagreed on a lot of things, and he was a tough opponent; no question about that. 
   A couple of years ago when I was getting ready to run for reelection, there was some thought that we might have to run against each other. But at that time, he chose to stay in Jefferson City and serve the people of Missouri for the remainder of his term as Governor. When asked why he entered public service, Governor Carnahan said he was inspired by the words of Adlai Stevenson, who said public service was a ``high calling,'' and he urged young people to get involved. 
   Mel Carnahan lived his belief that public service was a ``high calling.'' He brought the best of himself to the job. He loved Missouri and Missourians. He loved rural Missouri and his adopted hometown of Rolla, MO. He always wanted the best for our State. While the two of us may only have agreed on a handful of issues in 30 years, when it came time to defend the interests of Missouri, we fought arm in arm together. Some of you may recall a few battles we had on behalf of Missouri and the neighbors of the Missouri River in a battle against the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   But in the end, a man's position on the issues of the day is only a small measure of his life. 
   In this age of multimillion-dollar campaign advertising budgets and media consultants, Gov. Mel Carnahan still believed in keeping in touch with individual Missourians. He died while attempting to get to a campaign event in a small town in Missouri that maybe few outside our State ever heard of. As Governor, he crisscrossed our State endlessly, visiting schools and farms, veterans, and highway dedications. He worked hard and Missourians loved him for it. Twice they elected him by large margins to the highest office in our State. 
   I particularly admired and appreciated the friendship we had as political opponents, as people committed to public service in our State. 
   I was with him on Saturday at the homecoming for the University of Missouri. We shared a common interest on that day; our football team didn't do well. But Mel Carnahan, with a ready smile and a lovely wife, was there. We enjoyed our time together as we appreciated and looked back on the tremendous accomplishments he had and the contributions he made to the State of Missouri. 
   At a commencement speech in his town of Rolla last year, Governor Carnahan told graduates, ``Each of you was put on this Earth for a reason ..... life is precious and fragile ..... and each of us has such a short time to make our mark on the world that we must not waste it.'' 
   Surely Mel Carnahan wasted no time. He made the most of every minute, and our lives are richer for it, and for his friendship. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends in Missouri.

   Mr. BOND. On behalf of the leader, permit me to explain that today the Senate will begin debate on the HUD-VA appropriations bill. Senators BYRD and BOXER have amendments in order. Those amendments will be offered and debated prior to 12:30 p.m. today. At 12:30, there will be up to four stacked rollcall votes on amendments to the VA-HUD bill, final passage of the bill, and final passage of the conference report to accompany the legislative branch/Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. Following the votes, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense authorization bill. There are approximately 6 hours of debate requested on the conference report. Therefore, Senators should expect votes into the evening regarding the DOD authorization conference report. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as comanager, I am pleased to present to the Senate, H.R. 4635, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, as reported from the Committee on Appropriations. 
   This is an unusual year. We have offered, and it has been accepted, a managers' amendment that I have offered with my distinguished colleague, Senator MIKULSKI, which will replace the Senate committee-reported text of H.R. 4635. 
   This compromise amendment was worked out in agreement with Senator MIKULSKI, Congressman WALSH, Congressman MOLLOHAN, and me in consultation with the administration. This is an unusual and far from perfect situation. It is not the way I would normally prefer to proceed with the passage of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. Nevertheless, we have worked hard to develop a comprehensive package that considers the concerns of all colleagues in both the House and Senate. It also met the test for approval by the administration. 
   I strongly believe that the proposed compromise language strikes the right balance in funding the programs under the jurisdiction of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   The managers amendment/compromise agreement totals some $105.8 billion, including some $24.6 billion in mandatory veterans benefits. This represents some $1.1 billion over the Senate committee-reported bill and almost $1 billion less than the budget request. Outlays are funded at some $110.7 billion for fiscal year 2001, $540 million over the Senate committee-reported bill of $110.2 billion. The bill meets our current funding allocation, per the Budget Committee. 
   We also did our best to satisfy priorities of Senators who made special requests for such items as economic development grants, water infrastructure improvements and the like. Such requests numbered several thousand, illustrating the level of interest and demand for assistance provided in this bill. 
   We also attempted to address the administration's top concerns, including funding for 79,000 new housing vouchers, as well as record funding for EPA at $7.8 billion. 
   Before going into the details of the compromise agreement, I would like to commend my ranking members, Senator MIKULSKI, and her staff for their cooperation and support throughout this process. We would not have reached agreement as quickly, nor attained as good a result, without her active help. She is a vitally important part of this operation. I am deeply grateful for her help, guidance, and counsel. 
   To turn to the elements of the bill: For Veterans Affairs, the proposed compromise language to VA/HUD FY 2001 appropriations bill includes funding for VA that totals $47 billion, including $22.4 billion in discretionary spending. Veterans needs remain the highest priority for this bill, and compared to the President's request, this bill has an additional $54.7 million. 
   The compromise includes $20.28 billion for VA medical care, $1.4 billion more than the current level, and $351 million for research, an increase of $30 million above the budget request level for this key program which helps ensure the best quality of care to our veterans and keeps the best doctors in the VA system. 
   The VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise also includes about $180 million more than the President's request for VA medical care by including a provision that will ensure VA will not be penalized from collecting less in new receipts authorized under the 1999 Millennium Act. 
   In addition, the compromise includes a new Title V, Filipino Veterans Benefits Improvements, which provides benefits to Filipino veterans who fought alongside American soldiers in World War II and who live in the United States, equal to those benefits provided to U.S. veterans of World War II. This is a long overdue remedy of inequitable treatment of Filipino veterans. We thank our colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their agreement and assistance in including this provision. 
   For HUD, the VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise appropriates some $30.6 billion, approximately the same as the budget request. This includes a section 8 rescission of some $1.8 billion in excess section 8 funds. This funding includes all the funding needed to renew all expiring section 8 contracts and also provides funds for 79,000 incremental vouchers, an administration priority. 
   The public housing capital funding is increased by $45 million above the budget request in fiscal year 2001 to $3 billion. Similarly, the public housing operating funding has been increased by $50 million above the budget request in fiscal year 2001 to $3.242 billion. 
   In addition, CDBG and HOME funds have been increased by 
   $150 million each in fiscal year 2001 with CDBG at $5.057 billion and HOME at $1.8 billion, respectively. These are important block grant programs which rely on decisionmaking guided by local choice and need. I also hope these funds are used as an investment in housing production to meet the increasing affordable housing needs of low-income families. Staff work in this subcommittee has shown one of the serious problems facing us is lack of affordable housing. 
   In addition, the VA/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 funds section 202 elderly housing at $779 million, the budget request, and section 811 housing for disabled persons at $217 million, $7 million over the budget request. A separate account has been created at $100 million for the renewal of expiring shelter plus care contracts. 
   This bill includes a number of noncontroversial HUD administrative provisions, whereas we have dropped, at the request of the Senate Banking Committee, a new housing production program for extremely low-income families and a provision that would have provided favorable treatment under FHA for municipal workers such as teachers, firemen, and police. 
   We also have maintained a provision that would increase the amount of section 8 assistance available to PHAs for project-based assistance from 15 percent to 20 percent with a limitation that no more than 25 percent of the units in a building can be project-based, except in the case of seniors, disabled persons and scattered site housing as well as a provision that would require HUD to maintain section 8 projected-based assistance on a HUD-held or HUD-owned multifamily housing projects where the project is elderly or disabled housing unless that housing is not viable. These are important provisions that focus on local decisionmaking and local housing needs. 
   For EPA, the VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise includes a record $7.8 billion for EPA, plus an additional $138 million for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences which traditionally have been funded under EPA's appropriation and are funded separately in this bill. Thus, compared to the budget request, the compromise will provide an additional $686 million more than the President and about $400 million more than fiscal year 2000. 
   Additional funds of $550 million above the budget request have been provided for clean water state revolving funds as well as additional funds of $12 million for section 106 water quality grants--$57 million above the fiscal year 2000 level to help states meet future total maximum daily load requirements. 
   Compared to last year, the compromise increases operating programs by $246 million including an additional $20 million for the climate change technology initiative voluntary programs and protection of all core programs. 
   The compromise does not fund new, unauthorized programs such as clean air partnerships or Great Lakes grants which would detract from EPA core responsibilities. 
   With respect to legislative issues, the compromise bill includes the fiscal year 1999 bill with report language relative to the Kyoto Protocol. The proposed report would provide up to an additional 6 months for finalizing the arsenic-in-drinking water rule, and the bill modifies the so-called Collins-Linder provision on ozone nonattainment  designations which would allow EPA to make designations once the Supreme Court decides this case but not later than June 2001. 
   These so-called EPA riders are primarily report language which we believe are fair and reasonable compromises on issues where there are broad questions and we need to bring some resolution. While everyone may not agree with these decisions, we have worked hard to balance the decisions associated with this account to the overall benefit of EPA policy and funding needs in consultation with and agreement with the administration. 
   For FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for 2001 appropriates a total of $936.8 million for FEMA and includes an additional $1.3 billion in disaster relief contingency funds. With the disaster relief funds provided here, coupled with contingency funds already on hand, funding will be sufficient to meet fiscal year 2001 disaster relief operations. 
   Most notable in FEMA funding is the addition of $30 million above the Senate- or House-appropriated levels for emergency food and shelter, for a total of $140 million. This popular program results in temporary housing and food assistance to thousands of needy individuals with very little overhead costs. 
   For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the VA-HUD appropriations compromise funds NASA at $14.285 billion instead of $14.035 billion, for an increase of $250 million. This account includes $5.46 billion for human space flight, which is $37 million below the administration request for fiscal year 2001. This reduction reflects a NASA request for a reduction in this account in order to provide full funding for the Mars 2003 lander program. 
   The funding includes $6.19 billion in fiscal year 2001 for science, aeronautics, and technology, instead of $5.93 billion as requested by the administration, an increase of $261 million above the budget request. Included in this is $20 million for Living with a Star and $290 million for the space launch initiative, including $40 million for alternative access to the space station initiative. In addition, mission support is funded for fiscal year 2001 at $2.6 billion, instead of $2.58 billion, an increase of $24.7 million over the budget request. 
   For the National Science Foundation--and this is a very important area for the ranking member and me--the VA-HUD compromise funds NSF at $4.43 billion, a $529 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 enacted level and $146 million below the President's request. Funding highlights include $215 million for information technology research, $150 million for nanotechnology, and $65 million for plant genome research. Lastly, to assist smaller research institutions, $75 million was included for EPSCoR, a $20 million increase over last year's level, and $10 million for the Office of Innovation Partnerships. 
   We believe very strongly the scientific exploration in space needs to be spread broadly throughout the land to ensure we achieve inclusion of knowledgeable and dedicated scientists at institutions which may not traditionally have received funding in the past. 
   I consider NSF a priority account that needs additional funding in order to pace U.S. leadership in science and technology. Senator MIKULSKI and I have heard from leading scientists in this country who say that we are falling behind because we are not providing enough funding for the National Science Foundation. Medical doctors who depend directly upon the research work done at the National Institutes of Health have come to us and said that we must bring NSF funding up to NIH funding because so many of the health breakthroughs on which NIH is working depend upon the support the National Science Foundation provides. 
   Senator MIKULSKI and I have launched an effort to double the NSF budget. We have circulated a letter and have a significant number of colleagues who have joined with us. We will be back. We will be asking the full Senate to recognize a priority in the National Science Foundation and help get us on that path for the next year. 
   Finally, for the National Service Corporation, the VA-HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise appropriates $458 million, a $25 million increase over last year's level and $75 million below the budget request. Further, $30 million will be rescinded from excess funds in the National Service Trust. 
   The compromise also funds the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund at $118 million, a $23 million increase over last year's level and $7 million below the request. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Very briefly, this bill includes the provision that provides up to an additional 6 months for EPA to finalize the arsenic in drinking water rule. They can finalize it before June 2001 but will not be held to the statutory deadline. And EPA does not anticipate finalizing the rule until April or May, despite the  act's requirements. The practical effect of knocking this out would be to force EPA to spend its resources fighting in court to do what it cannot otherwise do, and that is take the time necessary to do the job right. 
   The Safe Drinking Water Act called for a full year of comment. The full year would be up June 2001. The most conservative estimates of compliance, including EPA's, for the smallest communities show water rates increasing by hundreds of dollars per family. 
   The State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality says the rate increase to remove arsenic from the Heartland Mobile Home Park would be $230 per month per customer. Even the EPA said it would be $70 per month per customer. 
   Do you know what is going to happen? No system. They are going to be off the system. There will be no water. They will get it from sources that are not protected at all. 
   This is a very important rule that needs to be worked out scientifically. EPA has not identified the specific level in drinking water below which there is not a significant risk to public health. 
   On the ozone nonattainment designation, it seems to me completely unreasonable that EPA should be making designations when that standard is before the U.S. Supreme Court. Why do the EPA and the State expend resources giving communities a black eye by designating them nonattainment areas when the entire ability to designate may be repealed by the Supreme Court? The EPA would be allowed, under this legislation, to move forward when the Supreme Court acts but no later than June 2001. 
   Do not blacklist communities before there is a statutory authorization. The National Association of Counties has said this process will brand hundreds of new counties across the country clean air violators resulting in lost jobs and lost economic opportunity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am sorry we have to get into this little battle over who said what and who said what, when where, and why. Let it be clear that we on both sides made our best efforts to assure that everyone was advised. Twice, Mr. Tom Sliter, a staffer on EPW, was notified and discussed this with my assistant, Ms. Apostolou. He also, I understand, participated in a briefing conducted by Mr. Carliner of the minority staff. 
   Not everybody agreed with all of those things, and we never said that we had 100-percent agreement. We don't get 100-percent agreement, but we do extend the courtesy to all of the Members who are interested to let them know what we are doing and give them an opportunity. I am sorry to get into this, but when it was said that we did this without notification in an attempt to hide this, that is absolutely wrong. That is an unfortunate and unfair slam at our staff. I do not intend to let it stand. 
   The next point I will make, just to call it to the attention of my colleague from California, is we have been advised that no California sites would be affected. EPA has indicated they will be sending a letter to assure the Senator that no California sites would be affected by the proposed managers' amendment, or the language in the statement of managers. 
   Let me say that while, technically, this issue is not before us at this time, we do intend to include a statement which has been carefully worked out at painstaking meetings that Senator MIKULSKI and I had, along with our House counterparts, 
   with OMB Director Jack Lew and George Frampton, CEQ Director. This language will be included to address the concerns raised by EPA about House report language on this issue. 
   The report language simply requires EPA to take into consideration a National Academy of Sciences study on contaminated sediments, which has been worked on for the past several years and is expected within the next 3 months, before dredging or invasive remediation actions at sites where a plan has not been adopted by October 1, 2000, or where dredging has not already occurred. 
   Exceptions are provided for voluntary agreements and urgent cases where there is significant threat to public health. Furthermore, EPA is not prohibited from proposing draft remediation plans involving dredging or invasive remediation technologies. 
   In view of the time, effort, and resources that have gone into examining the efficacy of dredging contaminated sediments, it would truly be a shame not to consider the best science available before going forward. This is not going to result in undue delays, but it will result in an informed process. 
   Dredging is very controversial and it is very costly. What do you do with the dredge material if you dig up material that is contaminated? Where do you put it? I can tell you that the answer will be NIMBY--not in my backyard. That is the first thing everybody will say. ``Can't you find a better or safer place to put it?" 
   Also, does dredging cause more harm, potentially, to the health and environment than leaving the contaminated sediments in place? When you stir it up and dig into the contaminated sediments, do you spread more out and do you get more in the water supply or in the air? These are things that scientists ought to tell us. The National Academy of Sciences is working on it. What would you do with thousands of truckloads of dredge material if you dredged it up and the National Academy of Sciences says you should have left it in place? 
   Well, it is important that we act on science around this place. I know there are some groups that love to write letters and have their own agenda and say that we need to move forward. I believe most people in this body would agree that getting a peer-reviewed study by the National Academy of Sciences before we engage upon a massive and potential danger-causing activity--dredging up sediments, or other invasive remedies--makes sense. For that reason, I believe that carefully crafted language, which was agreed on by the OMB Director and the CEQ Director, is a far preferable resolution of this very serious question. Let's take the radical step of waiting to rely on the science. 
   I yield to my distinguished colleague from Maryland such time as she may require.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to follow up with some comments on the issues we have discussed today and express, again, my sincere appreciation to my colleague from Maryland for the tremendous cooperation and guidance and valuable assistance she has provided, and her staff, Paul Carliner and others. We have had a lot of difficulties in working out this bill under unusual circumstances, but we both extend our thanks to the chairman and the ranking member, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, for assisting us and for providing us with the resources we needed ultimately to put together a bill that meets the needs in so many important areas, from veterans to housing to the environment to space to science and emergency management. 
   It has been a challenging time. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts noted that we had made an effort with respect to the production of housing. Frankly, I believe there is nothing more important. I think we have finally gotten the attention of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had heretofore focused solely on sending out new vouchers. 
   They wanted new vouchers overall. And my staff did what I thought was a very helpful report--completed it a month or so ago--which pointed out in so many areas vouchers simply cannot be used. There is no place to use them. The nationwide average is about 19 percent. I think in Jersey City some 65 percent of the vouchers cannot be used. In St. Louis County, MO, 50 percent cannot be used. It is an empty promise, a hollow promise, when we give a needy family a certificate that says this will pay their rent, and they take it out someplace and find out they cannot rent anyplace with that voucher, with that section 8 certificate. That does not do much good. 
   So we did fight hard for the production program. People have objected. I think they had legitimate concerns about the provisions. We agreed that these should be considered in an authorizing vehicle. We hope and we urge the Banking Committee next year to take up the problem of housing production. Let's get all these ideas out on the table. 
   My office has a lot of good ideas; I am sure others do. Let's get them all out and work them out in authorizing language. How sweet it would be if we had an authorized piece of housing legislation that would make it unnecessary for us to include housing provisions in the appropriations bill. It might be a lot duller, but I believe the ranking member and I could still pass the appropriations bill. So I urge them to deal with those housing questions. 
   We also thank our colleagues from the Environment and Public Works Committee for their helpful comments. As a member of that committee, I urge them to take a look at these many provisions which are included in our bill because of concerns over the direction we are moving in the environment. I would like to deal with them on the authorizing basis. I hope that we may do so in the future. 
   Mr. President, I thank all our colleagues for their help. 
   I reserve 2 minutes for the chairman of the committee at such time as he may choose for matters that he wishes to bring up.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, with respect to the arsenic rider, the National Academy of Sciences says somebody must act, but the EPA has not determined what action must be taken. Give them the full year that the Clean Water Act envisioned. We are doing this so they can conduct the process and not wind up spending their time in court. 
   With respect to the ozone nonattainment designations, this is simply saying: Don't go out and put black eyes on communities when lower courts have said that the EPA doesn't have the authority to issue those designations. Wait until you find out whether they actually have the authority to go out and brand a community as being out of attainment with this particular standard until you find out whether it is lawful. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing this amendment.

The cause of peace and international security is one that is worth a major effort, and it is not without sacrifices, as we saw today.

We do not intend as a democracy committed to freedom and human rights to be deterred from our continuing efforts by these acts of terrorism. These do nothing but bring sorrow and heartache to the families and loved ones left behind, and they strengthen the will of the rest of us to say that we will not bow to the terrorists acts. They will not deter us. They only strengthen us not only in our prayers for those who have given the ultimate sacrifice but in our commitment to ensure it does not deter our activities.

On Monday, September 25, 2000, the House of Representatives amended the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2392, the Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000, by adding the following bills to this legislation: H.R. 2614 (The Certified Development Company Program Improvement Act of 2000), H.R. 2615, (to make improvements to the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program), H.R. 3843, (the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000), and H.R. 3845, (the Small Business Investment Corrections Act of 2000). 
   While the House-passed bill includes many important programs to help small businesses, there are some serious omissions. Although I strongly support H.R. 2392 as amended by the House, Senator JOHN KERRY and I are offering an amendment in the nature of a substitute to restore some of the most serious omissions to H.R. 2392. Our amendment adds to, but does not remove, any provisions from the House-passed bill. 
   The House-passed version of H.R. 2392 failed to include some very key provisions that are critical to the mission of SBA in Fiscal Year 2001. The House bill did include the Senate-passed bill to improve and extend the SBIR program for eight years, and it did adopt authorization levels for SBA programs included in the Senate version of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000. However, the House bill failed to include many key provisions that were approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business earlier this year. Our Substitute Amendment will restore some of the most important omitted provisions. 
   The following is a list of the program amendments that were excluded from the House bill that we have included in the Bond-Kerry substitute amendment: Senator KERRY's Microloan program amendments that make extensive improvements in this key small business credit program; re-authorization of the National Women's Business Council, an amendment sponsored by Senator LANDRIEU during the committee markup; a change in the small business size standard system proposed by Senator FEINSTEIN that will help small fresh fruit and vegetable packing houses to qualify for Federal disaster relief; comprehensive amendments that I sponsored to improve the HUBZone program, which is designed to create jobs and investments in economically distressed inner cities and rural counties; the Native American Small Business Development Center Network; and 7(a) guarantee business loan guarantee fee simplification plan. 
   The Senate Committee on Small Business has approved the provisions being added to this legislation. In the case of the SBIR Reauthorization Act, the full Senate has also passed separate legislation. Most of the provisions included in the Bond-Kerry substitute amendment to H.R. 2392 are discussed at length in the following committee reports that have been filed in the Senate: Senate Report 106-289, Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000; and Senate Report 106-422, Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000. 
   There are two major provisions that were included in S. 3121, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, which was reported favorably from the Senate Committee on Small Business, but which have not been included in the Bond-Kerry substitute amendment. I have withdrawn the two provisions in order to expedite congressional passage and the enactment of this important SBA and SBIR re-authorization legislation. It is my intention to make passage of these provisions a high priority in the next Congress. 
   Earlier this year, the Committee on Small Business approved an important provision that would reverse a serious problem caused by the SBA in its implementation of the HUBZone Program, which the Congress enacted in 1997 as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act. As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, the HUBZone Program directs a portion of the Federal contracting dollars into economically distressed areas of the country that have been out of the economic mainstream for far too long. 
   HUBZone areas, which include qualified census tracts, rural counties, and Indian reservations, often are relatively out-of-the-way places that the stream of commerce often by-passe. They tend to be low-traffic areas that do not have a reliable customer base to support business development. As a result, business has been reluctant to move into these areas. It simply has not been profitable absent a customer base to keep them operating. 
   The HUBZone Act seeks to overcome this problem by making it possible for the Federal government to become a customer for small businesses that locate in HUBZones. While a small 
   business works to establish its regular customer base, a Federal contract can help it stabilize its revenues and its profitability. This program provides small business a chance to gain an economic foothold and to provide jobs to these areas. New businesses, more investments and new job opportunities mean new life and new hope for these communities. 
   When Congress enacted the HUBZone program in 1997, a lot of people were concerned about how the HUBZone program would interact with the 8(a) minority enterprise program. We in Congress agreed at that time to protect the 8(a) program by saying the two programs would have parity--neither one would have an automatic preference over the other in getting Federal government contracts. 
   Notwithstanding the 1997 Act, SBA has decided to disregard the instructions of the Congress and put 8(a) ahead of HUBZones in every case. Even if the Government is failing to reach its HUBZone goal and is meeting its Small Disadvantaged Business goal (of which 8(a) is a part), SBA insists that the 8(a) program still has a priority over the HUBZone Program. 
   SBA has abandoned the protection Congress included in the 1997 law when  it enacted the HUBZone Program. Contrary to the law, SBA is setting up the two programs in competition with each other, which is precisely what Congress sought to prevent. Putting either program in competition with the other is a prescription for one of the programs to fail. 
   SBA's position does real harm to minority communities as well. The 8(a) program has a role to play in ensuring minority communities own assets in the economy. It ensures minority business owners get the opportunity to be self-supporting, independent citizens with a full stake in our economy. It's important that all Americans have a piece of the economic pie. 
   HUBZones and 8(a) are two prongs of the same fork. They both have a vital role to play in ensuring opportunity. That's why it's important to correct SBA's current position and to keep the two programs from competing with each other. The remedial language that I have withdrawn from the Substitute Amendment would have reversed the SBA position and restore the equal footing Congress established when it created the HUBZone program three years ago. I intend to pursue a comprehensive remedy to this problem early next year. 
   On November 5, 1999, the Senate approved unanimously S. 1346, a bill I introduced to make the SBA Office of Advocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses throughout the United States. This bill was referred to the House Committee on Small Business on November 8, 1999, and it has failed since then to take action on this important legislation that has the strong support of almost every segment of the small business community. 
   Consequently, when the Senate Small Business Committee marked up the S. 3121, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, it incorporated the entire text of S. 1346 as a separate title. It was the committee's intention that this action might spur the House committee to take action on this bill. Unfortunately, the Houses remains adamant in its opposition. Both Chairman JIM TALENT and Ranking Democrat, NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ from the House Small Business Committee have insisted that the title to strengthen SBA's Office of Advocacy be stricken from the bill. Therefore, I am withdrawing S. 1346 in order to clear the way for swift passage by the Senate and House of Representatives of H.R. 2392 with the Bond/Kerry substitute amendment. 
   Senator KERRY and I have taken some very dramatic steps to insure that the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 is enacted as soon as possible. It is critical that the Senate act quickly to adopt the substitute amendment to H.R. 2392. Our substitute amendment will have a positive impact on nearly every SBA program, from guaranteed business loans, to equity investments, to management and technical assistance for small businesses and budding entrepreneurs. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the critical role played by small businesses in our vibrant economy. We need to enact this comprehensive legislation now so that small businesses and their employees can receive the full benefit of these programs. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of this much needed bill.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue of great importance to America's families--the health of our nation's children--and to talk about crucial legislation which the Senate has passed today called the Children's Health Act of 2000. 
   Whenever we talk about children's health, we should not ignore the fact that there is a lot of good news. The fact is that most children are persistently healthy. A majority of children can actually go through a year with no more serious health problems than scrapes and bruises, a stuffy nose, or an easily-treatable earache. I'm not sure how many of us can say that--I know I can't. And on a variety of indicators that measure children's health, the good news is only getting better. In the last decade, we have seen improvements in immunization rates, infant mortality, child mortality, and reduced teen birth rates. 
   There are of course exceptions to these healthy kids. Thousands of children are born every year with a birth defect. Too many children suffer moderate to serious accidents of all types. And an unfortunate minority face other serious or long-term health problems. Worse, children who are sick are often very sick. These exceptions to the rule are all the more tragic because our expectation is that our children will be healthy. 
   That is why the Children's Health Act, which the Senate has passed today, is so important. As sound as our children's overall health is, it can be better. As well as our nation is doing to protect our children's health, we can do more. 
   Mr. President, the Children's Health Act covers many specific health problems that afflict children--autism, arthritis, asthma, brain injuries, lead poisoning, and so on. Each of the legislative provisions that addresses these problems deserves attention, and I hope that the merits of each of these sections can be presented. Right now, I would like to focus on the sections of the Children's Health Act that I have strongly supported. Most of these provisions were included in legislation--called Healthy Kids 2000--which I introduced last year. 
   As both a Governor and a Senator, one of my main priorities in health care has been to try to find new ways to prevent birth defects. Because we expect our children and our babies to be healthy, birth defects can be truly devastating to a family. Yet they happen far too frequently--150,000 children are born every year with some type of birth defect. 
   Today alone, about 6 or 7 families in this country will have a child with one very serious type of birth defect, called a neural tube defect. Spina bifida is the most well known of these defects of the brain and spine. The complications that result from this type of birth defect range from serious, long-term health problems to death, but the real tragedy is that many of these birth defects could have been prevented. 
   One simple step--women of childbearing age taking 400 micrograms of folic acid every day--can help women and families significantly reduce the chance of this type of birth defect by up to 70 percent. Yet most women just don't know about folic acid. Simply making them aware of the importance of folic acid is such an easy and inexpensive way to prevent birth defects, it is simply silly not to do everything we can to make sure every woman in this country knows about the benefits of folic acid. 
   One provision of the Children's Health Act was taken from the Folic Acid Promotion Act, which I have introduced with Senator ABRAHAM. This section authorizes expanded effort by the Centers for Disease Control to get more women of childbearing age to use folic acid. The CDC has begun activity in this area, but the continued depth of the problem demonstrates that much more can be done. 
   Another easy thing we can do to bring greater focus and attention to the problem of birth defects is to simply reorganize how and where the work on birth defects is done within the Centers for Disease Control. Right now, the CDC's work on birth defects is done within one of its main branches, the National Center for Environmental Health, whose responsibilities expand significantly beyond birth defects. 
   I believe the seriousness of this problem--over 400 infants are born every day with some type of birth defect--and the significant amount of CDC funding spent on birth defects justify a Center within the Centers for Disease Control focused exclusively on this issue. The Children's Health Act calls for a fourth Center within the CDC--the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities--which will allow for consolidation, greater visibility and expansion of CDC's efforts to prevent birth defects. This builds on the comprehensive prevention program outlined in the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which I sponsored and Congress passed in 1998. 
   One area of children's health that has been getting worse over the last decade is the percentage of babies born with a low birth weight. Low birth-weight babies have a much higher chance of developmental and other problems as they grow up. One reason for this declining trend is the persistent levels of cigarette, alcohol, and drug use during pregnancy. Somewhere between 19 and 27 percent of pregnant women in the U.S. smoke during pregnancy, despite the fact that these smokers are at a significantly higher risk for stillbirth, premature births, low birth-weight, and birth defects. 
   The Children's Health Act contains another provision from my Healthy Kids 2000 legislation which establishes a grant program run by CDC to establish community-based programs designed to reduce and prevent prenatal smoking, alcohol, and drug use. We can work with women to help them understand the consequences of using these types of substances on 
   their babies and to help them change their behavior so they can have healthier infants. 
   The health of a mother during her pregnancy obviously has a tremendous health impact on her child. Yet we as a nation still have a surprisingly large amount of serious complications that occur during pregnancy even before labor. 1,000 women actually die every year during pregnancy, and this figure has been increasing in the 1990s. A full 20 percent of women have serious health problems even before they go into labor. 
   But despite these problems, our public health system does not have a comprehensive system in place to monitor, research, and try to prevent these maternal deaths and complications. Only 15 states have a program of their own that does this. Well, if we can't look at a problem and study it, we certainly can't hope to understand the problem, much less to solve it. I believe the CDC needs to do further work with states to understand exactly why so many women are having pregnancy-related problems and to figure out what we can do about it. The Children's Health Act authorizes CDC to expand their efforts so we can prevent these problems and help women have healthy pregnancies so they can have healthy kids. 
   Finally, I have been a strong supporter of Senator DEWINE's Pediatric  Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of his bill, and I included the Pediatric Research Initiative in my Healthy Kids 2000 legislation. I am happy to report that the Pediatric Research Initiative has been included in the Children's Health Act. 
   I believe we need to encourage the NIH to focus more on children's health care research. In recent years, NIH has seen significant increases in the funding needed to support the critical research they do. This crucial work helps us better understand how various diseases work, what we can do to prevent them, and how to cure those who are afflicted. I am concerned, however, that pediatric research at NIH has not shared fully in this research expansion. 
   The Pediatric Research Initiative provides the NIH with additional funds that are specifically dedicated to pediatric research. This funding can be used by the NIH Director for research that shows the most promise to address successfully childhood health concerns. The Pediatric Research Initiative would not earmark funds to any specific institute or to any specific disease. This commonsense legislation simply provides extra funding to the Office of the Director with maximum flexibility to invest that money in any area of pediatric research in any of the NIH Institutes. I believe this is a reasonable, and not a very restrictive, response to concerns that the NIH shortchanges pediatric research. 
   Mr. President, I would like to commend and thank Senators FRIST, KENNEDY, and all of the other distinguished Senators who have worked to put this crucial bill together. I have been pleased to work with them to ensure that this bill addresses some of the most pressing health care concerns our nation's children face. I hope and expect that the House of Representatives will follow-up quickly on Senate action so we can send this bill to the President. 
   Last year, I introduced the Healthy Kids 2000 Act based on a simple idea--we want children to be healthy, and we want pregnant women to be healthy. Passage today of the Children's Health Act promises to bring us closer to this simple but critically important goal.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the debate before the United States Senate on our granting China permanent normal trade relations status has been a tremendous debate for the country. We have heard strong arguments for and against enhancing our engagement and expanding trade with China. This debate has implications for our economy, national security, and for the future of China. 
   This vote has enormous implications for every American and people around the world. I am pleased that the Senate is proceeding toward a vote on final passage. It will be an honor to support legislation that has such important implications for the people of my state and for our country. 
   Let me say, that is not only desirable from a U.S. standpoint to have China as a full member of the WTO, I think it is essential. China entering the WTO will create unprecedented opportunities for American businesses and farmers, it will encourage the new entrepreneurial forces pushing china toward more liberal political, economic and social policies and it will certainly contribute, if not ultimately lead, to the further stabilization of Asia and the world. 
   From the standpoint of economic growth, increasing our economic relationship with China is imperative. Increased trade has played an indispensable role in the economic growth this country has experienced in recent decades. The leadership and the growth of American companies has been fueled by American companies winning access to new markets. As many U.S. markets continue to mature, market access will play a more important role for the expansion of our businesses. 
   At this time, the U.S. has very limited access to a market representing the largest number of consumers in the world. China is a nation of 1.2 billion people, one-fifth of the world's consumers. Over the next 5 years, it is projected that 200 million of those Chinese will enter the middle class. On a massive scale, these are people who will be acquiring for the first time products that we in the United States take for granted. We owe it to our workers and investors to give our companies an equal opportunity to fight for those sales. 
   Increasing our relationship with a country of this size is also important for maintaining our world leadership in the science, aerospace, advanced technology, and medicine, and most important in all those areas, the well-paying, advanced jobs of the future. 
   Trade is part of the process by which capital, resources and manpower flow to the areas in which we perform best. Reducing restrictions on capital flows has allowed American entrepreneurs to pursue opportunity, create the best, most advanced products in the world, and in these areas, lead the world. 
   Our world leadership in the industries of tomorrow did not happen by accident. In addition to the spirit and ingenuity of the American people, enough policy makers in this country have had the foresight to create an atmosphere where this genius and industry can thrive. Expanding our 
   economic relationship and breaking down barriers to trade with the largest block of consumers in the world is another huge step in that process. 
   To continue to promote that environment where Americans can thrive on a large scale, we need to pass this legislation. 
   But for me, the best reason to support this relationship is that it is good for my state. Whether it is Missouri's farmers, our workers, or our businesses, Missourians will benefit if China is a member of the WTO. 
   Reviewing the numbers for American farmers alone gives a picture as to the staggering opportunities in this market. China is currently our fourth largest agricultural market. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this market will account for 37 percent of the future growth of agricultural exports. And the Chinese have agreed to slash tariffs and eliminate the quotas on several products important to economy of my state--soybeans, corn, cotton, beef, and pork. 
   As China eliminates their legal requirements for self-sufficiency in agricultural products, if they remain only 95 percent self-sufficient in corn and wheat, they will instantly become the second biggest importer of those products in the world, second only to Japan. Missouri farmers are ready to compete for those markets. 
   This is a tremendous opportunity to help our pork producers and cattlemen, both areas in which China has agreed to cut tariffs. Unlike the Europeans, the Chinese are ready for their people to enjoy American beef. They are prepared to eat American beef openly and enjoy it in public. In Europe, only the diplomats who come to the U.S. get to enjoy a good piece of U.S. steak. 
   The Chinese are going to learn quickly what we know and the European diplomats know, American beef is the best. As those 200 million Chinese enter the middle class, I am confident they will enjoy American beef and want more of it. 
   The projected increase for demand of pork in China is simply staggering. Rather than go into the numbers, the pork producers estimate that $5 will be added to the price of a hog when we expand our trade relationship with China. That would be the difference between success and failure for small pork producers. 
   On another issue of great importance to my state and to my farmers, the Chinese have agreed to settle sanitary and phyto-sanitary disputes based on science. What a novel idea. This is essential to avoiding non-tariff trade barriers as our farmers continue to employ biotechnology and advanced agricultural practices. 
   The benefits are not limited to agriculture, despite what has been argued, benefits do extend to manufacturing and other sectors. 
   For example, one company in my state, Copeland, a division of Emerson Electric, manufactures air conditioner compressors in the wonderful town of Ava, MO. Those compressors are sent to China where they are incorporated in units sold all over Asia. As the market for air conditioners 
   in Asia has expanded, the number of manufacturing jobs in Ava have grown. Those jobs will not go to China and if this agreement is passed the manufacturing jobs in the Ava facility are expected to double. 
   This agreement opens competitive opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Under the market opening agreement, the Chinese will eliminate significant market barriers to entry blocking the competitiveness of American companies. 
   For instance, currently, if a product can even be imported into the country, the Chinese control every aspect of movement, right down to who can handle and repair an item. Those requirements will be eliminated as will the state-controlled trading companies. Quotas and tariffs must be published. 
   These are major steps in the direction of a market-based economy. The elimination of these wide-spread and draconian barriers will give American entrepreneurs and small businesses that want to take on the Chinese market a real chance to penetrate and compete. For the first time, American businesses, large and small, will have the chance to compete on a level playing field. 
   It is also worth nothing, that without the benefit of the WTO, to ensure adherence to our trade agreements, we must rely on our federal agencies to oversee and enforce agreements. Frustration with the Chinese regarding their respect for and adherence to past agreements has been expressed. We will receive the benefit of a rules-based trading regime and the weight of enforcement on a multi-lateral basis once China is a member of the body. 
   Some of the opponents argue that this measure is a ``blank check'' for China and that it ``rewards'' China despite the past abuses of its people. The complaints of the human rights activists against China are legitimate. The abuses and repression of religion are deplorable and their gestures toward a free Taiwan are totally unacceptable. 
   I reemphasize that point. We should not tolerate their abuses and their threats toward a free Taiwan. 
   The arguments that we are giving them a pass despite these abuses misses the point and the argument that profits are taking precedence over American values is wrong. This vote is of significant importance in promoting free enterprise in China and creating a increasingly prosperous and reform-minded middle class. 
   For all the backwardness of China on the issue of religious freedom and human rights, positive changes are underway on the economic front--we  should recognize that the changes are a direct threat to the communist establishment in China. As the Chinese people become more aware of the opportunities that exist for improving one's life that are inherent in a free society, they will demand more rights from their government and will demand that the government become more responsive to the will of the people. 
   I have seen that on my visits to China. I am convinced the people of China, as they see these opportunities, will increase their demand for and their insistence on the basic principles that have made our country strong. 
   Senators have come to the floor this week to tell troubling stories about life in China and made arguments as to why it would be a mistake at this time to grant China PNTR. By not supporting their amendments, they have argued, we are betraying our values as a people and we are abandoning support for the principles that make ours a great country. 
   For all their good arguments, passing PNTR and enhancing our economic engagement with China is a concrete opportunity to promote change in many of the areas raised. It is important to discuss these issues and reiterate time and again in the strongest possible terms that we condemn the practices of the Chinese. However, it does not follow that defeating PNTR is the way to force the Chinese to change their behavior. The exact opposite is true. Exposing China to more freedom and opportunities is the way to bring about change. 
   One of the early amendments was in the area of the environment. The argument has been made that we cannot grant the Chinese PNTR because they have been poor stewards of their environment. 
   I remind my colleagues that with every extremely poor country in the world, the struggle to employ their people and raise the standard of living of its citizens is preeminent. People under such circumstances must struggle to feed their families. They are not watching NOVA environmental specials or reading National Geographic. They simply do not have the luxury to worry about the environment. 
   The same applies to the government, creating economic growth to employ the poor citizens is its goal. What China needs is wealth creation, jobs, and enterprise apart from the state. When the desperation and the poverty begin to subside the government is likely to be far more open and responsive to managing the environment. But calling for the denial based on their environmental policies while withholding the best means for the country to raise their standard of living does not offer a solution. 
   The same applies to labor practices. My support for PNTR does not mean that I condone labor conditions in China. In fact I think they are terrible. But is defeating PNTR in order to make a statement about labor practices in China going to improve worker's rights. Absolutely not. 
   The way to improve workers rights in China is allow foreign enterprises into the country, create more private sector jobs and more opportunity. The world buying from the Chinese will create private sector employment and reduce dependence on the government. It creates more choice and opportunity. 
   I share the concerns of my colleagues about Chinese crackdown on religious practices. It is an appalling and unacceptable government practice that we must continue to speak out against. 
   But forcing loyalty to the state and the crushing of all beliefs and values that compete with loyalty to the state is a practice that is common among communist dictatorships. This is the way that leaders in communist countries avoid having the people's loyalty to the state and the question of their purpose in life cluttered by outside influences. 
   Again, will supporting PNTR empower the reform movement? Can promoting free enterprise in China undermine the grip of the government? I think it can. 
   By joining the WTO and pursuing economic engagement and integration with the world, the Chinese communist leadership are taking a risk. 
   They are taking the risk that foreign entities can enter the country and form relationships with Chinese people but the people will still maintain their loyalty to the state. 
   They are taking the risk that their citizens are going to be exposed to the outside world and the freedoms those in American and other countries enjoy but that the Chinese people will not want a piece of that freedom for themselves. 
   They are taking the risk that Chinese people can go to work for private enterprises, with the freedom to pursue better opportunities and with the freedom to innovate, make their own decisions and enrich themselves, but at the end of the day, still maintain the belief that the communist lifestyle, with its per capita income of $790 a year and blind loyalty to the omnipotence of the state is the superior way of life. 
   The Chinese are taking a risk that their people will bear witness to entrepreneurship, capitalism, an improved standard of living, middle class lifestyle and freedom of association, and not recognize that freedom is the better and more rewarding way of life. 
   That is an enormous risk for the Chinese communist leadership to take--I think it is a bet they will lose. 
   Some of my colleagues do not possess this belief. They chose to maintain the most dire outlook on the circumstances. I believe in the virtue and the power of freedom. 
   Some of my colleagues have chosen to shout at the Chinese leaders about freedom, but to most of the Chinese leaders freedom means a loss of power. Much of this rhetoric, as part of a quest for meaningful change, will not do much to advance the ball. The Chinese leadership is not interested in hearing it. 
   Change in China, for the reasons I stated, is not going to come from the top down, at least until there are a lot of high-class funerals in that state, from the actuarial numbers that are about to apply. It is going to come from the bottom up. We must seize any opportunities available to make meaningful change happen. 
   The path to take is the one we are taking and that is to encourage the infiltration of free enterprise, freedom of thought and freedom of association into the current society. It may not happen over night, it may never happen and if it does, it is likely to be messy. But there are signs of movement in a positive direction--we have an opportunity to grease the skids. We would be missing a historic opportunity if we did not seize this chance. My colleagues that oppose this bill are wrong to think otherwise. 
   Not supporting this bill will also hurt the effort to promote the rule of law. There is a reason why a number of dissidents have come out in support of this legislation. The WTO is a rules-based organization that cannot exist if members do not adhere to the rule of law. As a member, China will have both rights and obligations and will have to deal with other nations as equals. Indeed, as a member of a growing number of international organizations, China will continually be subject to the rule of law and continually confronted with the challenge of accepting international norms and, hopefully, standards of freedom. 
   Finally, admission to the WTO is not a substitute for a strong, consistent foreign policy toward China. Certainly one reason why this debate has been difficult is because the administration has lack of a clear foreign policy toward China and the resolve to act on important issues as they arise. In my observation of this administration, it appears to me that they place much hope that admission to the WTO will erase their abysmal record in dealing firmly with China on important issues. 
   We as a nation must reiterate our support for the security of a democratic Taiwan and stand by that country as they negotiate the terms of their relationship with Taiwan. We must support the entry of Taiwan into the WTO and not let China dictate the terms by which this valuable friend and trading partner is admitted to the world trade body. We must provide Taiwan the means by which they can provide for their own security. 
   We must speak out for the freedom of the Chinese people to practice religion. We must speak in favor of increased freedom for the Chinese people. 
   China must be told that we will not tolerate their continued export of weapons technology that can lead to the destabilization of several regions around the world. We must push the Chinese to improve the export controls  and we must be forceful when we discover violations in international antiproliferation agreements. 
   These are not objectives that will be accomplished by defeating PNTR. These are challenges that the current administration has failed to meet. We have not had the adult supervision we need in foreign affairs, in military affairs, and in relations with a critical, large member of the world organizations, and that is China. We have to have an administration which understands foreign policy, which speaks with a clear voice, annunciates our principles, and stands up for them. 
   Defeating PNTR will not give us a strong foreign policy. That will depend upon the next administration. I fervently hope and pray that we will get some decent leadership in foreign affairs beginning next year. We have lacked it. We have been sorrowfully observant of the failures and shortcomings throughout the last 7 1/2 years. Defeating PNTR will not help the next administration in their foreign policy towards China. Approving PNTR will. We must be firm in charting our course in the defense of national security. 
   This is an important step to take for the strength of our economy and for our workers and farmers. It is also an important step to take to move China toward a freer society. We must cast this vote with open eyes. It does not answer the questions surrounding China that have been raised during this debate. That is for the foreign policy of the next administration. By adopting PNTR and voting favorably, we can take the first step in giving the next administration the tools to develop a strong foreign policy with respect to China. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting permanent normal trade relations with China. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to the floor managers of the bill, the chairman and the ranking member. 
   I take the floor today because there is an issue that has been in and out of this body and is currently in conference negotiations. It is also going to be the highlight of the news probably tomorrow. I understand the Vice President is scheduled to talk about the HUB Zone Program. This is a program that I authored in the Committee on Small Business and this body unanimously accepted 3 years ago. I am concerned about it because HUB zones are another example of this administration's record of squandered opportunities. 
   To begin at the beginning, in 1997, the Committee on Small Business reported out legislation to create the HUB Zone Program--historically Underutilized Business Zones. This program seeks to use Federal contracting, Federal purchasing, to generate business opportunities and jobs in the areas of high poverty and high unemployment across the Nation. 
   We created incentives to get small businesses to locate and bring jobs to the distressed areas, areas that usually would not be considered good places to locate in general business judgment. These distressed areas lacked established customer bases, trained workforces. They have been out of the economic mainstream. But the HUB Zone Program was designed to bring small businesses into the area. 
   I came up with this idea after talking with a friend who headed up the JOBS Program in Kansas City. I asked him about bringing more job training programs to the inner city. He said: Stop sending us job training programs; we have trained people and retrained and retrained. He said: Send us some jobs. I thought: there's a good idea. 
   So we set up a program that was designed to reward small businesses located in areas of high unemployment. Unfortunately, when we proposed that idea, immediately the Clinton-Gore administration declared its opposition. I have a letter from the Administrator of the SBA, enclosing a statement of administrative policy:  
   ......the administration remains concerned and opposed to.......provisions relating to HUB Zones.  
   The administration raised a red herring that has dogged the program ever since. The alleged concern was that HUB Zones would somehow harm the 8(a) Minority Business Development Program.

   Mr. BOND. The truth is, the 8(a) program has no reason to fear the HUB Zone Program. In fact, they should be able to work nicely together. The 8(a) program helps to seek minority programs own a greater stake in the economy by focusing on ownership and development of small business. 
   The HUB Zone Program, on the other hand, focuses on developing jobs and opportunities in distressed areas, many of them still minority communities. One brings jobs; the other brings ownership. The two programs are two prongs of the same fork. HUB Zones in 8(a) should not fight with each other but focus on the common threads, such as contract bundling that hurt them and all other small businesses alike. 
   Yesterday, I was pleased to receive a letter from my friends at the National Black Chamber of Commerce in which they recognized how these two programs must work together. Harry Alford, Chamber president and CEO wrote:  
   To date, the Small Business Administration and other agencies have not aggressively pursued the utilization of this valuable vehicle--  
   Referring to HUB Zones.  
   There is a false perception that it is here to replace the 8a program. The author has been guilty of that same fear. In further research and reflection, it appears that the anxiety is unjustified. 8a is in the suburbs and nothing is in the inner city. It will be the HUB Zone activity that will spur a renaissance where economic activity is lacking. We must support the HUB zones.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce an important piece of housing legislation that addresses the affordable-housing needs of needy Americans. The Housing Needs Act of 2000 is a direct response to the affordable housing crisis being experienced by millions of Americans today. By working with State and localities, this legislation will produce thousands of affordable housing units and ensure that existing federally-assisted housing properties are maintained for lower income families. 
   As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, I have become increasingly alarmed by the news reports and housing studies that have shown that lower income Americans are having a difficult time finding decent, safe, and affordable housing. The Administration's response to this problem has been to provide section 8 tenant-based assistance or vouchers. However, I have heard from communities in Missouri to here in the Washington, D.C. area that it is becoming increasingly difficult to use vouchers to find affordable housing. It has also come to my attention that despite the resources given to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal government has lost thousands of scarce affordable housing that were once subsidized by the Federal government. Instead of preserving these scarce and valuable housing resources, the Department has replaced these units with vouchers. While some families have been able to locate replacement housing, many have experienced displacement and hardship, resulting in returning the voucher unused or becoming homeless. 
   Due to these well-publicized problems, I instructed my subcommittee staff to conduct a review of the section 8 program and to provide recommendations on how to meet better the housing needs of lower income Americans. The recommendations of the report are captured in the Housing Needs Act of 2000, which I am introducing today. 
   Before I discuss the contents of the bill, I summarize the key findings of the Subcommittee Staff report entitled ``Empty Promises--Subcommittee Staff Report on HUD's Failing Grade on the Utilization of Section 8 Vouchers.'' The key findings of the report are (1) housing units for low-income families are disappearing; (2) worse case housing needs are worsening; and (3) section 8 vouchers are proving to be less and less effective in meeting the housing needs of low-income families. 
   Specifically, the staff reported that over the past 4 years, nearly 125,000 housing units have been lost to the national inventory of affordable housing. These units have been lost due to the decision of landlords to leave or opt-out of the section 8 program, HUD's policy to voucher out properties that they have acquired title to and those that the Department actually owns.  
   The staff also found that a record high of 5.4 million households have major housing needs. Based on HUD's Worst Case Housing Needs study, many of these households are our most vulnerable individuals such as the elderly, disabled, and children. 
   Lastly, the staff reported that about 1 out of every 5 families that received a voucher are unable to find housing and thus, the voucher remains unused. The report also found not enough landlords were participating in the voucher program, the payment standard of the vouchers were too low for the market area, and voucher holders had personal problems which affected the utilization of vouchers. 
   Mr. President, the staffs' findings were disturbing to me. As a result, I am here today to introduce the Housing Needs Act of 2000 to address the report's findings. 
   Briefly, the legislation creates a new affordable housing block grant production program that would allocate funds to state housing agencies. States currently administer other federal programs such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, HOME block grant program, and the Community Development Block Grant program, which have expanded and increased the capacity of states to create affordable housing units. Thus, state housing finance agencies have the tools to make this program work effectively. I am a big believer in local decision-making. States and localities know and understand their housing problems and needs and are in the best position to make decisions on their housing needs. 
   The legislation would also create a new section 8 success program that would allow public housing agencies (PHA) to raise the payment standard for vouchers up to 150 percent of the fair market rent. This will greatly improve the ability of voucher holders to use the vouchers in economically strong markets. As the Subcommittee Staff report found, 19 percent or one in five families that receive a voucher cannot use it. I believe that this new success program will improve greatly the number of voucher holders actually to use the voucher. 
   Lastly, the bill includes a number of smaller provisions that would enhance the ability of state and local housing entities to produce low-income housing and ensure that HUD maintains section 8 assistance on properties that it has acquired through foreclosure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation. Families all over the country are experiencing hardships never before seen. It is clear that vouchers alone do not adequately address the housing needs of our vulnerable populations. I believe strongly that the Housing Needs Act of 2000 provides a much-needed, flexible, balanced approach to ensure that the affordable-housing problems can be solved.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today the Senate will have 10 minutes for final remarks on the Daschle motion regarding the Missouri River, with a vote to occur at approximately 9:40 a.m. Immediately following that vote, there will be a vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 4444, the China PNTR legislation. 
   Following these votes, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the China trade legislation with amendments in order. The Senate will also continue debate on the energy and water appropriations bill during this evening's session. It is hoped that action on this important spending bill can be completed as early as tonight. Therefore, Senators may expect votes throughout the day and into the evening. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes and ask that I be advised when that is up so I may yield to my colleagues. 
   We have had a lot of argument about whether we ought to stop the process. That is not what is at issue. What is at issue is stopping flooding in downstream States, such as Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and States down the Mississippi, and the implementation of a risky scheme. Section 103--and I am happy to show it to my colleagues--says none of the funds made available may be used to revise the manual to provide for an increase in the springtime water release during spring heavy rainfall and snowmelt in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam. 
   This same provision has been included in four previous energy and water bills in the last 5 years. It has been passed by this Congress and signed by the President. It clearly permits a review of alternatives to change river management. It only prevents one, single, specific harmful alternative of a controlled flood, which was proposed first in 1993, subjected to public review and comment by this Congress, and rejected by the administration when it was considered in 1994. The U.S. Department of Agriculture opposed it. The U.S. Department of Transportation opposed it. There was unanimous opinion on people who lived in and worked along the river. The officials there oppose this risky scheme. Now, 5 years later, the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote a letter on July 12 demanding that, as an interim step, a spring pulse come down the Missouri River starting in 2001. 
   This is supposed to help the habitat of the pallid sturgeon. But what it does is increase the spring rise, and the Missouri and Mississippi already have a spring rise. We get floods and we have damage that hurts land and facilities and kills people. 
   The people of Los Alamos know what happens when the Federal Government gave them a controlled burn. They are still wiping soot out of their hair. This is a proposal to give a controlled flood to areas where there is great risk. That is why the Democratic Governor of Missouri, the mayor of Kansas City, both Democrats, both oppose the motion to strike. They support section 103. We know it would curtail transportation, the most efficient and effective and environmentally friendly form of transportation of agricultural goods, and that is barge traffic. It would end barge traffic on the Missouri River, which I think may be the objective. Barge traffic not only gets product down the river to the world markets, but it keeps the cost of shipping under control by competition. It would harm transportation on the Mississippi River. That is why the Southern Governors' Association and waterways groups have come out in strong support of section 103. 
   Our State Department and Natural Resources Conservation Department oppose this risky scheme. They are dedicated to the recovery of the species. They have other alternatives that need to be and can be studied. The U.S. Geological Survey Environmental Research Center is looking at what we can do to increase the number of pallid sturgeon, and the likely objectives they have do not involve increasing floods in the spring. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in rejecting this motion to strike because it puts lives at risk; it ends transportation for farmers.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the leader. 
   I just have to say when the point was made that this is not about flooding, that is what has people in Missouri scared to death. Floods don't happen every year. But when the floods happen, they are devastating. 
   That is why I want to read from a letter by the Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, of Missouri. In an August 17 letter he wrote to the White House trying to stop it, he said that absent change in the service as planned, it is likely efforts to restore endangered species along the river will be damaged and an increase in the risk of flooding river communities and agricultural land will occur; and, States along the river will suffer serious economic damage to their river-based transportation and agricultural industries. 
   When the Southern Governors Association wrote to the minority and majority leaders, Mike Huckabee, Governor of Arkansas, speaking for the southern Governors, said that if the current plan is implemented and these States incur significantly heavy rains during the rise, there is a real risk that farms and communities along the lower Missouri River will suffer serious flooding. 
   Frankly, nobody can tell when the heavy rains are coming. I have watched the National Weather Service. They do not know. They cannot predict the heavy rains and floods that have devastated our lands and killed people in recent years. They have come without warning. It takes 11 days for water to get from Gavins Point to St. Louis. They are not good enough. None of us is good enough to know when those heavy rains will occur. 
   I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from South Dakota.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact the distinguished Senator from Illinois has said he did not want to see a spring rise in 2001. That basically was what my amendment did.

   Mr. BOND. Their July 10 letter said to the Corps--I used the term ``diktat'' as an authoritarian governmental directive. They tell the Corps of Engineers in the letter of July 12:  
   As an interim step, a spring pulse of 49.5 kcfs from Gavins Point during the first available water year and a summer low of 25 kcfs would be in effect each year, starting in 2001, until the new Master Manual is in place or other appropriate NEPA documentation.  
   Basically what Fish and Wildlife is saying is: Forget about the process.  You, Corps of Engineers, start a spring rise in 2001. 
   That is what we are here about. We pointed out all the problems that the spring rise would provide, the fact that there are very good, scientific judgments coming out of the Missouri Department of Conservation, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and others, saying that a spring rise would have a harmful effect, not only on people along the river, on river transportation, but on endangered species. We have asked the Missouri Department of Natural Resources of the State of Missouri how they view the proposal by the Senator from Illinois. The director of the Department of Natural Resources has just faxed me a letter saying, in pertinent part:  
   Our conclusion is that the proposed Durbin amendment is not protective of Missouri's interests. Nor is it protective of Mississippi River states' interests. The amendment would allow the spring rise and ``split season'' proposal to proceed to the penultimate point of implementation--too late to be stopped or even amended.  
   Basically, the view of the attorney general's office and the State department of natural resources in Missouri is that striking section 103 would open up to the dangers that I laid out last night and this morning of the spring rise and the low summer flow. 
   If the Senator from Illinois agrees that we don't want to have that spring rise and the low summer flows next year, I suggest that we could reach a simple accommodation. Keep section 103. If he wishes to say that studies should go forward on the Missouri River, which is what I firmly believe section 103 does anyhow, we would have no objection to that. But we need to keep that underlying protection that says that you shall not, during 2001, implement the spring rise. That is the purpose of the amendment. That amendment has been in the energy and water bills 4 of the last 5 years, signed by the President. 
   There is no intent for us to stop the discussions. However, the National Academy of Sciences has a very narrow study on the spring rise itself. The studies that are going forward are studies which should include the proposal of the Missouri Department of Conservation which is a 41,000-cubic-feet-per-second flow of the Missouri River which they think will protect the pallid sturgeon and other endangered species and not subject the people of downstream States--Kansas, Missouri, States along the Mississippi, Illinois, down through Louisiana--from spring flooding and will not end the river transportation on the Mississippi and the Missouri. 
   If the only question the Senator from Illinois has is whether or not we cut off studies, I will be happy if he asks unanimous consent to change his amendment so it does not repeal section 103 and states that studies of the Missouri River master manual, all of the studies, shall continue but there will be no spring rise in 2001 as provided in section 103; then I think we can reach agreement. 
   The question has been raised as to whether, even with that modification, that will be acceptable to Members of this body. There are some who appeared to say that would not be acceptable to them. 
   The question has been raised whether the President might veto the entire appropriations bill over section 103 after having signed it for 4 years in a row. We have already shown there is strong bipartisan support in States affected by the Missouri River manual, that a spring rise would be very hazardous to the human life along the river, as well as to farmers who farm in the productive bottom lands, as well as to the water supply, as well as to river transportation. 
   I do not think the President will ignore the strong voices of the flood control associations, the bipartisan, strong opposition of the Democratic government of Missouri, the Democratic Governor and mayors of Kansas City and St. Louis who would be subjected to the dangers of flooding from a spring rise. 
   The President will have to look at the concerns of the people downstream. I think he will realize the scheme is too risky as a result of the action we took today. If the President realizes we are not going to accept the risky scheme of a controlled flood, then maybe we can avoid the need for a vote. 
   If the distinguished Senator from Illinois wants to leave section 103 and work with us to craft an amendment which says that investigations can continue, which is what I believe section 103 will do, if we can muster even greater support, then we will have much less a danger of having this bill vetoed. 
   With that in mind, I am happy to work with the Senator from Illinois because his State is at risk of flooding. A spring rise on the Missouri can threaten flooding in Illinois. A low flow on the Missouri River in the summer and in the fall in navigation season not only threatens and ends barge transportation on the Missouri River, but it puts at risk the river transportation on the Mississippi which carries a very significant bulk of the grain going to the export market. 
   If that is what we are talking about, if we can assure that studies will continue--and I am concerned about the language of his amendment saying we cannot have a final master manual development--that master manual could be implemented so long as it does not include the spring rise--if he is willing to 
   do that, then I say we are on the same page. But I cannot accept and certainly our State governments, the agencies directly involved in the Missouri, cannot accept striking 103. 
   We went through that battle. We spoke, I thought, with a majority vote, saying there shall be no implementation of a spring rise during the year covered by the bill, which is 2001. If we keep that in place, then I will be happy to work with the distinguished Senator from Illinois to fashion a new section 104 which at least makes clear the agreement we may have reached. 
   However, if the Senator still feels the need to strike 103, I have to say that is what we voted on; we have been through this. That is the risky scheme of a controlled flood that we cannot accept, and I do not believe, nor do people in the State of Missouri believe, that his amendment standing alone, unmodified, will do that. 
   I hope, having voted on this and having had the opportunity to tell our colleagues a whole lot more about the Missouri River manual than they ever wanted to know, we might be able to avoid having them vote again. If they vote again, I say to those who supported us, I wish them to continue to support section 103. 
   If the Senator from Illinois will accept keeping section 103 and work with us to craft a section 104 that further clarifies it, I will be happy to do so. Otherwise, I will just ask all the people who voted with us this morning to vote with us again in opposition to the Durbin amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Illinois, with whom I think we have reached an agreement that there should not be a spring rise in 2001. 
   I believe there are some areas that go beyond the existing section 103 on which we might be able to satisfy some of the legitimate concerns raised by the minority leader. He was concerned about the possibility of cutting off debate, cutting off all consideration of other issues relating to the Missouri River manual. That was not our intent. If we can add language that will clarify that, maybe it will at least satisfy some of these problems. 
   Also, we have a Governor and we have other congressional Members from States affected who might want to communicate with the White House about the workability of this. 
   To the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nevada, I appreciate the difficulties they faced. They have both been most accommodating on these issues. We don't want to make life more difficult for them. The Senator from New Mexico may not have river problems, but he has had controlled burn problems. We want to make sure we don't have a controlled flood problem. 
   I am delighted we don't have to ask our colleagues to vote again on this issue tonight. I think there may be further clarification that might satisfy some of the concerns that were raised, certainly by the minority leader. I will be happy to work with them. 
   On behalf of the State of Missouri and the people of the State of Missouri, I express my appreciation to this body for making it clear that there will not be a controlled flood on the Missouri River or abnormally low flows during the summer of 2001, the year to which this appropriations bill applies. 
   As always, we are more than happy to work with the committee leaders in trying to resolve these problems in the future. I thank my colleagues for their understanding of the importance of this issue to the people I represent.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my great honor to rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Missourian who has served our Nation honorably for more then three decades in war and peace. In October, General Terrence Dake, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps,  will retire after more then 34 years of service as a Marine. 
   A native of Rocky Comfort in the Missouri Ozarks, General Dake earned undergraduate degrees from the College of the Ozarks and the University of Arkansas. From there he proceeded to Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, VA. He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant upon graduation from OCS in October 1966. With the echoes of conflict in South East Asia sounding here at home, Second Lieutenant Dake reported directly to aviator training in Pensacola, Florida. He received his wings designating him a Naval Aviator on the 25th of January, 1968. He was tested in combat when he reported to South East Asia and piloted CH-53A Sea Stallion helicopters in Vietnam. Lieutenant Dake earned numerous awards while accumulating over 6,000 flight hours in military aircraft. Highlights of his extensive aviation experience include service as the President's helicopter pilot and as the Commanding Officer of Marine Helicopter Squadron One. 
   General Dake's distinguished career has been accompanied with a rise through the ranks, including service as the Director of Training and Doctrine with the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command and as Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. It is significant to note that this was the largest aircraft wing ever fielded in combat by the Marine Corps. 
   General Dake was promoted to Brigadier General in March, 1992. His assignments as a General Officer included service as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of Aviation; Inspector General of the Marine Corps; Deputy Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; Commanding General, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Aviation. During his time as Deputy Chief of Staff for Aviation the Marine Corps embarked on its historic aviation campaign plan which has manifested itself in the development of the V-22 Osprey and the Joint Strike Fighter. 
   General Dake assumed his present position as the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps on September 5, 1998. For his service as the Assistant Commandant, General Dake was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. General Dake also earned the ``Silver Hawk Award.'' Presented by the Marine Corps Aviation Association, the Silver Hawk Award is given to the active-duty Marine Aviator with the most senior date of designation. 
   Not all of General Dake's achievements took place in aircraft or in command of major units. General Dake's commitment to his troops was evidenced in his efforts in tackling two of the most difficult issues facing the Department of Defense today: health care and readiness. As a member of the Defense Medical and Senior Readiness Oversight Committees, General Dake worked to improve readiness and ensure that the entire military family--active, reserve, and retiree--were provided quality health care. 
   Any tribute to General Dake would be inadequate without recognizing the contributions of his wife and family. As with so many of our fine members of the Armed Services, his career would not be what it is today were it not for their steadfast support throughout the years. Mrs. Dake is a recipient of the Distinguished Public Service Award, presented for her superior public service in support of uniformed personnel and their families. As we pay tribute to him today we also commend and honor her for her commitment and perseverance on behalf of Marines ``in every place and clime.'' 
   I also recognize the other members of General Dake's family. The Dakes have two children, a daughter, Jana, and son, Joshua. Jana is married to Captain Ken Karika, USMC, and is the mother of the Dake's grandchild, Jack. They too have taken part in the sacrifice required to be a military family and deserve our gratitude. 
   The Marine Corps often states that there are no ex-Marines, only Marines who are no longer actively serving. It is comforting to know that General Dake will continue to serve our nation and set an example for others to follow long into the future. 
   As General and Mrs. Dake move from the active duty community to the retired community, it is appropriate that this body stop and honor a man and his family who made countless sacrifices for duty, honor, country.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I certainly concur with my friend from South Dakota on the great words he said about Stephen Ambrose's book, ``Undaunted Courage.'' I know the occupant of the chair read it. A lot of the guys who started out in my State wound up in the State of Oregon. It is truly a masterful piece of work and a wonderful piece of history.  
   I had a great, great, great, great-grandfather who was one of the fellows who poled the barges up the river. He wasn't sufficiently outstanding to get his name in the book. But it is quite an honor to have somebody who went up the river who was with Lewis and Clark. So I have been a great devotee of the river and have followed it a good bit. 
   I was really interested to hear the Senator from South Dakota talk about what we were trying to do to hurt the poor old river. The minority leader claims the provision that he seeks to strike would stop any changes in the Missouri River manual and would keep the plans just as they have been for 50 years. 
   So I thought to myself: Gee, that wasn't the section that I put in. Maybe they changed it somehow in the writing of it. So I went back and read section 103. This is the provision that would be stricken. It says:  
   None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual when it has been made known to the Federal entity or official to which the funds are made available that such revision provides for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.  
   What it says is that you can't implement a plan to increase flooding during spring flood season on the Missouri River during the course of 2001. 
   Contrary to what you have just heard, any other aspect of the process to review and amend the operation of the Missouri River, to change the Missouri River manual, to consider the opinions, to discuss, to debate, to continue the vitally important research that is going on now on the river and how we can improve its habitat will continue. 
   I have been proud to sponsor the Mississippi and Missouri River Habitat Improvement Program in which we funded the Corps of Engineers to make changes to improve the river and to bring it back more to its natural state. It is not going to be all the way back to its natural state but to provide conservation opportunities, to provide spawning habitats, nesting habitats for birds, the kind of habitat we want to encourage the biological diversity on the river.

   Mr. BOND. These organizations represent labor, agriculture, port facilities, flood control districts, and others. They are located in areas as distant as the States of Washington, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. 
   Since this letter was signed, additional groups have asked to join with us in our position in support of section 103. They include the Minnesota Association of Cooperatives, the St. Louis Building and Construction Trades Council, the Minnesota Farm Bureau, the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, and the Minnesota Corn Growers Association. 
   In Missouri, our Department of Natural Resources supports section 103. They oppose raising the spring river height, and they are just as knowledgeable and just as dedicated as the so-called experts at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who want to jump over  the process and impose their particular risky scheme on our State and all the downstream States. 
   I had a very enlightening week traveling from the northwest corner of my State, down the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers, talking with real people, knowledgeable people, scientists, and experts about this proposal. I was joined and supported by members of the Governor's staff. I was joined by the director of our department of natural resources. I was joined by farmers and mayors and chambers of commerce officials, economists and flood control advocates, and other members of our resource agencies. I was joined by representatives of our independent department of conservation--one of the finest departments of conservation in the Nation, one that is looked to as a model, and one that is engaged in ongoing work to preserve the pallid sturgeon and to work with us on reasonable, common sense, scientifically proven ways to assure that we keep the pallid sturgeon. 
   From all of these people I heard firsthand how dangerous the Fish and Wildlife Service plan is and how unnecessary it is. I heard from people who ship the goods on the river now and from people who want to ship on the river in the future but who are withholding investment in river facilities until the uncertainty of the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal is resolved. I have heard from mayors who are worried about the flood risk in the spring. Unless you have been in one of those communities or one of our large cities where a flood has hit, you do not appreciate how devastating a flood is. 
   I have heard from power companies worried about not having adequate water for cooling in the summer. I have heard from farmers who have been flooded and know firsthand that more water in the spring, despite suggestions to the contrary, means more risk of flood. 
   The farmers who live along the river know that even if it doesn't flood, a higher river level in the spring means more seepage under the levees and wetter fields that you cannot plow and you cannot plant. 
   We are here tonight discussing section 103 because despite the views of the Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, the downstream States, the agricultural groups, and the waterway users, the Fish and Wildlife Service is determined to have it their way or no way. The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to experiment with spring flooding. They must think we have forgotten about the controlled burn in Los Alamos. They want to give us controlled floods on the Missouri River in the spring. I say no thanks; we have been there; we have done it; and we don't need the Federal Government making floods worse. 
   This is not a new proposal. It was raised by the Corps of Engineers in 1993, and after public hearings in Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Quincy, Memphis, New Orleans, and elsewhere, the administration went back to the drawing room to find a consensus with the States. Apparently, the Fish and Wildlife Service is not interested in a consensus or we would not be here today. They are not interested in the dangers of increased flood risk or we would not be here today. They are not interested in the public meetings and the viewpoints that were expressed in 1995 or this would have ended then. They want to raise the height of the river in the spring because they think flooding may improve the breeding habitat for the pallid sturgeon. 
   The distinguished minority leader says we ought to be able to act on the best information available. I have asked these people: Where is the information? 
   When I talked with them last week, our resource agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey had not seen any biological opinion. They issued that diktat, that letter of instruction, on July 12. As of last week, the State agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey, with expertise in environmental assessment, a fellow Federal agency, had not seen it. 
   How can we let them go ahead with the scheme when they won't even allow us to look at the basis for their proposal? This truly is a risky scheme. This is one that we cannot tolerate. 
   Our State Department of Natural Resources disagrees with Fish and Wildlife. Our State Conservation Department believes the Fish and Wildlife plan is not necessary. They have presented a plan that does not have spring flooding and no transportation flows in the spring--in the summer and fall. And they believe that plan will do more to help preserve the pallid sturgeon, the least tern, and the piping plover, than this risky scheme put forward by Fish and Wildlife. 
   Our State Conservation Department has an alternative species recovery plan. They cannot get Fish and Wildlife to look at it. Don't you think they would want to look at the various options? Don't you think they would want to consider the evidence before they threaten property and lives with spring floods in Missouri? 
   I have a lot of respect for the difficult and important job of Fish and Wildlife, but let me say this is not about who cares the most about endangered species. The commitment of our Natural Resources Department and our Conservation Department to fish and wildlife is not inferior to that of Fish and Wildlife of the U.S. Government. U.S. Fish and Wildlife does not have a monopoly on dedication and they do not have a monopoly on wisdom. In fact, our Department of Natural Resources has some serious concerns the Fish and Wildlife Service plan may actually harm endangered species rather than help them recover. That fear was expressed by our Governor of Missouri, Governor Carnahan, a Democrat, in a letter to the President 2 weeks ago. Why? Because normally in the summer the natural hydrograph is for the snowmelt to bring the river up. Under this plan, river levels will be going down. That means less water cover. It means burying sandbars where predators might come after the smallest hatch. 
   Fish and Wildlife has a twofold plan. One, it proposes a split season which will end river transportation on the Missouri and do great harm to the river transportation on the Mississippi River. Without water transportation, we are left with a regional railroad monopoly. 
   The minority leader said we initially projected there would be 12 million tons on the river. That is not true. If you look at the 1952 report and the testimony in 1952 and 1956 when they were developing the Missouri River plan, they said 5 million tons. This past year, it was 8 million tons on the river. As I said earlier, there would be a lot more because there is investment out there waiting to happen if we know that Fish and Wildlife is not going to take over the river and get rid of all barge traffic. 
   Barge traffic is the most environmentally sound means of transporting grain to the world markets. It is the most efficient. One barge, one tow with 25 barges, carries the same amount of grain as 870 individual semitrailer trucks that put out far more pollution. Barge transportation bringing inputs to farmers up the river is much more efficient than rail or truck. That lowers the price farmers pay for goods brought in in the spring for Missouri farmers. It lowers them for South Dakota farmers too; the landed price at Sioux City has an impact on what farmers pay. If you got rid of river transportation altogether--which I think may be the ultimate goal. I don't think the Fish and Wildlife Service and the people supporting this just want to flood out the people downstream in the spring; I think there is a greater objective--getting rid of barge transportation altogether. One can only assume that the 
   railroad industry thinks that having no competition is a good idea. But I seriously question whether we, as Senators, should be supporting consolidation rather than competition. 
   The low summer flow proposed by Fish and Wildlife is curious for two additional reasons: One, because it will reduce energy revenues by more than one-third at the dams generating hydropower, particularly during high usage months in the summer. We are about to debate the necessity of a national energy commission to look at how we can meet our growing energy needs, and here we are with a Fish and Wildlife plan to decrease clean hydropower generation. We do not have the luxury of letting existing power capacity go to waste. The low summer flow proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service reduces revenues in the high demand summer months by more than one-third.  
   Another reason the low flow is curious is that, while the Fish and Wildlife Service said they want the river to ``mimic its natural hydrograph,'' historically the highest flows were following the summer snowmelt upstream, and that is the same time Fish and Wildlife demands a low flow. They go the opposite way of their stated objective. 
   This risky scheme has not been subject to adequate analysis and comment by scientists, by people who understand, who live along, work with, and study the river. That is why we say it should not be implemented in the coming year. Let the studies, the debates go on. We would like to see sound science. We would like to see the best information available. Fish and Wildlife has not shown it to us. 
   The fall harvest is approaching. It looks like bumper crops. We have short supplies of storage. As a matter of fact, many elevators, grain elevators, started calling my office saying they do not have rail capacity. The railroads cannot get them the cars they need to carry out the fall harvest, and they are going to have to stop taking in grain that comes in. Two years ago, because of railcar shortages and disorganization, grain was piled up on the ground as it was in the former Soviet Union. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes a complete reliance on that one mode of transportation. 
   Last night on the floor, Senator REID spoke candidly about the value of our Nation's inland waterway system and noted that:  
   To move this additional cargo by alternative means would require an additional 17.6 million trucks on our Nation's highway system or an additional 5.8 million railcars on the nation's rail system. To say what can be handled by our inland water system can be moved by rail or trucks, it simply can't be done.  
   I agree with Senator REID. He is quite right. Fish and Wildlife seeks to eliminate water transportation on the Missouri. But Fish and Wildlife has really thought this through because they have a solution for eliminating the transportation options. They are going to propose, through this plan, to curtail agriculture production by flooding farmers in the spring with high water. As I said earlier, raising the river levels in the spring keeps farmers out of the field. So, as a result of the Fish and Wildlife spring rise, there will be less agricultural production awaiting the transportation that is not available. 
   Doesn't that just gladden your hearts? I mean, the farmers who depend for their living upon raising crops and shipping them economically into the world market--guess what, you are not going to have the transportation. But we will take care of that 
   because we will keep you from having the production. That is why the farmers of Missouri say, ``No thanks.'' 
   Let me speak to a couple of assertions that do not paint a very full picture of the importance of the debate. First, there is the assumption by some that the Missouri River ends suddenly and does not impact the Mississippi River. That is convenient, but it is not true. I have seen the confluence with my own eyes. I know that in low-water years, drought years, dry summers, 65 percent of the flow of the Mississippi River at St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. And to say that the Mississippi barge traffic would love to have that water cut back is absolutely ludicrous. That is why the southern Governors, noting the importance of the Missouri River flow in the Mississippi, have sent a resolution in support of section 103 that the minority leader seeks to strike. 
   Second, there is this notion--we heard it expressed earlier--the Corps will never release extra water in the spring if there is a risk of flooding. Good intention, of course. Give them full credit for trying. But they could only carry out this intention if they could predict the weather perfectly because water released from the South Dakota dam takes 11 days to arrive in St. Louis. A lot of weather can happen in 11 days. 
   Have any of you watched the weather forecasts for the Midwest this summer? I try to keep some trees alive. I watch it. I turn on the weather channel in the morning. It is a lot more informative than some of the morning talk shows. My Farmers Almanac said we were going to have heavy rains in mid-June and the end of June. The week before, 5 days before the middle of June--the middle of July, they said this is a drought season; there is not going to be a drop of water; it is going to be a dry year. The heavens opened up, and we had 5-, 6-, 8-inch rains. A lot of weather can occur in even 3 days. 
   I have a lot of respect for my friend from South Dakota--political miracles we see him perform--but I don't trust him or the Fish and Wildlife Service to predict the weather 11 days in advance downstream. 
   One mistake is all it takes to result in a Government-imposed flood that brings to mind the controlled burn in Los Alamos. That was not supposed to happen, either. The water is not retrievable when it is released. 
   Rainfall in the lower basin will swell the river after the release, and water from the release will only supplement the flood damage. 
   If the water is at your Adam's apple, the Federal Government will do you the courtesy of raising it to your temple. 
   Third, there is already a spring rise as I have stated. If a spring rise is what is needed to recover the species, we ought to have sturgeon all over the place because we had bodacious floods in 1993 and 1995. Those little sturgeons should be popping up all over because we had a spring rise to end all spring rises. It did not happen. 
   Fourth, with respect to water transportation benefits, the Fish and Wildlife Service and my colleague from South Dakota assume that in the absence of competition, the railroad industry will not raise rates on farmers. Try that out on any shipper. Ask anybody in the Midwest who has been captive of the railroad if they really believe that competition does not make any difference. That is the assumption which underlies the small $7 million in benefits from river transportation cited by the opponents of this transportation. 
   If it sounds as if I am picking on the railroad industry, which would be the biggest beneficiaries, along with farmers and producers in Latin America and Australia and Europe, I am not. I have no quarrel with the railroads aiming to maximize their profits. You cannot blame a compass for pointing north. They need to maximize profits. 
   If the Government wants to eliminate their competition, why would they interfere? Every Senator knows, or should know if they studied economics, that in the absence of competition, prices will rise. We see prices rise at the end of the navigation season. On the Mississippi, we see prices rise when locks are closed for maintenance. 
   There is a Fortune 100 firm on the Mississippi River that has built a river terminal it has never used except when it negotiates with the railroads. It has that river terminal, and the railroads come in and say: We are going to charge you x amount for bringing your product in. And they say: We will just open up this river terminal, and we will beat your prices down. They come around. 
   According to the Tennessee Valley Authority which did a study on the Missouri River, the savings to rail shippers because of competition created by barge traffic is an estimated $200 million annually. That is the benefit to shippers. Those people get goods coming in and those shipping commodities out. That includes benefits worth $56 million to shippers in Missouri, $43 million to shippers in Iowa, $36 million to shippers in Nebraska, and as the occupant of the Chair will be interested to know, $52 million to shippers in Kansas, and $14 million to shippers in South Dakota. 
   In summary, flood control is important, energy production is important, and having modern and competitive transportation options for our farmers and shippers is important. 
   With respect to the species, our resource agencies say the Fish and Wildlife Service is wrong and their plan is harmful and unnecessary. That is why I included the provision for the fifth year. This provision does not stop the process as has been 
   alleged by my colleague. It simply says the water management manual cannot be changed to force a dangerous spring rise. It is a risky scheme on which we cannot afford to gamble. It is a controlled flood that is not controllable. 
   Ten years ago, the courts decided to review the river management. Seven  years ago, it proposed a spring rise. It was opposed in public hearings from Sioux City to Memphis to New Orleans. It was opposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It was opposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. It was opposed by agriculture and other shippers. 
   Twenty-seven Senators in a bipartisan letter to the President opposed it. So in 1995, the administration rejected the spring rise and went back to the drawing board. The President ordered the Corps to work with the States to find a consensus. Meanwhile, Congress included section 103 four different times to remind the Fish and Wildlife Service that their obsession to increase flooding was not acceptable. 
   Last year, seven out of eight States arrived at a consensus that the Corps accepted which did not include a spring rise. Then, notwithstanding the public hearings in 1994, the letter to the President, the legislative provisions, notwithstanding the consensus, the Fish and Wildlife Service arrogantly pushes the same old plan to raise the river height in the spring.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of section 103, and I yield myself such time as I may consume to make my remarks. 
   Section 103 of this bill is a provision that is necessary for the millions of Americans who live and work along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. But before I get into detailing those considerations, let me commend Senator BAUCUS and the Senate Appropriations Committee for including section 103 in the energy and water appropriations bill. 
   This section protects the citizens of my State of Missouri and other States from dangerous flooding and allows for cost-efficient transportation of grain and cargo. Of course, cost-efficient transportation provides a basis for much of our industry and agriculture. 
   The pending amendment would delete section 103 in the underlying bill, thereby sanctioning the Fish and Wildlife Service's attempt to bully the Corps of Engineers into immediately changing the river's water management plan to include a spring rise which would increase flood risk on the lower Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. 
   This is not just a dispute between the States of Missouri and the Dakotas. It is a much larger issue. It is about whether we will prevent unnecessary administrative intrusion into the operation of the Missouri or any U.S. river, and whether the public it is about should have the opportunity to review proposed changes and whether we should allow a disputed biological opinion to be the subject of independent scrutiny. 
   Without section 103, decades of operating the Nation's commercially navigable rivers for multiple purposes will be reversed without clear congressional direction. 
   Joining us in urging defeat of the pending amendment is a bipartisan collection of people and organizations representing farmers, manufacturers, labor unions, shippers, cities, and port authorities from 15 Midwest States. Also supporting us in opposing the Daschle amendment are major national organizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the American Waterways Association, the National Grange, and the National Soybean Association. 
   We are united in opposing this amendment because of the risk. It would lead to a dangerous flooding condition and could interfere with the movement and cost of grain and cargo shipped on our Nation's inland waterways. 
   It is not a novel thing for me to stand in defense of the Missouri River. I come to this debate after fighting for Missouri's water rights as the Missouri attorney general and Governor, and I will continue to make water flows on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers top priorities. 
   As background for this debate, Senators need to know that the use of the Missouri River is governed by what is known as the Missouri River Master Manual. Right now, there is an effort underway to update that manual. The specific issue that is at the crux of this debate today is what is called a spring rise. A spring rise in this case is a release of huge amounts of water from above Gavins Point Dam on the Nebraska-South Dakota border during the flood-prone spring months. 
   To see whether such a controlled flood may improve the habitat of the pallid sturgeon, the least tern, and the piping plover, section 103 is a commonsense provision that states:  
   None of the funds made available in this act may be used to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if such provisions provide for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.  
   This policy has been included in the last four energy and water appropriations bills, all of which the President signed without opposition. 
   In an effort to protect the species' habitats, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued an ultimatum to the Army Corps of Engineers insisting that the U.S. Corps of Engineers immediately agree to its demand for a spring rise. The Corps was given 1 week to respond to the request of Fish and Wildlife for immediate implementation of a spring rise. The Corps' response was a rejection of the spring rise proposal, and they called for further study of the effect of the spring rise. 
   The Bond language in section 103 will allow for the studies the Corps recommends. 
   National environmental groups want to delete section 103. They want to do that in an attempt to circumvent additional analysis of the effects of the proposal. 
   What is ironic and even tragic is that spring flooding could hurt the targeted species more than it would protect them, and it would do so in a way that would increase the risks of downstream flooding and interfere with the shipment of cargo on our Nation's highways. 
   Dr. Joe Engeln, assistant director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, stated in a June 24 letter that there are several major problems with the Fish and Wildlife's proposed plan that may have a perverse effect of harming the targeted species rather than helping the targeted species. 
   First, Dr. Engeln points out that the plan would increase the amount of water held behind the dams, which would have the effect of reducing the amount of river between the big reservoirs by about 10 miles in an average year and a reduction in certain parts of the river. 
   In addition, Dr. Engeln writes, ``The higher reservoir levels would also reduce the habitat for the terns and plovers that nest along the shorelines of the reservoirs.'' 
   Dr. Engeln also points out that because the plan calls for a significant drop in flow during the summer, predators will be able to reach the islands upon which the terns and plovers nest, giving them access to young still in nests. 
   It is clear there isn't a single view about the value, even in terms of seeking to protect these species which are the focus of this debate. 
   Some advocates of the proposed plan claim this plan is a return to more natural flow conditions. They say, we want to return the river to its condition at the time of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Not only is it unrealistic to return the river to its ``natural flow'' when the Midwest was barely habitable because of erratic flooding conditions, according to Dr. Engeln,  
   The proposal would benefit artificial reservoirs at the expense of the river and create flow conditions that have never existed along the river in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri.  
   Dr. Engeln's letter states:   
   Balancing the needs of all river users is complicated. Predicting the loss of habitat and its impact on the terns and plovers should not be subject to disagreements. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps of Engineers need to examine the implications of this proposal and recognize its failure to protect these species.  
   Listen to the last comment: The Missouri Department of Natural Resources--I might note, this is a well-recognized department; our conservation and natural resource departments are nationally recognized. We are especially supportive, with special independent tax revenues for the conservation commission. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources states that the Fish and Wildlife Service should recognize the proposal's failure to protect these species. 
   The plan by the Fish and Wildlife Service fails to protect species. It exposes the citizens of the Midwest and Southern States and their farms and cities and ports to dangerous flooding. It also interferes with the shipment of cargo and could lead to higher prices being charged for the shipment of cargo. 
   Over 90 organizations representing farmers, shippers, cities, labor unions, and port authorities sent a letter to Congress last week that Senator BOND has had printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Let me briefly quote from this letter:  
   The spring rise demanded by the Fish and Wildlife Service is based on the premise that we should ``replicate the national hydrograph'' that was responsible for devastating and deadly floods, as well as summertime droughts and even dust bowls.  
   The letter goes on to say:  
   For decades we have worked to mitigate the negative implications of the natural hydrograph with multiple purpose water resource programs. These efforts have protected communities from floods and also provided hundreds of thousands of families wage jobs in interior regions.  
   These 90-plus organizations are exactly right. For decades, the Government has made water resource management decisions by taking into account the many varied uses of the river in balancing the interests of all affected groups: agriculture, energy, municipal, industrial, environmental, and recreational. Our policies in the past have been designed to protect communities against natural disasters, as well as allow efficient and environmentally friendly river transportation, low-cost and reliable hydropower and a burgeoning recreation industry. 
   Let me indicate when I was attorney general of the State of Missouri--and that is several decades ago--there was a run made on the river at that time to divert the river, to run it through a pipeline to the lower Gulf States and to run the river in conjunction with powdered coal through the pipeline as a means of taking the river. 
   I guarded the river then because I knew of its value to our State. Half the people in the State of Missouri drink water from the Missouri River. It is a tremendous resource in terms of transportation, in moving grain downstream for international sale. Soybean farmers in America have to sell over half of their crop overseas. Moving their crop to the ports is essential. Moving the crop efficiently to the ports is very important in terms of our competitive position. It is a necessary thing that we preserve this potential for those who operate our family farms--not just to have the transportation--to avoid the unnecessary and devastating potential of floods. 
   Last week, the sponsors of the pending amendment circulated a Dear Colleague letter regarding their amendment. It is a letter to explain their idea of striking section 103. They laid out the arguments. The environmental groups who are supporting the Daschle amendment have made many of the same points in defense of their position. I want to take a few minutes to refute the main points of the supporters of this amendment, which is to strike this provision. 
   First, the supporters argue that the Missouri River management changes will not create potential downstream flooding because the spring rise would not occur every year. It would not be implemented during the 10 percent highest flow years, they say, ``and the Corps would not release additional water from Gavins Point dam if the Missouri were already flooding.'' 
   While this may sound reassuring, it is not acceptable to those citizens living downstream because unreliable waterflows pose a grave danger to everyone living and working along the banks of the river. The spring rise would come at a time in the year when downstream citizens are most vulnerable to flooding and downstream agriculture is certainly very vulnerable to flooding. 
   It normally takes 11 or 12 days for water to travel from the Gavins Point reservoir to St. Louis. During the spring, the weather in the Midwest is unpredictable. I might want to protect myself. It may be that the weather in the Midwest is always predictable. 
   I remember last summer visiting a flood-ravaged city in eastern Missouri in this watershed. Union, MO, had a 14-inch rain that was not predicted. I had flooding on my farm in late July when we had a 7-inch unpredicted rain. And not only just this kind of outburst or cloud burst, but we know that the weather in the Midwest is hard to predict. Heavy rain or a series of heavy rains in the 12-day period following a spring rise would certainly greatly increase the chances for downstream flooding, and the amount that would be necessary to top a levy here and there could be the amount precipitated with the rise, the purposeful release of the water. 
   The second major point the opponents make is that section 103 prohibits the Corps from producing a final environmental impact study. The true fact is the language of section 103 only forbids the use of Federal funds to make revisions of the master manual to allow for a spring rise. It does not impact the Corps' ability to produce a final environmental impact study, 
   nor does it permanently ban revisions. Section 103 would only be operative for fiscal year 2001. 
   The third point that the opponents make is that the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal will help Mississippi barge navigators. The true fact is every Mississippi navigational organization and transportation entity is against the proposed spring rise and in support of section 103. They say these folks will all be assisted by this. But all the folks who actually work in this industry, every single navigational organization says that kind of assistance ``we don't want.'' It is akin to the fellow saying: I don't think the check is in the mail and I don't think you are from the Federal Government and here to help me. 
   The fourth point that our opponents make is that the Missouri River farmers will benefit by the proposed management changes. The real fact is that every farm group is against the proposal and is in favor of retaining section 103. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the American Soybean Association, the National Grain and Feed Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, Agriculture Retailers Association--enough. 
   The fifth point our opponents make is that public recreational opportunities in upstream States will be improved by the proposed changes. According to the mark 2,000 set of groups, no evidence exists to suggest that recreation and tourism will benefit from a spring rise. 
   The sixth point our opponents make is that the spring rise will help to restore the health of the river and recover endangered fish and bird species. No documentation has been provided that establishes the need for a spring rise beyond what currently occurs naturally. 
   As I mentioned before, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources strongly disagrees that a spring rise would have environmental benefits for endangered birds. 
   The seventh point our opponents make in their letter is that the only industry harmed by the proposal would be the downstream barge industry. They don't always make this point. Sometimes they say this will not make any difference to the barge industry. Sometimes they say it is going to help the barge industry. Then they say the only industry that would be hurt would be the barge industry. I think what we can all agree on is the barge industry would be affected, and I think we ought to listen to the barge industry. The barge industry simply says very clearly they don't want any part of this, that they reject this concept. 
   Competition on the waterways, of course, would be impaired. If you hurt the barge industry, it is totally naive  to think that you can hurt the barge industry and that would be the only industry hurt. If you hurt the barge industry and take that grain shipment capacity out of the system, all of a sudden you have to load more trucks. So there would be a greater demand for trucking. With more demand, we all know what happens: Supply and demand, if the supply is the same the price goes up. In fact, it doesn't take a particularly strong analytical bent to get there. But the Tennessee Valley Authority has made some estimates about this. According to the TVA, water competition holds down railroad rates, not only trucking rates but railroad rates, and the holddown of the railroad rates by water competition is about $200 million each year. 
   If you are talking about that kind of impact holding down those rates, I think it is fair to say there are potential ripple effects on a lot of other folks than just the barge industry, and I happen to believe this is a time when the American farmer might find himself on the tracks and the fast freight coming through, and not for the benefit of the American farmer. It is time for us to say we need as much competition as possible in hauling these resources to market rather than to minimize that competition. 
   Finally, the amendment sponsors say the President will veto this bill if section 103 is maintained. If the President decides to veto the entire bill after having signed this provision four times previously, it states a very clear message by the Clinton-Gore administration to the citizens of the Midwest. It is very easy to understand. Unfortunately, it would be very hard to digest and accommodate. But the message would be this: The Clinton-Gore administration is willing to flood downstream communities as part of an unscientific, risky scheme that will hurt, not help, the endangered species it seeks to protect. If that is the message, I wouldn't want to be the messenger. A vote for the Daschle amendment sends the message to communities all along the Missouri River that this Congress supports increased flooding of property and higher costs for family farmers, factory workers, and industrial freight movers. 
   I think it is pretty clear that there is not sound science to support some protection of these species. There is a clear disagreement among scientists, and a strong argument that the implementation of this plan would, in fact, damage the capacity of some of these species to continue. 
   I urge Senators to look closely at the facts and to stand with the men and women who depend upon sane, scientific management of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, and to join me in voting no on the Daschle amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, which I hope ends this debate for this group who is listening in rapt attention. I appreciate the attention of those people who are sitting  on the edge of their seats learning more than they ever wanted to know about the Missouri River. It is important to us. It is vitally important to Missouri and other downstream States. 
   We do disagree with some of the statements that have been made by my colleagues on the other side. We have a disagreement on the interpretation and I think a disagreement on the facts. 
   The statement has been made that the Fish and Wildlife Service's split season does not have any impact on the river flows in the Mississippi River. That has not happened. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposal, according to the Corps of Engineers' advice to us today, has not happened. That is not accurate. 
   I believe strongly the spring rise will take water out of upstream reservoirs. They need that water for recreation. I have worked very closely with my friend and colleague from Montana, and others, to do what we can to accommodate legitimate recreation needs. My colleague from Montana was a very valuable ally when we pushed through the middle Missouri River habitat mitigation plan that made changes that we think are improving fish and wildlife habitat along the Missouri. I thank him for that. 
   When he says the models show there is a statistically insignificant impact downstream, any kind of spring rise in any year which is an exceptional flood year is going to have exceptional and disastrous impacts. Look at it in a low-flow year. It may not make much difference, but if you put that spring surge down the river in a year when we get that unexpected 6-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, 14-inch rise, we have a devastating flood that not only wipes out property and destroys facilities along the river but puts lives at danger. 
   The statement was made that fish and game agencies are united behind this plan. They are not. This is one of the big questions that needs to be resolved. Resolution of those questions can and must go on during the coming year. We do not stop all of the agencies from continuing the discussions and debate. Contrary to what has been said on this floor by the proponents of the motion to strike, we only say you cannot implement the spring rise. 
   This risky scheme needs to be thoroughly worked out, thoroughly debated, before anybody has a thought of putting it into action. That is why we want to have a year with no spring rise implemented as ordered by the diktat of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their letter of July 12. 
   The statement was made that the consensus of the States in the Missouri River Basin Association was in favor of a spring rise. There is a difference between a spring rise in the upper part of the river which is above the dams, above Gavins Point, which makes the difference on what the flows are in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska. 
   The Missouri River Basin Association recommends trial fish enhancement flows from Fort Peck Reservoir. The enhanced flows will be coordinated with the unbalancing of the upper basin reservoirs and thus will occur approximately every third year. This is in the upper basin. It does not have any impact directly downstream. 
   With respect to the lower Missouri River, which is below the last dam--that is, Gavins Point releases--the statement of the Missouri River Basin Association is that it recognizes the controversial nature of adjustment to releases from Gavins Point Dam. MRBA recommends the recovery committee investigate the benefits and adverse impacts of flow adjustment to the existing uses of the river system. They did not, have not, and are not recommending increased flows. 
   This effort by the Fish and Wildlife Service to impose their views over the views not only of the neighbors of the people downstream who have studied it, the fish and wildlife agencies, this is a risky scheme that provides tremendous potential for a flooding disaster along the Missouri River, and I urge my colleagues tomorrow to oppose the motion to strike.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time on this side and bring this to a blessed conclusion after stating that I appreciate the chance to discuss this issue with my good friend from Montana and to say we are willing to let the process go forward. Just do not send us a controlled flood next spring. That is all we ask. Let the process work. Do not send the water down. 
   I now yield back the time on this side.

   Mr. BOND. When the Senate convenes at 9:30 a.m., there will be 10 minutes remaining for closing remarks with respect to the motion to strike the Missouri River provision contained in the energy and water appropriations bill. Immediately following that vote, a vote will occur on the motion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation. Therefore, two back-to-back votes will occur at approximately 9:40 a.m. Following those two votes, the Senate will consider the China PNTR bill. It is hoped that agreements can be reached on various amendments to the bill and, therefore, votes can be expected to occur throughout the day. 
   As a reminder, the filing deadline for all first-degree amendments to the energy and water appropriations bill was 6:30 this evening. As a further reminder, the Senate will continue to consider the China trade bill and the energy and water appropriations bill on a dual track for the remainder of the week, with votes expected throughout each day.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our colleague from Illinois and others have talked about the things we have not passed and that they would like to see passed in this session. But we have a big problem. We have a problem because the absolutely essential work that this body must do is being held up. The work on appropriations bills that fund the agencies of Government for the next year must be done before the end of the fiscal year--September 30. 
   Many of the things my colleague has talked about have already been passed and are in conference. But we can't get floor time to do it when we are dealing with filibusters. The Democratic plan has been to stall, delay, and block. 
   We will have an opportunity to vote on cloture on the Treasury-Postal bill. That means cutting off a filibuster. But that goes through the lengthy process of the 30 hours that are required for debate. 
   We are also ready to take up the energy and water appropriations bill. But the minority leader has raised objection to that. 
   Energy and water carries many important things. It carries funding for projects that are vitally important to South Dakota--to river States such as Missouri, to the Nation, the national laboratories in New Mexico, and others. 
   All of these vital appropriations are being held up because the minority leader is now objecting to a provision that was included in the bill this year but has been included in four previous bills Congress has sent to the President and which have been signed by the President. 
   The state of affairs is, we are ready for a time agreement. If there are objections to particular items in a bill, we have a process called amendments. You can move to strike; you can move to amend. We are ready to do business. 
   Let there be no mistake. Let the American people understand. We are watching a series of Democratic stall, moves--delay, stall, and block. Sometimes we call them a filibuster. But filibusters don't need to be people talking on the floor. It can be refusal to allow a bill to come up. It can be filibustered by amendments. Basically, it is the Democratic side that is trying to keep the Senate from doing its work. 
   We have lots of important votes. They may win; we may win some. The Senate has its rules. It permits debate and amendment. We are willing to do so and debate a commonsense provision that happens to be in this bill to see what the will of the Senate is. 
   The provision in the bill as reported out of committee that has existed in four previous appropriations bills, previously signed by the President, is designed to prevent changes to Missouri River management which would increase the risk of spring flooding and bring many dire consequences. I intend to lay out some of the problems and a number of leaders in this country who oppose it. 
   The provision is very simple. It is also very important. The provision is designed to stop flooding. Out West we hear the Fish and Wildlife Service is now proposing to tear down dams. Here the Fish and Wildlife Service wants to take action on flow management to pretend that dams don't exist. They have gone out of their way to try to dictate the work of the Corps of Engineers. There are all kinds of procedures--there are public hearings, there are assessments, there are impact statements, and many other things--required before an agency can take action. The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to jump over all that and say: Corps of Engineers, you do our bidding. They sent a letter on July 12 which said: You must establish a plan to increase spring flooding on the Missouri River and to cut off the possibility of effective barge transportation, environmentally sound barge transportation in the summer and the fall, affecting not only the Missouri River but the Mississippi River as well. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to do to the communities, to the States along the Missouri River, what the National Park Service did to the community of Los Alamos when it tried a control burn. We don't need a controlled flood that the Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed. 
   While we have a lot to debate with our friends in the upper basin about the way the river is managed, I never expected they would ever support an action simply designed to increase downstream flooding. As far as I know in the debates--and they have been vigorous debates in the past--that was never their intent. I don't know what the intent now is of the minority leader. We have fought vigorously and honestly with our friends in the upper river States about their desire to keep fall water for their recreation industry. We want to work out ways to help them. We need that late year water to ensure we keep river transportation so our farmers have an economical and environmentally sound way of getting their products to the market. We also need flood control. We have never had them complain about flood control. Dams were built in 
   the middle of the last century, principally to prevent flooding on the lower Mississippi and lower Missouri Rivers. Mr. President, 85 percent of the population in the Missouri River basin lives in the lower basin below Gavin's Point. That doesn't include the lower Mississippi River which gets that water from the Missouri. 
   As with the dams out West, the Fish and Wildlife Service has a theory that we should travel back in time and have rivers that ``mimic the natural flow of the river.'' Dams were built to stop the natural flow because the natural flow was flooding many hundreds and thousands of acres. It was killing people and damaging billions of dollars of property. One third of our State's food production is in the floodplain of the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. In 1994, the Corps of Engineers proposed to change the river and have a spring rise. 
   On a bipartisan basis, we communicated our opposition to the President. Twenty-eight Senators representing States along the Missouri and Mississippi and Ohio Rivers signed this letter to the President. The Corps went back to the drawing board and began fresh to develop a consensus plan. Between then and early this year, a consensus among the States--with the exception of Missouri--was developed that included conservation measures but had no spring rise. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, at the table with the States for years, came to Washington, and the next thing we know they are insisting on a spring rise, the will of the States, the comments of the people, the overwhelming objection of State and local officials notwithstanding. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn't want public comments. They heard them. They know what the comments are. Don't flood us out. The Fish and Wildlife Service has no mandate to protect people from the dangers of flooding. I invite them out the next time we have a spring flood in Missouri to see the devastation, to comfort and console the families who have lost loved ones in floodwaters. We lost some this year in floods in Missouri. The public has gone on record strongly opposing this spring rise. In 1994, the public opposed it, from Nebraska to St. Louis to New Orleans to Memphis and beyond. To prevent the risk of downstream flooding in 1995, Congressman BEREUTER from Nebraska put a provision in the energy and water appropriations bill to block any change in river management that included a spring rise.  The same provision was included again in 1996, 1998, 1999, and again by the Senate subcommittee. As I repeat, this provision has been adopted by voice vote in the House and has been included in four previous conference reports, signed by the President four times before. 
   Let me note two additional realities. According to our State Department of Natural Resources, not only is this plan experimental, but it could injure species. I quote from the assistant director for science and technology who said the plan calls for a significant drop in flow during the summer. This will allow predators to reach the islands upon which the terns and plovers--the endangered species--nest, giving them access to the young still in the nest. While the impacts on the pallid sturgeon are more difficult to determine because we know less about them, low flows during the hottest weather may pose a significant threat. In other words, there is a real danger to the environment and to the endangered species.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our Department of Natural Resources representatives are as green and pro-environment as any group around. They believe it is a bad idea. Farm groups oppose it. The ports and river transportation and flood control people oppose the spring rise. The Southern Governors' Association opposes the spring rise. 
   There should be an important conservation element in any balanced plan, but balance is not in the Fish and Wildlife Service mandate nor in its plan. They want to manage a river solely for critters. We need to have it managed for people. We cannot have the next flood laid at the doorstep of the Congress that is now considering whether to experiment with the lives and property of millions of people who live along the river. 
   Some say the President may veto the bill, but he signed it four times before. If he were to do that, he could answer to the people from Omaha to Kansas City to Jefferson City to St. Louis to Cape Girardeau to Memphis down the delta to New Orleans. 
   I urge my colleagues to move forward on this bill. We can debate this provision, but I believe it is important for safety.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted the acting minority leader has brought up the energy and water measure because I have just received some very disturbing news, that the minority leader has indicated we can't bring up the energy and water bill unless a provision that was in the bill signed last year, that was in the bill signed the year before, that was in the bill signed the year before that and the year before that--he now finds it objectionable, and he will not let this bill be brought up unless we strike it out. 
   This provision deals with the spring rise on the Missouri River that Fish and Wildlife thinks is a good idea. But all of the people downstream know it would cause flooding, hardship, damage, property loss, and loss of lives from floods.  
   This is a serious matter. It also threatens commerce and transportation, not just on the Missouri River but on the Mississippi River, because in dry years, 65 percent of the flow of the Mississippi at St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. If they have a spring rise, there isn't water to maintain river transportation during the summer and the fall. 
   I had understood, from the minority leader's staff, that he wanted a time agreement so he could move to strike it. I think this matter needs to be aired. We are willing to enter into a time agreement, so on Monday or Tuesday--whenever he wants--we can talk about the reason that this was included in the bill last year, the year before, the year before, and the year before that, because it is of vital importance to our State and to other States on both the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers. 
   We have a way of doing business around here and that is, the committee acts and they report out a bill; the bill comes to the floor. If somebody does not like a provision in the bill, they have a right to move to strike it. That right is totally protected. We are trying to get appropriations bills passed. 
   Frankly, I do not want to be held hostage by an idea that the minority leader has, that all of a sudden we can't put a provision in this year's bill that was in last year's bill and the bill the year before that. 
   I call on the minority leader to follow through with the commitment to have a time agreement. If he wants to move to strike it, fine. We have a lot of good reasons, and we want to let our colleagues know why that provision needs to be kept. 
   I do not want to be held hostage by the minority leader saying, we are going to stop the appropriations process unless you take it out of the bill--a measure that is vitally important to the State of Missouri, to the States of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. I am ready to talk about and argue against the minority leader's motion to strike. But to say that we can't even bring up the bill with that 
   provision in it is, I think, inappropriate, unwise, and unprecedented. 
   So I am here. I will be back here on Monday or Tuesday to do business. I just ask that the minority leader let us bring up the bill. This is an unbelievable effort to hold a bill hostage because of a particular interest he may have in that bill. He can deal with it by an amendment to strike, a motion to strike--whatever he wants. But let us bring the bill up because there is too much that is important in it to have it be held hostage by an effort to say what can be in the bill, approved by the committee, where somebody does not like something in the bill. 
   There is a remedy: A motion to strike or a motion to amend. We will be here to do business Monday, Tuesday--whenever the minority leader wants. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Nevada, if we pass a bill out of committee, what is the precedent for saying, oh, we have to change it before you even bring the bill to the floor, the measure that is reported out of the committee? 
   We have a process around here. There are many things that come out of committees that we disagree with. We have the option to change it on the floor. We need to move forward. Energy and water is vitally important. 
   I appreciate the excellent work my colleague from Nevada does on this and other measures. But why, for Heaven's sake, are we supposed to hold an entire bill hostage because a single Senator wants to strike something out of a measure that has been adopted at the subcommittee and full committee level? I just do not understand why we can't do this in the normal course of business.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000 (H.R. 2392) was introduced on June 30, 1999, and referred to the House Committees on Small Business and Science. Both Committees held hearings and the House Committee on Small Business reported H.R. 2392 on September 23, 1999 (H. Rept. 106-329). In the interest of moving the bill to the floor of the House of Representatives promptly, the Committee on Science agreed not to exercise its right to report the legislation, provided that the House Committee on Small Business agreed to add the selected portions of the Science Committee version of the legislation, as Sections 8 through 11 of the House floor text of H.R. 2392. H.R. 2392 passed the House without further amendment on September 27. The Science Committee provisions were explained in floor statements by Congressmen SENSENBRENNER, MORELLA, and MARK UDALL.  
   On March 21, 2000, the Senate Committee marked up H.R. 2392 and on May 10, 2000, reported the bill (S. Rept. 106-289). The Senate Committee struck several of the sections originating from the House Committee on Science and added sections not in the House-passed legislation, including a requirement that Federal agencies with Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs report their methodology for calculating their SBIR budgets to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and a program to assist states in the development of small high-technology businesses. Negotiations then began among the leadership of the Senate and House Committees on Small Business and the House Committee on Science (hereinafter referred to as the three committees). The resultant compromise text contains all major House and Senate provisions, some of which have been amended to reflect a compromise position. A section-by-section explanation of the revised text follows. For purposes of this statement, the bill passed by the House of Representatives is referred to as the ``House version'' and the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business is referred to as the ``Senate version.''  
   Section 1. Short Title; Table of Contents. The compromise text uses the Senate short title: ``Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000.'' The table of contents lists the sections in the compromise text. 
   Section 2. Findings. The House and Senate versions of the findings are very similar. The compromise text uses the House version of the findings. 
   Section 3. Extension of the SBIR Program. The House version extends the SBIR program for seven years through September 30, 2007. The Senate version extends the program for ten years through September 30, 2010. The compromise text extends the program for eight years through September 30, 2008. 
   Section 4. Annual Report. The House version provides for the annual report on the SBIR program prepared by the SBA to be sent to the Committee on Science, as well as to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business that currently receive it. The Senate version did not include this section. The compromise text adopts the House language. 
   Section 5. Third Phase Activities. The compromise text of this technical amendment is identical to both the House and Senate versions. 
   Section 6. Policy Directive Modifications. The House version includes policy directive modifications in Section 9 and the requirement of a second phase commercial plan in Section 10. The Senate version includes policy directive modifications in Section 6. The Senate version and now the compromise text require the Administrator to make modifications to SBA's policy directives 120 days after the date of enactment rather than the 30 days contained in the House version. The compromise text drops the House policy directive dealing with awards exceeding statutory dollar amounts and time limits because this flexibility is already being provided administratively. Addressed below is a description of the policy directive modifications contained in the compromise text that were not included in both the Senate version and the House version. 
   Section 10 of the House version requires the SBA to modify its policy directives to require that small businesses provide a commercial plan with each application for a second-phase award. The Senate version does not contain a similar provision. The compromise text requires the SBA to modify its policy directives to require that a small businesses provide a ``succinct commercialization plan for each second phase award moving towards commercialization.'' The three committees acknowledge that commercialization is a current element of the SBIR program. The statutory definition of SBIR, which is not amended by H.R. 2392, includes ``a second phase, to further develop proposals which meet particular program needs, in which awards shall be made based on the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposals, as evidenced by the first phase, considering among other things the proposal's commercial potential'', and lists evidence of commercial potential as the small business's commercialization record, private sector funding commitments, SBIR Phase III commitments, and the presence of other indicators of the commercial potential. The three committees do not intend that the addition of a commercialization plan either increase or decrease the emphasis an agency places on the commercialization when reviewing second-phase proposals. Rather, the commercialization plan will give SBIR agencies a means of determining the seriousness with which individual applicants approach commercialization. 
   The commercialization plan, while concise, should show that the business has thought through both the steps it must take to prepare for the fruits of the SBIR award to enter the commercial marketplace or government procurement and the steps to build business expertise as needed during the SBIR second phase time period. The three committees intend that agencies take into consideration the stage of development of the product or process in deciding whether an appropriate commercialization plan has been submitted. In those instances when at the time of the SBIR Phase II proposal, the grantee cannot identify either a product or process with the potential eventually to enter either the commercial or the government marketplace, no commercialization plan is required. 
   The compromise text also adds new provisions that were not contained in either the Senate version or the House version. Current law (Section 9(j)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act) requires that the Administrator put in place procedures to ensure, to the extent practicable, that an agency which intends to pursue research, development or production of a technology developed by a small business concern under an SBIR program enter into follow-on, non-SBIR funding agreements with the small business concern for such research, development, or production. The three committees are concerned that agencies sometimes provide these follow-on activities to large companies who are in incumbent positions or through contract bundling without written justification or without the statutorily required documentation of the impracticability of using the small business for the work. So that the SBA and the Congress can track the extent of this problem, the compromise text requires agencies to record and report each such occurrence and to describe in writing why it is impractical to provide the research project to the original SBIR company. Additionally, the compromise text directs the SBA to develop policy directives to implement the new subsection (v), Simplified Reporting Requirements. This subsection requires that the directives regarding collection of data be designed to minimize the burden on small businesses; to permit the updating the database by electronic means; and to use standardized procedures for the collection and reporting of data. 
   Section 103(a)(2) of P.L. 102-564, which reauthorized the SBIR program in 1992, added language to the description of a third phase award which made it clear that the third phase is intended to be a logical conclusion of research projects selected through competitive procedures in phases one and two. The Report of the House Committee on Small Business (H. Rept. 102-554, Pt. I) provides that the purpose of that clarification was to indicate the Committee's intent that an agency which wishes to fund an SBIR project in phase three (with non-SBIR monies) or enter into a follow-on procurement contract with an SBIR company, need not conduct another competition in order to satisfy the Federal Competition in Contracting Act (CICA). Rather, by phase three the project has survived two competitions and thus has already satisfied the requirements of CICA, set forth in section 2302(2)(E) of that Act, as they apply to the SBIR program. As there has been confusion among SBIR agencies regarding the intent of this change, the three committees reemphasize the intent initially set forth in H. Rept. 102-554, Pt. 1, including the clarification that follow-on phase three procurement contracts with an SBIR company may include procurement of products, services, research, or any combination intended for use by the Federal government. 
   Section 7. Report on Programs for Annual Performance Plan. This section requires each agency that participates in the SBIR program to submit to Congress a performance plan consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act. The House and Senate versions have the same intent. The compromise text uses the House version. 
   Section 8. Output and Outcome Data. Both the House and Senate versions contain sections enabling the collection and maintenance of information from awardees as is necessary to assess the SBIR program. Both the Senate and House versions require the SBA to maintain a public database at SBA containing information on awardees from all SBIR agencies. The Senate version adds paragraphs to the public database section dealing with database identification of businesses or subsidiaries established for the commercial application of SBIR products or services and the inclusion of information regarding mentors and mentoring networks. The House version further requires the SBA to establish and maintain a government database, which is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act and is to be used solely for program evaluation. Outside individuals must sign a non-disclosure agreement before gaining access to the database. The compromise text contains each of these provisions, with certain modifications and clarifications, which are addressed below. 
   With respect to the public database, the compromise text makes clear that proprietary information, so identified by a small business concern, will not be included in the public database. With respect to the government database, the compromise text clarifies that the inclusion of information in the government database is not to be considered publication for purposes of patent law. The compromise text further permits the SBA to include in the government database any information received in connection with an SBIR award the SBA Administrator, in conjunction with the SBIR agency program managers, consider to be relevant and appropriate or that the Federal agency considers to be useful to SBIR program evaluation.  
   With respect to small business reporting for the government database, the compromise text directs that when a small business applies for a second phase award it is required to update information in the government database. If an applicant for a second phase award receives the award, it shall update information in the database concerning the award at the termination of the award period and will be requested to voluntarily update the information annually for an additional period of five years. This reporting procedure is similar to current Department of defense requirements for the reporting of such information. When sales or additional investment information is related to more than one second phase award is involved, the compromise text permits a small business to apportion the information among the awards in any way it chooses, provided the apportionment is noted on all awards so apportioned. 
   The three committees understand that receiving complete commercialization data on the SBIR program is difficult, regardless of any reasonable time frame that could be established for the reporting of such data. Commercialization may occur many years following the receipt of a research grant and research from an award, while not directly resulting in a marketable product, may set the groundwork for additional research that leads to such a product. Nevertheless, the three committees believe that the government database will provide useful information for program evaluation. 
   Section 9. National Research Council Reports. The House version requires the four largest SBIR program agencies to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council (NRC) to conduct a comprehensive study of how the SBIR program has stimulated technological innovation and used small businesses to meet Federal research and development needs and to make recommendations on potential improvements to the program. The Senate version contains no similar provision. The study was designed to answer questions remaining from the House Committees' reviews of these programs and to make sure that a current evaluation of the program is available when the program next comes up for reauthorization. 
   The compromise text makes several changes to the House text. The compromise text adds the National Science Foundation to the agencies entering the agreement with the NRC and requires the agencies to consult with the SBA in entering such agreement. It also expands on the House version, which requires a review of the quality of SBIR research, to require a comparison of the value of projects conducted under SBIR with those funded by other Federal research and development expenditures. The compromise text further broadens the House versions' review of the economic rate of return of the SBIR program to require an evaluation of the economic benefits of the SBIR program, including economic rate of return, and a comparison of the economic benefits of the SBIR program with that of other Federal research and development expenditures. The compromise text allows the NRC to choose an appropriate time-frame for such analysis that results in a fair comparison. 
   The three committees believe that a comprehensive report on the SBIR program and its relation to other Federal research expenditures will be useful in program oversight and will provide Congress with an understanding of the effects of extramural Federal research and development funding provided to large and small businesses and universities. The three committees understand, however, that measuring the direct benefits to the nation's economy from the SBIR program and other Federal research expenditures may be difficult to calculate and may not provide a complete portrayal of the benefits achieved by the SBIR program. Accordingly, the legislation requires the NRC also to review the non-economic benefits of the SBIR program, which may include, among other matters, the increase in scientific knowledge that has resulted from the program. The paragraph in the compromise text calling for recommendations remains the same as the House version, except that the bill now asks the NRC to make recommendations, should there be any. 
   While the study is to be carried out within National Research Council study guidelines and procedures, the compromise text requires the NRC to take the steps necessary to ensure that individuals from the small business community with expertise in the SBIR program are well represented in the panel established for performing the study and among the peer reviewers of the study. The NRC is to consult with the consider the views of the SBA's Office of Technology and the SBA's Office of Advocacy and to conduct the study in an open manner that makes sure that the views and experiences of small business involved in the program are carefully considered in the design and execution of the study. Extension of the SBIR program for eight years rather than the five being contemplated when the House study provision was initially written has necessitated some adjustments in the study. The report is now required three years rather than four years after the date of enactment of the Act and the NRC is to update the report within six years of enactment. The update is intended to bring current, any information from the study relevant to the reauthorization of the SBIR program. It is not intended to be a second full-fledged study. In addition, semiannual progress reports by NRC to the three committees are required. 
   Section 10. Federal Agency Expenditures for the SBIR Program. The Senate version requires each Federal agency with an SBIR program to provide the SBA with report describing its methodology for calculating its extramural budget for purposes of SBIR program set-aside and requires the Administrator of the SBA to include an analysis of the methodology from each agency in its annual report to the Congress. The House version has no similar provision. The compromise text follows the Senate text except that it specifies that each agency, rather than the agency's comptroller, shall submit the agency's report to the Administrator. The three committees intend that each agency's methodology include an itemization of each research program that is excluded from the calculation of its extramural budget for SBIR purposes as well as a brief explanation of why the agency feels each excluded program meets a particular exemption. 
   Section 11. Federal and State Technology Partnership Program. This section establishes the FAST program from the Senate version, which is a competitive matching grant program to encourage states to assist in the development of high-technology businesses. The House version does not contain a similar provision. The most significant changes from the Senate version in the compromise text are an extension of the maximum duration of awards from three years to five and the lowering of the matching requirement for funds assisting businesses in low income areas to 50 cents per federal dollar, as advocated by Ranking Member Velazquez of the House Small Business Committee. The compromise text combines the definitions found in the Senate version of this section and the mentoring networks section. 
   Section 12. Mentoring Networks. The Senate version sets forth criteria for mentoring networks that organizations are encouraged to establish with matching funds from the FAST program and creates a database of small businesses willing to act as mentors. The compromise text, except for relocating the program definitions to Section 11, is the same as the Senate text. The House version did not contain a similar provision. 
   Section 13. Simplified Reporting Requirements. This section is not in either the House or the Senate versions. It requires the SBA Administrator to work with SBIR program agencies on standardizing SBIR reporting requirements with the ultimate goal of making the SBA's SBIR database more user friendly. This provision requires the SBA to consider the needs of each agency when establishing and maintaining the database. Additionally, it requires the SBA to take measures to reduce the administrative burden on SBIR program participants whenever possible including, for example, permitting updating by electronic means. 
   Section 14. Rural Outreach Program Extension. This provision, which was not in either the House or the Senate versions, extends the life and authorization for appropriations for the Rural Outreach Program of the Small Business Administration for four additional years through fiscal year 2005. It is the intent of the three committees that this program be evaluated on the same schedule and in the same manner as the FAST program. Among other things, the evaluation should examine the extent to which the programs complement or duplicate each other. The evaluation should also include recommendations for improvements to the program, if any.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill before us reauthorizes and improves upon one of the most successful small business programs we have in the Federal government--the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The Small Business Committee has spent close to nine months deliberating and negotiating this important bill. My colleagues on the Committee, and in particular, Senators KERRY, BURNS, LEVIN, SNOWE and ENZI, have all been very cooperative and provided valuable assistance in preparing this important piece of legislation. The product that has resulted from the Committee's consideration is a bi-partisan bill that should provide small businesses with confidence in the Congress' strong support for this program. 
   Mr. President, this Managers' Amendment is the result of negotiations conducted among my Committee and the Small Business and Science Committees of the House of Representatives. The SBIR reauthorization bill that originally passed the House contained certain provisions that were not included in the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business. These provisions had been interpreted by many in the small business community to place requirements on small businesses receiving Federal research and development funds that are not placed on other businesses or on universities that are also recipients of such dollars. My Committee negotiated with the representatives of the House Science Committee, which drafted these provisions, to come up with language that would provide information to Congress that is necessary for its oversight of this program, while ensuring that small businesses are not subject to government mandates that would affect their ability to perform high-quality research and development for the Federal government. The House Science Committee has been very cooperative to ensure that their provisions did not cause these unintended consequences. 
   This bill, with the Managers' amendment will ensure that this program, which has been proven successful over a long period of time, can continue to be so. Seventeen years ago, President Reagan signed into law the Small Business Innovation Development Act, which required Federal agencies with extramural research and development  budgets of $100 million or more to set aside not less than 2/10th of one percent of that amount for the first SBIR program. In 1992, the program was reauthorized and Congress dictated that the program grow to 2.5 percent of the extramural research and development budgets. Thousands of small firms have received research grants under the programs since 1982, and more than $1 billion was awarded to small businesses in Fiscal Year 1998 alone. 
   The original drafters of the SBIR program acknowledged that small businesses are the primary source of our nation's innovations. Accordingly, the SBIR program was created to stimulate technological development by leveraging the capabilities of these small firms. The goals of the program are threefold. First, the program assists the government with its research and development needs. Second, the program provides a catalyst to groundbreaking research and development. Third, the program strengthens our economy by promoting the commercialization of technologies developed through Federal research. The commercialization of these technologies by small firms increases the competitiveness of our country in the world economy and expands employment opportunities. 
   A good example of the benefits that the SBIR program provides to small businesses is the experience of Cutting Edge Optronics, a 49 employee firm in St. Charles, Missouri. Cutting Edge Optronics has received several phase one and phase two SBIR awards with NASA and the Air Force to develop high-output lasers with both military and commercial applications. 
   The SBIR program has made the difference between Cutting Edge Optronics growing its business and merely staying in business. The SBIR program has allowed Cutting Edge to engage in state-of-the-art research in a very competitive climate, which it otherwise would not have been able to do. Moreover, if the Air Force research develops successfully, Cutting Edge Optronics expects that the commercial applications of the technology will spur astronomical growth of the company. 
   Mr. President, small businesses are the greatest job creators in our economy. During the last seven years of economic growth, small businesses have accounted for the vast majority of all the net new jobs created. It is only rational that the Federal government distribute its research funds in a way that will contribute to this job growth by creating incentives to the private sector to market the 
   technologies developed. As the example of Cutting Edge Optronics demonstrates, the SBIR program does just that. 
   There is abundant evidence that the SBIR program has been a success both in assisting the government with its research and development needs and in turning that research into new products and services. Numerous studies have been conducted over the last several years that bear this out. A 1989 General Accounting Office (GAO) study reported that scientists and engineers at Federal agencies indicated that the overall quality of the research performed under SBIR awards equaled, and in some cases, exceeded the quality of other agency research they monitored. As the program has grown in recent years, it does not appear this conclusion has changed. A 1995 GAO study concluded that the quality of SBIR research proposals has kept pace with the program's expansion. 
   Morever, the small businesses that have received SBIR awards, have had significant success in commercializing technology. This is especially important considering that these firms are engaging in cutting-edge research that will not always have a commercial application. A 1997 internal Department of Defense study found that the average phase-two SBIR award of $400,000 generated $760,000 in sales and attracted approximately $600,000 in additional non-SBIR funding. Additionally, the GAO has reported that the commercialization rate on SBIR projects is close to 40 percent. There is no question that this program's record of success easily justifies a long reauthorization. 
   While there is general agreement that the SBIR program is successful, there have also been some concerns that this legislation is intended to resolve. First, the GAO released a report in June 1998, indicating that different agencies are using different interpretations of the term ``extramural budget.'' The use of different interpretations may lead to inaccurate calculations of the amount of funds that should be allocated to each agency's SBIR program. To remedy this situation, the bill requires each SBIR program agency to provide the Small Business Administration (SBA) and Congress with a description of its methodology for calculating the amount of the extramural budget for that agency. It is our hope that by closely analyzing how the agencies are calculating their extramural budgets, we can be assured that each agency will adopt a uniform definition of extramural budget that is consistent with the statutory language and Congress' intent. 
   Second, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, has received from the GAO disturbing information regarding the SBA's collection and maintenance of data on the SBIR program. Specifically, my Committee learned that the GAO, in preparing its two most recent reports on the SBIR program, spent substantial resources correcting and updating information in the SBA's SBIR database. When the Federal government is providing funds to third parties, whether in the private sector or to a state or local government entity, the most basic rule of program oversight is to monitor who has received those funds and what they have done with the funds. Accordingly, this legislation establishes a statutory duty on the SBIR program agencies to provide the SBA with data on each SBIR award winner in a timely manner. Moreover, it requires the SBA to maintain a comprehensive and public database of the small firms that receive SBIR awards and the activities supported by SBIR funds. 
   Finally, the GAO recently issued a report raising questions about the geographic concentration of SBIR awards. From fiscal year 1993 through 1996, companies in one-third of the states received 85 percent of the SBIR awards. Companies on the east and west coast received a vast majority of these awards, while companies in the South, Midwest and Rocky Mountain states generally received very few awards. For example, the GAO reported that in fiscal year 1997, companies in Massachusetts and California received 202 and 326 phase-two awards, respectively, out of approximately 1,400 awards nationally. Thus, they received almost 38 percent of the awards. 
   Mr. President, if the SBIR program is going to continue to be successful, it is incumbent on us to do more to reach out and provide opportunities to firms in the South, the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain states that can provide high-quality research and development and provide them with the information and assistance they need so that they may seize the opportunity to participate in the SBIR program. The SBIR program was never intended to serve a limited group of small businesses, and we must do all we can to increase the participation of as many small businesses as possible. 
   Therefore, this legislation establishes a comprehensive program to assist states in the development of high-technology businesses that could participate in the SBIR program. Specifically, the bill creates a matching-grant program for organizations at the state or local level attempting to enhance or develop technology research and development by small business concerns. This legislation acknowledges that states that do not aggressively support the development of high-technology firms are at a competitive disadvantage in establishing a business climate conducive to technology development. More importantly, however, building stronger support for high-technology firms will expand economic opportunities for our country generally and will increase our competitiveness in the world market. 
   The Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000 is a necessary step to ensure that the Federal Government continues to utilize the vast capabilities of high-technology small businesses to meet its research and development goals. Moreover, it ensures that these research funds are leveraged to strengthen our Nation's economy and its position as the lead innovator in the world. 
   The bill in front of us, with the Managers' amendment, is a reasonable  compromise that will provide an effective structure for this program for the next eight years. Given the hard work that has gone into this compromise legislation, I trust that the House will act quickly on this bill, so that small businesses involved in the SBIR program will have confidence that the program will continue without interruption.

   Additionally, it places children at risk by prohibiting EPA-approved products that protect our children from diseases such as asthma, encephalitis, malaria, Lyme disease, brown recluse spiders, and others. 
   EPA does not support this amendment, and the amendment is based on the shockingly false premise that EPA does not care enough about children to protect them as mandated by law.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senators LINCOLN, KERREY of Nebraska, and ROBERTS, prevents funds from being used for the application of any pesticide that is not approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency in any area managed by the U.S. Park Service that may be used by children. Further, it directs the Secretary of the Interior to coordinate with EPA to ensure that pest control methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure of children to pesticides. 
   Let there be no mistake that every member of this Senate supports the protection of children. It is the mandate of the EPA to do so. They are already required by law to do so. 
   The strict standard that mandates EPA on product approval is: ``reasonable certainty of no harm.'' That is a tall hurdle. 
   The shocking thing about this underlying amendment by the Senator from California is that its premise holds that the EPA, is not, I repeat, not, doing its job protecting children. Let me repeat, this is a referendum on whether EPA is protecting children. Now, I think, that if the EPA were paying attention, it would be news to the EPA Administrator that her agency is not protecting children. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD, I have listened to countless hours of testimony about the Administrator's devotion to protecting children. I would think, that if we had a Sense of the Senate that Administrator Browner is not doing her job protecting children, we would defeat that. 
   I asked the nominee (James V. Aidala) to be Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances of the Environmental Protection Agency if the EPA already protects children on military bases from harmful pesticides and we got the following response:  
   The protection of children is one of our highest priorities. When we register, re-register, or reassess tolerances for existing pesticides we try to ensure that our actions are protective of all consumers, especially children.  
   He continued on to say that,  
   FQPA requires special protections for infants and children including: an explicit determination that tolerances are safe for children; an additional safety factor, if necessary, to account for uncertainty in data relative to children; and consideration of children's special sensitivity and exposure to pesticide chemicals.  
   Let the record also show that the reason that many pesticides are used is to protect children from bacteria and disease including asthma, encephalitis, malaria, lyme disease, Legionnaires' disease, and other diseases all of which that occur here in the U.S. 
   Mr. President, what is a pesticide? According to EPA,  
   ..... all of these common products are considered pesticides. Cockroach sprays and baits; insect repellents for personal use; rat and other rodent poisons; flea and tick sprays, powders, and pet collars; kitchen, laundry, and bath disinfectants and sanitizer; products that kill mold and mildew; some lawn and garden products, such as week killers; and, some swimming pool chemicals.  
   Pesticides eradicate a wide variety of pests, including cockroaches, biting insects, algae, bacteria, poisonous Brown Recluse Spiders--as found in the U.S. Capitol buildings--and infectious microbes which result in unsanitary and unhealthy conditions at food and medical care facilities. 
   Many common cleaners, disinfectants and sanitizer are used to eradicate infectious microbes, bacteria, and algae in bathroom and kitchens and nursing homes, hospitals and other health care facilities. Cooling systems and water supplies are treated. Chlorine, which is registered as a pesticide by EPA could be affected by the underlying amendment. Products that sterilize medical equipment are carcinogenic and would thus also be affected. 
   Used according to EPA--label instructions, pesticides not only prevent property damage from termites, but also protect our children. West Nile virus and encephalitis, which have been detected throughout the mid-Atlantic, are carried by mosquitoes. Deer ticks carry lyme disease, and cockroaches have been linked to the worsening of asthma symptoms. 
   According to the New York Times, asthma is now the most common cause of hospitalization among American children affecting a total of five million. Deaths among children with the condition rose 78 percent from 1980 to 1993. 
   Again, these pesticides are approved by the EPA following a rigorous and science-based process to determine what is safe and what is not safe. With our concern for the safety of our children in mind, this body passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) unanimously in 1996. FQPA was designed to update the safety standards of pesticides especially with respect to children and other vulnerable sub-populations. The Environmental Protection Agency has been implementing this law for the past four years. In the regulatory review process EPA reviews data from up to 120 tests conducted on pesticides prior to registration. 
   When registration decisions are made, the EPA includes additional safety factors for children. According to EPA, ``..... these specific requirements in the statute will help EPA in its efforts to implement the NAS report and ensure that risks to infants and children are always considered. .....'' And, under FIFRA, EPA has the authority to immediately cancel the use of any pest control product that it believes poses an imminent risk to public health. 
   Obviously, EPA has the authority to protect children. Obviously, EPA believes that the law protects children. Obviously, EPA believes they are protecting children. 
   Since the new law in 1996, EPA has re-reviewed thousands of products. We are spending about $50 million in taxpayer money to pay full-time experts at the EPA to Administer the FQPA and to re-review the products. They tell us what is safe and what is not safe. 
   Contrary to what was mistakenly represented in previous debate, EPA does NOT support this amendment. According to EPA in answers in response to questions I submitted for the RECORD on June 30, 2000, ``..... the amendment has not been subject to a full review by the Administration, nor has the Administration taken a position on the amendment.'' 
   With this extensive regulatory process in place and recently updated, I cannot support the Senator's proposal to regulate further pesticides by completely ignoring and circumventing 
   EPA's aggressive implementation of FQPA, as well as the Clinton Administration's entire regulatory process. The Senator from California's proposal will effectively regulate pesticides from the Senate floor on an appropriations bill, which is not only bad science, but bad public policy as well, and a process we all should want to avoid. I think if we are going to have a referendum on whether the EPA protect's children, we should have some cursory review of the subject first. 
   I am also not an expert on asthma or encephalitis or lyme's disease or salmonella, or e. Coli or Legionnaires' disease or the West Nile virus. 
   If the Senator from California has some information that says that the EPA is not doing their job, then I think the information should be reviewed and the EPA should have the opportunity to respond and comment and defend itself. If there is an emergency that the Senator from California is aware of, EPA has the regulatory authority to deal with it and they should. If EPA is not appropriately dealing with an emergency, perhaps we should ask the Administrator to tell us why that is  the case. Absent that, it is not a very good idea for us to be substituting our scientific judgment for the judgment of Administrator Browner's scientists as to what is and is not safe. 
   We also know that according to industry and EPA, there is no legal or regulatory or industry ``term of art'' for a ``category I or category II acute nerve toxin.'' If we are going to tell EPA to prohibit something, EPA should understand what we want them to prohibit. If we are going to tell industry that they cannot use a product, they should know what product they are forbidden to use. 
   One organophosphate, for example, is Raid. Organochlorides, I am told, are products that contain carbon and chlorine which wipes out all hard surface disinfectants. One such hard surface disinfectant which is used daily to clean our bathrooms is Lysol disinfectant. Some of the same products are used to clean our cafeteria. Some carcinogens are used to sterilize medical equipment. 
   The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations has just received a bipartisan letter from the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House committee of jurisdiction stating that this is an issue under their jurisdiction which should be dealt with solely through the authorization process. The bipartisan letter was signed by Congressmen COMBEST, STENHOLM, GOODLATTE and CLAYTON. 
   Mr. President, I am continuously amazed at the knowledge and dedication of my Senate colleagues but I will admit that I am not an expert on organophosphates or nerve toxins. I fear that this issue about nerve toxins and organophosphates and ``probable carcinogens'' may be a mystery to a good number of my colleagues and it is a horrible precedent for regulation, which will impact not only the urban uses of pest control products, but also the agricultural uses for our Nation's farmers. 
   We know that the EPA does not support this amendment. It has not reviewed it and I don't expect them to review it during an election year. 
   My amendment protects children by allowing Carol Browner and her cops on the beat to do their job. 
   We have a dreadful picture of a bite from a Brown recluse spider. This spider is bad news as the picture indicates. This poisonous spider was found in the Capitol on more than one occasion and it is called a recluse spider because it is hard to discover. In the last three weeks, a Senate appropriations staffer was bitten by this spider. 
   Used according to EPA-label instructions, pesticides protect our children by controlling harmful pests like disease carrying insects, infectious bacteria, poison ivy, and other noxious weeds. 
   This underlying Boxer amendment would prohibit the use of products that have been scientifically tested and approved for use by the EPA to help prevent disease and improve the quality of life for all Americans, especially children. The EPA has a sound regulatory process in place that protects children and provides safe, effective pest control tools for use in the farmer's field, the cafeteria, hospitals, playgrounds, and the home. To undermine the process of the strictest pesticide regulations in the world would not only set a misguided precedent, but would indeed threaten the health of our children. It would also send a shocking message that our EPA is not following its legal mandate and its perpetually-articulated mission of protecting children. 
   In summary, the underlying amendment it is unnecessary, it is overly-broad, it is a horrible precedent and it is encumbered with far-reaching unintended negative consequences that are harmful to children. 
   I just do not believe the U.S. Senate should take an action which makes the visitor's centers of our national parks the largest cockroach hotels on the planet. 
   My amendment prohibits the use of any pesticide not approved by Administrator Browner's team and ensures consultation to ensure that pest control methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure of children to pesticides. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and preserve the effectiveness and the integrity of the science-based regulatory system. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from the Farm Bureau opposing the underlying amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is not fair that a self-employed person cannot deduct 100 percent of health care costs when a large business can. A self-employed person is denied that deductibility, even though we have worked since 1995 when this body accepted my amendment at that time to increase the deductibility of insurance costs for the self-employed. Still, only 60 percent of the health insurance cost is deductible by the self-employed. 
   I have talked to a lot of these people. They cannot wait until 2003 when they will get 100-percent deductibility. My amendment says there is 100-percent deductibility this year and makes sure that the 5 million Americans in households headed by self-employed can get health care coverage, including 1.3 million children. 
   It also corrects a disparity in current law which says if a self-employed person is eligible for health coverage from another plan, a second job, or a spouse's plan, they cannot deduct. This says you can deduct so long as you do not participate in another health care plan. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides and my colleague from Illinois. 
   I urge this body to accept the amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Michigan on his attempt to address the issue of high gas prices. However, I must oppose his amendment. 
   The problem with the high gas prices we are experiencing is not the result of the gas taxes, but with the fact that the Clinton/Gore Administration has pursued a long-term consistent energy policy discouraging domestic production of oil, coal, nuclear, gas, hydropower, etc. The result of this cartel  policy has been to put us over a barrel--an OPEC barrel of oil with resulting high gas prices. 
   My colleagues offering this amendment have stated that this amendment would hold the trust fund harmless. Once again, I applaud their desire to help the consumers, but violating the ``trust'' in the highway trust fund is not holding the trust fund harmless. 
   We cannot risk the tremendous gains we made to ensure that the gas tax was a dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose. This is a true user fee. This is a user fee that works. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Abraham amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. While this legislation has long been one of my priorities as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, it is of critical concern to a sector of the United States economy that employs more than 27.5 million people, generates over $3.6 million in sales, and has grown by 103 percent in the past four years. That sector is women-owned businesses. 
   As one of the fastest growing segments of the economy, women-owned small businesses are essential to America's future prosperity. In recognition of this growth and their contribution to our economic life, I led a bipartisan group of policy makers last month to convene the National Women's Small Business Summit, New Leaders for a New Century, in Kansas City, Missouri. With the support of Senators KERRY, FEINSTEIN, HUTCHISON, SNOWE, and LANDRIEU, we set out, through this summit, to listen to women-owned small-business owners. Our goal was to elicit their views, concerns, and policy recommendations on the obstacles that women entrepreneurs face every day as they strive to run successful businesses. 
   One issue that we heard loud and clear was that the ``death tax'' has to go. In fact, repeal of the estate tax was the number one tax priority identified by the summit participants. So it is particularly timely that the Senate is considering this crucial legislation that will eliminate a tax that discourages hard work and innovation rather than encouraging and rewarding it. 
   Mr. President, I believe we can now agree on both sides of the aisle that the estate tax is highly detrimental to small and family-owned businesses and farms in this country. Indeed, according to recent findings, the estates of self-employed Americans are four times more likely to be subject to the estate tax than Americans who work for someone else. In addition, because owners of small businesses do not know when they will owe the estate tax or, consequently, how much they will owe, the tax exacts excessively high compliance costs.  
   For example a June 1999 survey by the Center for the Study of Taxation found that eight of ten family-owned business reported taking steps, such as estate planning, to minimize the effect of this tax. Moreover, the Upstate New York survey revealed that the average spending on estate planning was almost $125,000 per business. Similarly, a survey by the National Association of Women Business owners found that the estate tax imposed almost $60,000 in estate-tax-related costs on women business owners. 
   These costs translate into thousands of dollars of valuable capital that women-owned businesses are pouring down the drain simply to ensure that the estate tax does not become the grim reaper for their businesses. And if anyone thinks that wasting these funds is not important, they should note carefully that access to capital was the second most pressing issue area identified at the National Women's Small Business Summit. 
   Mr. President, compliance costs pertaining to the death tax also directly affect the availability of jobs. In the Upstate New York survey, an estimated 14 jobs per business have been lost because of the cost of Federal estate-tax planning to those same businesses. A study by Douglas Holtz-Eakin found that the estate tax caused an annual 3 percent reduction in desired hiring by sole proprietors. A 1995 Gallup poll also found that three out of five businesses would add more jobs over the coming year if the estate tax were eliminated. 
   If nothing else, this legislation boils down to one simple issue--jobs! Small businesses are the top job creator in this country, and the death tax is sending those jobs to the grave. Existing businesses are not hiring as many workers because of estate-planning costs, and when the owner dies, this tax can cause the business to be liquidated just to pay the government. And when those doors close, they close hard and fast on the jobs that the business provided in our local communities. That is a reality we simply cannot ignore or allow to be concealed by erroneous claims that repealing the death tax is just a tax cut for ``the rich.'' 
   Mr. President, the cost of the estate tax is high not only for small business owners, but for those seeking employment and for the overall economy. It is time that those costs are eliminated by repealing the estate tax once and for all. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed and the underlying legislation for the continued success of America's women-owned businesses and the jobs they create.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on a number of occasions, I have come to this floor to talk about the importance of women-owned businesses. Women-owned businesses employ more than 27.5 million people and generate over $3.6 billion in sales and have grown by 103 percent in the past 4 years. 
   As one of the fastest growing segments of the economy, women-owned small businesses are essential to America's future prosperity, as well as the prosperity and the well-being of the individual communities and particularly the families of those women who own businesses. 
   In recognition of this growth and contribution to our economic life, I convened with a bipartisan group of policymakers a national women's small business summit entitled ``New Leaders for a New Century,'' which was held in Kansas City, MO, on June 4 and 5 of this year. The cosponsors of that conference were my ranking member on the Small Business Committee, Senator JOHN KERRY, along with Senators DIANNE FEINSTEIN, KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, OLYMPIA SNOWE, and MARY LANDRIEU.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from South Dakota for bringing attention to this serious problem. Fetal alcohol syndrome affects 2,000 infants born every year. At the same time, we must keep in mind that birth defects generally are a major, even larger health care problem in this country. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, and about 150,000 children will be born with a major birth defect annually. 
   This year, CDC is spending only $16.5 million total on all birth defects, with an additional $2 million being spent on a folic acid awareness campaign for which I fought and worked with my colleagues in this body to support. The $10 million for CDC to fight fetal alcohol syndrome would be well spent. At the same time, we need to significantly increase our overall investment in the fight against birth defects. 
   I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member and Senator DASCHLE as we move forward to make sure this critical area of children's health is adequately addressed in this bill and in the work of the CDC in the coming year. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer what I think is a very important amendment to increase the funding this bill provides for a vital piece of our Nation's health care system--our community health centers. 
   This amendment, which I am very pleased to offer in conjunction with my colleague, Senator HOLLINGS of South Carolina, who has been a long-time supporter of community health centers--as was the late Senator from Rhode Island, the father of the distinguished occupant of the chair, who was a great champion of community health centers--along with a total of 58 cosponsors, would increase funding for community health centers by a total of $50 million for this coming year. That is a $50 million increase over that which is already included. The offset we use to fund this health center increase is a reduction in the departmental management fund for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
   The managers of this bill, Senators SPECTER and HARKIN, clearly had a very difficult task in crafting this bill. There is a lot of money in it, but there are even more demands and requests for good things that this bill does. And they have to compete for the funds that, although they are significant, are still limited. 
   Despite the competing demands, the underlying bill has a $100 million increase for community health centers. I sincerely commend the chairman and the ranking member for their efforts to include this very needed increase in the funding for the CHCs. At the same time, I believe very strongly that adding an additional $50 million for health center funding is crucial to ensure that these vital health care providers have sufficient resources behind them to do everything they can to provide for the uninsured and medically underserved Americans. 
   All of us who have talked about health care know that the lack of access to care is perhaps the largest single health care problem that faces our Nation today. 
   Part of this problem is a lack of health insurance. About 44 million Americans are not covered by any type of health plan. But an equally serious part of the problem is that many people are simply unable to get access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a young couple with a sick child is out of luck if they can't get in to see a pediatrician or other health care provider. In too many urban and rural communities around  the country, there just are not enough doctors to go around. 
   I urge my colleagues, if they have not done what I have done--and that is, to visit community health centers in their States--that they do so. You will be amazed and you will be very uplifted to see the work that is going on each and every day in these community health centers. 
   Community health centers in a center city, in the poorest neighborhoods, are reaching out and helping everyone--from the very young to the teenage mother perhaps with a child, or a teenager who is expecting a child, to the very elderly, who have difficulty getting around. 
   We see the same thing in rural areas, in some of the communities that are the hardest to access in our State. There are community health centers with dedicated physicians and nurses and health care professionals who are there to answer the health care needs of people who would have no chance of getting service were it not for the health centers. 
   These community health centers are truly the safety net of our health care system. For all of my colleagues, I trust they do know about these centers, but for other concerned citizens who may be watching, I suggest they find out about the community health centers in their area. What are they doing; are they serving people in need? I can tell my colleagues, based on the experience in my State, they are delivering the service to people who otherwise would not be served, were it not for these CHCs. 
   We all know there are problems with access to health care. There are many good ideas on additional steps we need to take. Some people want nationalized health care. Other people want new tax credits, subsidized health insurance. Others want to expand governmental health programs. Some people want to enhance insurance pooling arrangements. All of these have been proposed in an effort to make sure people have the health coverage and can get the care they need. As different and as diverse and as creative as many of these ideas are, they all have one thing in common: They are not going to be passed into law this year. All these wonderful ideas are going to come together. They are going to clash. We will look at them and talk about them, and we are going to refine them and argue about them and go down different roads. They are not going to pass this year. The breadth of the disagreement over these policy issues and the political complications of an election year make it totally unlikely that Congress will bring any of these new ideas to reality. 
   There is one thing we can still do this year, something we can pass into law that will make a big difference for many people who lack access to health care. What we can do is dramatically increase funding for community health centers and help them reach out to even more uninsured and underserved Americans. 
   Just for the technical background, health centers are private not-for-profit clinics that provide primary care, preventive health care services in thousands of medically underserved urban and rural communities around the country. Partially with the help of Federal grants, health care centers provide basic care for about 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured. Health centers provide care for 7 million people who are minorities, 600,000 farm workers, close to 1 out of every 20 Americans, 1 out of every 12 rural residents, 1 out of every 6 low-income children, and 1 out of every 5 babies born to low-income families. 
   Despite this great work, there are millions of Americans who still cannot get access to health care. The demand for the type of care these centers provide simply exceeds the resources available. Today we can help change this. There are as many as 44 million who are not covered by a health plan. We are covering about 11 million. We need to do something to make sure we serve those additional people. We are building on a program that has proven itself to be effective. 
   This is probably the best health care bargain we can get because these not-for-profit centers leverage the Federal dollars that go into them. They collect insurance from those who are insured. They can collect Medicare or Medicaid. They are a vehicle for providing the service. The average cost per patient served by a community health center in my State is something like $350 a year. That is how much it costs them because of the other reimbursements and because of the 
   efficiencies and economies of scale. That is less than $1 a day. Not too many plans can provide so much bang for the buck, so much important delivery of health care service. This is probably the first priority of all the health care problems we are facing, and there are many. We can do something that will have a real impact on access to care and the uninsured. It is the best thing we can do to expand that safety net and pursue the search for better health care. 
   There are a couple of key reasons why community health centers are so important. No. 1, these dollars build on an existing program that produces results. Unlike many other health care proposals that suggest radically new and untested ideas, health centers are known entities. They do an outstanding job. They are known, respected, and trusted in their communities. 
   Numerous independent studies, in addition to the observations of those of us who have traveled around to visit them, confirm that community health centers provide high quality care in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Health centers truly target the health care access problem. By definition, health centers must be located in medically underserved communities, which means places where people have serious problems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the problem right at its source--in the communities where those people live. Health centers are relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary and preventive care for one person for less than $1 a day, $350 a year. That has to be one of the best health care bargains around. 
   This proposal is not a Government takeover of health care. Admittedly, this amendment calls for more Government spending, but unlike most other health care proposals, this funding would not go to create or expand a huge health care bureaucracy. This amendment would invest additional funds into private organizations which have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, high quality, cost-effective health care providers. 
   If this amendment succeeds, it will mean an overall increase in health center funding of $150 million. That level of increase will put us on a path to double health center funding over 5 years. As my colleagues know, this same goal, doubling funding over 5 years, is what we challenge ourselves to provide to the National Institutes of Health. Through these increased funds to health centers, we continue our support for the good work that goes on in health centers. As in NIH, we have increased funding for biomedical research that produces medical innovations and develops ways to save, improve, and prolong people's lives. I have supported those efforts. In fact, the underlying bill contains funding increases for NIH that will keep us on the track for doubling NIH funding over 5 years for this, the third straight year. 
   But as we expand the envelope for what is possible in the world of health care, we must also ensure that more Americans have access to the most basic level of primary care services, including regular checkups, immunizations, and prenatal care. If we are not reaching some Americans, it doesn't matter how much we put into health care research. It doesn't matter how many innovations we come up with. It doesn't matter how many new drugs or new procedures or new techniques we develop. If they don't have access to the basic health care system, it is not going to help them at all. 
   That is why I believe it is so important to set the same noble goal we have set for research, doubling funding over 5 years, and adopt it for community health centers as well. There is widespread bipartisan support for both this 5-year plan as well as for the first-year installment. Nineteen of my Senate colleagues cosponsored what I called the REACH initiative--a resolution calling on Congress to double health center funding over 5 years. 
   This resolution has since been made part of the congressional budget resolution that establishes our tax and  spending goals and priorities. Sixty-seven Senators joined in my initial request for the 1-year funding increase of $150 million. This amendment, which makes this 1-year increase a reality, has 57 cosponsors. 
   I am pleased to say that Gov. George W. Bush has publicly announced his support for funding increases for community health centers comparable to what this amendment would provide. 
   I thank my colleagues who have joined in these efforts for their support. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to support this amendment. A dramatic increase in community health center funding is one of the first and most important things Congress can do this year to truly help the uninsured and medically underserved Americans. Let us not waste the opportunity to make it happen. 
   I express my thanks to the chairman and ranking member of the committee.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to support in the strongest possible way the Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill relating to ergonomics. This amendment will save businesses, small businesses particularly, and other employers, and primarily their employees, from the ravages of OSHA's regulatory impulses running rampant. 
   As many in this body know, I have questioned OSHA's approach to formulating an ergonomics regulation for several years. Last year, I introduced a bill, which currently has 48 cosponsors, to force OSHA to wait for the results of the study that we and the President--and the President--directed the National Academy of Sciences to conduct on whether there is sufficient scientific evidence to support this regulation. 
   This measure is known as the Sensible Ergonomics Scientific Evidence Act, or the SENSE Act. Sadly, this issue, as administered by OSHA, has been lacking in common sense in the years that OSHA has been working on it. 
   We were not able to move the SENSE Act last year, nor were we able to convince OSHA they needed to put some common sense into their regulatory process before going forward with the proposed rule. At this time last year, we were fearful of what OSHA might come up with because it did not look as if they were going about it in a reasonable, responsible way. When the proposed rule was finally published in November and we found out what they wanted to do, it was worse than we could have imagined. 
   It is tragic that OSHA and this administration have all but disregarded the protections for the rulemaking process that are needed for sound regulations. They moved at an unprecedented pace, and it looked as if they were trying to get this regulation finalized before they even left office. 
   This is a classic example of ready, fire, aim. OSHA needs to be told they have gone too far and they must suspend the regulation so that it can be redrafted and put into some reasonable, workable approach. 
   The Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill must be adopted, and I urge my colleagues to strongly support it. 
   I have the honor of serving as chairman of the Small Business Committee, and I have heard from literally thousands of small businesses and their representatives about the utter terror they face of having to comply with an impossible regulation that they cannot figure out and they cannot implement. 
   Let me be clear, their fear is not that they will have to protect their employees or even that they will have to spend some money to achieve that goal--they are doing that already because they do not want to see their employees have repetitive motion injuries or ergonomic injuries. They want to do what is right for their employees. In many cases, these employees in the smallest businesses are like family. They treat them like family members because they work closely with them. 
   Instead, this fear, this terror is that they will be forced to figure out what this regulation means, what is expected of them, whether they can satisfy the requirements, whether they will get any results from the huge costs of this regulation, and whether they can convince an OSHA inspector they have satisfied a regulation which gives no clear guidelines. 
   In some cases, the alternative to complying with the regulation may be to close the company or to move it to another 
   country where they do not have such regulations, or, which is also extremely sad, they may be required to get rid of employees and buy equipment and replace their employees with equipment.  
   None of these regulatory efforts has to do with assuring protection for employees from repetitive motion injuries. The simple truth is, there is nothing the regulation says that will protect employees. It does not do what OSHA would have us believe it does. It does not tell employers how they can help their employees. On this basis alone, the proposed regulation fails and must be withdrawn. 
   OSHA likes to say this regulation is flexible. So is a bullwhip. What OSHA calls flexible is really a level of vagueness such that no employer, no matter how well intentioned, would be able to tell what is required of them or if they have done enough. Let me give a couple examples to help illustrate the degree of vagueness that permeates this proposal. These terms come directly from the language of the proposed rule: 
   Throughout the standard, employers are directed to implement provisions and establish program elements ``promptly.'' 
   In analyzing a ``problem job,'' employers are instructed to look for employees ``exerting considerable physical effort to complete a motion,'' or employees ``doing the same motion over and over again.'' 
   Engineering controls are to be used ``where feasible.'' When implementing the ``incremental abatement'' provisions, employers are to ``implement controls that reduce MSD hazards to the extent feasible.'' 
   For an employer to evaluate its ergonomics program, it is to ``evaluate the elements of [its] program to ensure they are functioning properly; and evaluate the program to ensure it is eliminating or materially reducing MSD hazards.'' 
   Ergonomics risk factors are defined as: ``(i) force (i.e., forceful exertions, including dynamic motions); (ii) repetition; (iii) awkward postures; (iv) static postures; (v) contact stress; (vi) vibration; and (vii) cold temperatures.'' 
   Anytime one lifts a garbage can outside in the winter, one probably goes through all those. 
   To be effective, however, this regulation must tell employers when their employees will be injured, when an employee will have lifted too much, 
   when the employee will have done too many repetitions, what an employer can do to prevent injuries or to help an employee recover from an injury. 
   OSHA loves to say this proposal is supported by adequate science and many studies. Unfortunately, none of these studies have answered these critical questions, or at least OSHA has not bothered to include any of that information in this proposed rule. 
   All other OSHA regulations provide a threshold of exposure to a risk beyond which the employer must not let the employee be exposed without protection or taking a corrective measure. 
   This proposal is unique in its complete absence of any thresholds. I guess that is what they mean by ``flexible.'' That bullwhip they use can come down at any time and give them the full benefits of flexibility. There is not a single threshold. 
   OSHA is telling employers: We think you have a problem. We cannot define it. We cannot tell you how to fix it. But you have to go fix it. We will hold you accountable for how well you fix it, even though we cannot tell you how to fix it. 
   This is absurd. It would be like driving down a highway where the sign said, ``Don't drive too fast,'' but not specifying what the speed limit is. You would never know if you had gone too fast until the highway patrolman pulled you over and told you whether you had gone too fast, according to that patrol person's view of what was ``too fast.'' 
   This is no way to create an enforceable, workable, worker safety regulation in a country that prides itself on being a country governed by laws, not people. 
   This proposal is simply unenforceable as it is written. It amounts to nothing more than a regulatory trap which will result in more citations, more fines, more litigation, more legal fees, more confusion, and more problems without protecting a single worker or making a single workplace safer. It is a big bullwhip to threaten employers without telling them how to avoid that which they seek to prevent. 
   Whatever other problems this regulation may cause for large employers, the problems will be catastrophic for many small businesses. It is impossible to overstate the complications and the burden this regulation could impose on small businesses. Small business owners simply do not have the time, expertise, resources, staff, or understanding of the issue to deal with this regulation while still performing all the other roles that are demanded of them as businesspeople as well as family members. 
   The same person who may handle sales, accounting, inventory, customer relations, and environmental compliance may also be responsible for safety compliance. With the vagueness of this proposal, the lack of a scientific consensus on what causes these injuries, the lack of a medical consensus on what is an effective remedy, and the naturally complicated nature of this issue, the typical small business owners will be so overwhelmed with this regulation, it will be a wonder if they decide they can both comply with the regulation and stay in business. Every hour they spend on this regulation--and despite OSHA's claims, there will be many--is an hour they will not use to do something that will further increase their business or create more jobs. For small business owners, time really is money. And if they are not dealing with all these roles in their business, they are probably trying to set aside a few hours a day to spend with their children and families. 
   The Small Business Administration did an analysis of this proposed rule. One of the points they made is that small businesses are not just large businesses with fewer employees, they function in an entirely different way. In addition to their lack of resources and staff, they may also have a different cash-flow structure, which means that the financial burden of this regulation cannot be absorbed as easily. 
   In many small businesses, they are more dependent on financing for their operating capital, so the cost of implementing this regulation will require the company to take on more debt, thus eroding further its opportunity to make a profit and grow and hire more employees. 
   Also, small businesses often exist as niche businesses to serve very special needs. They may not be able to pass costs along to their customer easily because the customer may be able to do without the niche product or be able to find it cheaper or more easily from a larger source. 
   Small businesses are the engine of this great economic expansion we have been enjoying recently. They are the ones that are creating the jobs. They are the ones that are creating the opportunity and creating the wealth for many families around this country. This rule will be sand that can cause this engine to seize up and stop dead in its tracks. 
   The Small Business Administration's study on this proposal found that OSHA underestimated the cost of this regulation by a factor of anywhere between 2 and 15 times. OSHA simply has no idea how much this regulation will cost businesses, and particularly small businesses. And businesses have no idea what they will get for the money they will be forced to spend. 
   Employers have no problem investing in safety to protect their employees, but when you ask them to spend excessive amounts, with no guarantee of what they will get in return, they are going to object, and object strenuously. 
   This weekend, when I was in Missouri, I talked to small businesses, small businesses that are very much concerned about this. Do you know what they said to me? They said to me: Look, we don't want to see repetitive motion injuries. We are very much concerned if one of our employees comes up with carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   One small business owner said: I have hired two different safety engineers to come in and work with the employees and me to find out where there might be an injury, to help us develop ways of preventing those injuries. We talk with and listen to our workers and say: What are we doing? What can we do differently? 
   He also said: I have paid a lot of money trying to find an answer. Wherever we can find an answer, we implement it, because it doesn't make any sense for me to lose good workers or to have them suffer the physical pain, which is great, or to have the loss of income which can come from one of  these on-the-job injuries. And it certainly does my business no good to be without a valued employee. 
   And he said: When we look at what OSHA is telling us, how come, if they are so smart, they can't tell me what specific things I can do? What are the standards? I paid these safety engineers to come in and help me, and they have done everything they can. And OSHA doesn't even come close. They are not even trying. They are just going to pull out that big bullwhip and whack me across the back if there is something I missed and something nobody understands can be done to prevent it. 
   Small businesses are such a vital part of the economy that, 5 years ago this month, I introduced what we call the Red Tape Reduction Act, but it is technically known as the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, or SBREFA. This act was passed by the Senate without a dissenting vote and signed by the President in March of 1996. 
   Among other provisions, the Red Tape Reduction Act requires OSHA to convene panels of small businesses to review regulations before they are proposed, at the time when their input can have the most impact. 
   OSHA convened their SBREFA panel for the ergonomics regulation in March 1999. It should be no surprise that the small businesses that reviewed this regulation thought it would be a nightmare to comply with. Even those businesses that were generally in favor of doing something about an ergonomics regulation, because of the possible ergonomics injuries and the pain they cause, believed that this proposal was seriously flawed and totally inadequate. In every category of question, the small businesses that reviewed this regulation found serious problems. The report was issued, and it contained many criticisms and complaints about the proposal. 
   I will mention a few of them:  
   Many [small businesses] felt that OSHA's preliminary cost estimates had underestimated costs. 
   Some [small businesses] felt that there may be substantial costs for firms to understand the rule and to determine whether they are covered by the rule, even for firms not required to have a basic program and who have not had an MSD. 
   Many [small businesses] expressed doubt over their capability to make either the initial determination about whether they need an ergonomics program or to implement an ergonomics program itself. Many [small businesses] felt that they would need the assistance of consultants to set up an ergonomics program and to assist them in their hazard identification and control activities. 
   Almost all of the [small businesses] stated that they would not be able to pass on the costs of an ergonomics program to their customers. The ability to pass through costs may be dependent on the level of domestic and foreign competition. 
   Many [small businesses] questioned OSHA's estimate that consultants would not be necessary for any element of the program except in 10% of those cases involving job fixes. 
   Many [small businesses] had difficulty understanding OSHA's criteria for determining the work-relatedness of MSDs. Many [small businesses] interpreted OSHA's criteria for determining the work-relatedness of MSDs in such a way that, in practice, the two criteria in addition to a recordable MSD would be unworkable or ignored. 
   Some [small businesses] expressed concerns about how certain terms and provisions of the draft rule would be interpreted and enforced by OSHA compliance personnel. Many [small businesses] found it difficult to apply the concepts of feasibility, similar jobs and manual handling, as these are defined in the draft rule. 
   Many [small businesses] ..... were concerned about perceived overlaps between State workers' compensation laws and the draft standards' medical removal protection requirements. 
   Some [small businesses] suggested that employers' increased concern about MSDs could create additional incentives for employers to discriminate against individuals who may be members of protected classes of employees based on the perceived likelihood that such workers would have more MSDs than other workers. 
   Many [small businesses] suggested that non-regulatory guidance would be preferable to a rule. 
   Some [small businesses] recommended that OSHA delay the ergonomics rule until the completion of the National Academy of Sciences study that is now underway.  
   Mr. President, those are some of the comments the small business panels offered when they looked at this atrocity. You would think with all these concerns and recommendations, OSHA would have made major changes to the proposed rule to take into account, as they were supposed to, the legitimate concerns of small business. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The changes that were made were merely cosmetic, not substantive, and did not address any of these issues raised by the small businesses. In fact, OSHA made so few changes to the draft that when thousands complained about the short comment period after it was published in November, OSHA claimed the fact that it had been released to the panel qualified as giving interested parties sufficient time to help them develop their comments. OSHA ignored the concerns raised by small businesses that gave up their time to participate in this process in the hopes of helping OSHA fashion a reasonable and responsible, better regulation. 
   They didn't want to know. They didn't pay attention. This is precisely what the Red Tape Reduction Act was meant to stop, when a Federal agency says: Ready, fire; we will worry about the aim later, and they didn't care about what aim they took. They didn't care about listening to the small businesses. This is a clear-cut example of abuse of the law that is designed to protect small businesses from excessive overreaching and inappropriate Federal regulation. 
   Unfortunately, this has been a consistent pattern of OSHA during the development of this regulation. There have been numerous stakeholder meetings and meetings with concerned businesses where OSHA received valuable guidance and suggestions that would have led to a better regulation. OSHA has not been willing to work with anyone from the employer community who would have to deal with this regulatory monstrosity. They have pursued their vision of this rule with a myopic tunnel vision that has shut out any and all recommendations that could make this regulation palatable and workable. The intransigence of OSHA in this rulemaking has been positively staggering. Unfortunately, this regulation threatens not only to stagger but to take the breath out of small businesses in the United States. 
   OSHA would have us believe that they must move forward because of the levels of musculoskeletal disorders occurring among employees. In fact, as employers have focused on MSDs, the numbers have been steadily declining, since 1994, by a total of 24 percent. These injuries now make up only 4 percent of all workplace injuries and illnesses. This progress has come about without an ergonomics regulation. 
   There is more that needs to be done, yes. We need to continue to work to find ways to reduce these painful and harmful injuries that cost time and pain to employees and deprive employers and small businesses of their ability to turn out product or a service and make a profit. Businesses are willing to consider what makes sense for their employees when there is a solution available. 
   I told you the story of one small business owner with whom I talked this week in Missouri. I have held conferences. At the National Women's Small Business Conference I held in Kansas City, they talked about problems facing women small business owners. They have problems with procurement. They have problems with access to capital. They are scared to death of what can happen to their businesses because they don't want to see their employees have MSDs or musculoskeletal disorders, 
   injuries from repetitive motions. 
   They told me they are working on ways to minimize them and eliminate them, but this regulation gives them no help in moving forward in their efforts, which they intend to continue, which are voluntary, which are effective, unlike this rule. There is no help for them in this regulation, just a bull whip, if something goes wrong. 
   This regulation does not provide a solution or any guidance that would be helpful to employers. If OSHA were smart, they would take a look at what is happening and get out of the way, or offer constructive assistance, help figure out ways to prevent these injuries. OSHA is trying not to reinvent the wheel but telling the wheel which way to go without giving it any guidance. 
   OSHA will claim they have made changes in response to the concerns of the businesses. They will point to the grandfather clause they included. That is truly a laugh. The only problem is the grandfather clause is worthless.  Not a single company in the country which currently has an ergonomics program could qualify for it. OSHA's grandfather clause requires a company to put OSHA's program in place so they can be relieved of having to comply with the OSHA program. That sounds absurd. It doesn't make any sense, but that is what they require. They said: If you will put into place this OSHA program, whatever it is--and nobody knows what it is--then you will have complied with the grandfather clause. But to our knowledge--and OSHA hasn't told us of any--nobody has one in place that meets the impossible and unworkable and unknowable standards of this rule and regulation. Grandfather? That looks like some other kind of relative, not often seen at a family picnic when you apply it to this clause. 
   OSHA's pursuit of this regulation has been so single minded, they have cut corners with the rulemaking process. Under the proposed regulation, an employer's obligation to implement the full ergonomics program is triggered when an employee has an OSHA-recordable MSD injury. OSHA's definition of a recordable MSD injury is one where ``exposure to work caused, contributed to the MSD, or aggravated a pre-existing MSD.'' An employee could actually have an injury caused entirely by nonwork-related factors. This regulation would require the employer to implement a full-blown ergonomics program if the employee's job requires them to do something as simple as standing, which aggravates the injury. 
   I have had an ergonomic injury trying to pull up carpet tacks in a new house. I spent a weekend pulling up carpet tacks. I could not move my arm the next day. I went into work. I couldn't use the typewriter, even a pen, but I knew what caused that: pulling up the carpet tacks and ripping up the rug. 
   Under this rule, if I had gone in and told the employer, darn, I can't use the typewriter, I can't pick up a pencil today, I can't lift the law books, under this definition, that would have been a recordable MSD injury for my employer. 
   That would not have made him happy. What is even more remarkable about this regulation is that the language comes directly from OSHA's 1996 proposal to revise the recordkeeping standard which has not yet been finalized. OSHA is actually trying to finalize their proposed recordkeeping standard by inserting that language in the ergonomics proposal. That is an outrage and a clear violation of the principles of fairness and disclosure that underlie the rulemaking process that must be and should be subject to challenge under SBREFA and the appropriate procedures and actions. 
   The fact that OSHA has taken liberties with the rulemaking process is hardly new. Most of us remember in January when OSHA tried to impose on employers the obligation to check the homes of employees who telecommute for safety hazards. OSHA was attempting to do this through a letter of interpretation in response to a legitimate inquiry from an employer. The outcry over this move was so loud and so bipartisan that the Secretary of Labor herself had to withdraw that crazy idea the next day. 
   One of the reasons OSHA's attempts blew up in their face so badly was because of this ergonomics regulation. Employers immediately realized that if they were responsible for safety hazards in an employee's home, the ergonomics regulation would require them to intrude into their employees' private lives far too deeply. The regulation already expects employers to be responsible for injuries that are not caused by workplace exposures. If employers were to be responsible for safety issues at home, there would be no limit to what they would have to cover. Employers would never be able to control the exposure to ergonomic risk factors in the home, or distinguish which risks were part of work activities and which risks were part of everyday life like picking up their children. 
   This is the most expensive, complicated, expansive, burdensome, and destructive regulation that OSHA has ever proposed. That is no small title to achieve. When you are dealing with OSHA, that is a high stump to jump. But they have done it on this one. Indeed, it could be one of the most burdensome regulations ever proposed by the Federal Government. OSHA is pursuing this regulation with no concern for the impact it would have on employers, or the fact that employees will lose their jobs because of this regulation. 
   I call on my colleagues to pass the Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to stop OSHA from finalizing this horribly flawed regulation and force them to reconsider their approach and listen to the scientific evidence and to the people who are making their best efforts, successful in part already today, to reduce ergonomics injuries. To vote against this amendment is to say that an agency can promulgate a regulation without providing an adequate scientific foundation, and they can impose a crushing burden that would drive small businesses out of business and deprive employees of their jobs without considering the impact. That must not be the case. 
   I strongly urge and beseech my colleagues to support this amendment and put a stop to a terribly bad idea before OSHA takes the bull whip to small businesses throughout this country.

   Mr. BOND. There is no time agreement? I thank the Chair. I will take such time as I require then. 
   Mr. President, my colleague from Ohio has offered an amendment which I believe takes us down the wrong tracks, very far in that direction. He has offered an amendment that would allow our precious highway resources to be used for Amtrak. 
   My colleague from Georgia has talked about the sad situation in Georgia where their highway funds are frozen because the courts have overturned a previous policy of the Federal Government to allow highway transportation projects to continue. I urge his and my other colleagues' support of my measure on conformity that would allow needed highway construction to go forward. 
   As to this amendment, many would argue this is an issue of States rights. That is just not the case. I am a former Governor. One would be hard pressed to find anyone in this body who is a stronger States rights advocate than I am. I intend to continue to be so. There will be those who will try to convince us this is anti-Amtrak. That is not the case. As Governor of the great State of Missouri, I was the one who ensured that my State provided its own resources in an effort to help subsidize Amtrak. 
   This is an issue of a dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose. We told the American people we were going to put the trust back into the trust fund. This is an issue of Congress upholding its end of the agreement with the American people. 
   It has just been 2 years this month since the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st century--better known as TEA-21--was signed into law. In my opinion, the most historic and the most important provision of TEA-21 was the funding guarantee that I authored with our late friend, Senator John Chafee, with the assistance and the guidance of the Budget and Appropriations Committees. Some called that provision RABA, or revenue aligned budget authority. Up here, it is often called the Chafee-Bond provision. In Missouri, we call it the Bond-Chafee provision. But the whole intent of that measure was very clear. We have a dedicated tax that was imposed on the American people for the purpose of highway improvement and safety issues. We lose too many lives in my State and in every State in this Nation because of inadequate highways. Over 30 percent of the deaths on our highways nationally are a result of inadequate highway and bridge conditions. 
   We told the American people for the first time we were going to allow them to trust the trust fund; that when they put the money in when they bought the gas at the pumps, we would put it back for highway trust fund purposes. That is what the funding must be spent on under the guarantee--highway improvements and safety issues. Because of the guarantee, our road and bridge improvements are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
   We drive on the road. We buy the gas. We pay the tax. We build better roads and safer roads to protect our citizens,  to 
   provide convenience and safety, to get rid of the pollution that comes from congestion, and to assure sound economic growth in our communities and in our States. 
   I don't think this debate should even occur. It should not even be an option for us to decide whether or not we will use the highway trust fund money for other purposes. How soon we forget. We made those decisions just 2 years ago in TEA-21. Do we want to reopen the whole highway funding and highway authorization measure again? Let's not start down the path of reopening TEA-21. We made accommodations. We made changes. We made compromises. We included other projects and other activities such as transit in TEA-21. We made a deal--not just with us but with the taxpaying American public. 
   Earlier this year, the administration proposed to divert funding coming from the highway trust fund to Amtrak and other purposes. At that time, my colleague from Ohio, I, and countless other Senators made it clear that we opposed the administration's attempt to rob the highway trust fund. I had an opportunity to discuss this with Secretary Slater at our Transportation appropriations hearing and suggested to him that ``this dog won't hunt.'' This dog isn't a much better hunter either. 
   I don't believe that the people in my State who pay the taxes or in the States of my colleagues who pay the taxes are going to be excited about this. This amendment is similar to the previous effort by the administration to divert funding. It takes us down the path of diluting our highway funding for purposes other than highways and highway safety. 
   I have a simple question for my colleagues to think about: Why are we talking about using our highway funds for Amtrak and not using our transit funds for Amtrak? I personally think transit funds would be more appropriate if it fit into the transit plan. OK. Let them use transit funds because that is essentially what Amtrak is; it is a form of transit. It should not be competing with the scarce dollars to build safe highways, roads, and bridges. 
   I remind my colleagues that we have a transportation infrastructure crisis on our hands. Two years ago, Governors, commissioners, highway departments, city officials, and everyday Americans told us we were not investing enough in our highway infrastructure. They let us know that the deterioration of our highways and bridges was having a tremendous impact on their local and State economies and, more importantly, on the safety of their citizens. We are still not getting enough money into highway improvements. The latest I heard, and to the best of my knowledge, no State in the Nation has even 80 percent of its highways up to a standard the Department of Transportation regards as fair. Every State, to my knowledge, has at least a 20-percent deficit in adequate highways, roads, and bridges. 
   These are just some of the reasons so many of us fought to ensure that we would keep our commitment to the American people regarding the highway trust Fund. 
   We increased spending on our Nation's highway infrastructure because our needs were much greater. I know with absolute certainty that the needs identified just 2 years ago have not gone away, and they are not going to go away if we continue to divert money and if we try to divert money from the highway trust fund. These needs still exist. 
   We told the people of America we would put trust back into the trust fund: Trust us. Trust us to spend your highway taxes 
   that go into the highway trust fund for highway trust fund purposes. 
   The National Highway System was part of the grand national scheme. This was a national scheme to ensure that people in any State in the Nation could travel to any other State in the Nation and be safe on a National Highway System. That is what this is all about. This isn't about States having their own little, independent highway programs with four-lane highways that end in a cornfield at somebody's border. This is about having a National Highway System where there is safe transit on interstate highways. 
   Trust fund taxpayers in my State, and your State, and every other State, expect when they pay the money in, it will go to assure that when they drive in their State or in any other State, they will be driving on safe highways; they will not be putting themselves and their loved ones and their families at risk from unsafe highway conditions. 
   To my donor State colleagues--those of us whose states pay more into the highway trust fund than they get out--think about this for a minute: You have highway needs in your State. Yet under this proposal, you would see the highway trust fund dollars your citizens put into the highway trust fund going into Amtrak. That is not keeping faith with the commitment we made in the highway trust fund. 
   Let's talk about States rights. I have often thought that maybe we really ought to do a States rights approach to this and let the States have all the money they raised. You want to talk about States rights. Let's keep the highway trust fund dollars in each State as they are contributing. That is States rights. 
   We agreed in TEA-21 that we were going to have a trust fund for a National Highway System--not a national Amtrak system. We are providing funds in this bill for Amtrak. 
   We know that improvements and repairs to our highway system will help improve driving conditions, will reduce driving costs to motorists, will relieve congestion, and will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities. The cost of repairing roads in poor condition can be about four times as great as repairing roads that are in fair condition. We have to keep our roads in at least fair condition. Our Nation's roads and bridges are at a high level of deterioration. 
   A recent headline in the Capital City newspaper in Missouri said that my State of Missouri ranks seventh nationally in poor bridges. We need to do something about those bridges; they are dangerous. The highways are dangerous and we need to do something about them. 
   Look at the other side. This is not an issue of trying to deny Amtrak resources. Senators SHELBY and LAUTENBERG included in the underlying Transportation bill, which I support, $521 million for Amtrak's capital program. I have supported that. That is $521 million for Amtrak for capital. That $521 million provided is consistent with the administration's request, and it is consistent with the so-called glidepath level of Federal funding agreed to by the administration and Amtrak. 
   We continue these huge Federal subsidies, even though Amtrak's financial situation is precarious at best. According to the Senate report, the Federal Railroad Administration has said that Amtrak ended the 1999 fiscal year with a net operating loss of $702 million. 
   Since 1971, Amtrak has received over $23 billion in Federal funding for operating and capital expenses. Despite Amtrak's efforts to improve and its new business plan, it is still not clear whether or not Amtrak will reach self-sufficiency. I said that I support the appropriation for Amtrak in the underlying bill. I have used Amtrak. I am happy to work with my colleagues in the Senate, my former fellow Governors, and others, to see that we put money into Amtrak. But this issue is not about Amtrak. This is an issue about keeping our commitment to the taxpaying citizens of our States and of this country, whom we told we were going to put the ``trust'' back in the highway trust fund. 
   I strongly oppose the Voinovich amendment because it violates that promise. We can't even keep a promise for 2 years. We said we were putting the ``trust'' back in the highway trust funds. That is what the highway trust fund is all about. I think this amendment violates the agreement made during TEA-21, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the Voinovich amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements Act of 2000. This important legislation was recently considered by the Committee on Small Business and approved by an 18-0 vote. I am also offering a ``Managers' Amendment,'' which has been approved on both sides of the aisle. 
   The purpose of H.R. 2614 is to make the 504 Certified Development Company program a more effective and more efficient program. The 504 Program is a key credit program run by the Small Business Administration to provide access to capital to small business owners. It was enacted to leverage private sector resources to fund larger projects for small businesses to acquire, construct or expand their facilities. Specifically, it was designed to create job opportunities and improve the economic health of both rural and inner city communities. 
   Unlike most government-guaranteed loan programs, the 504 loan is subordinate to a loan made by a private lender. SBA guarantees 10- or 20-year debentures issued by Certified Development Companies (CDC), and the proceeds from the sales of these debentures to investors are used to fund the 504 loans. Usually, the conventional loan will finance 50 percent of the project's cost, and the SBA-guaranteed 504 loan cannot exceed 40 percent of the project cost. In the event of a default of the 504 small business borrower, the bank's loan is senior to the SBA-guaranteed 504 loan. 
   504 LOAN DEFAULTS AND RECOVERIES
   Over the past 5 years, the Committee on Small Business has devoted considerable attention to the 504 program. The committee has been particularly concerned about reports and testimony from the SBA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) about loan recoveries following a default by a borrowers on a loan made under the program. Historically, in nearly all cases when a 504 program borrower defaults, it is the SBA, not the CDC, that take the required liquidation and foreclosure actions. The failure of the SBA to take aggressive actions to recover the value of collateral held following a default significantly increases the costs to borrowers to obtain a loan under the 504 program. 
   In response to the continuing problem of low recoveries under the 504 program, the committee, in 1996, approved legislation establishing a pilot program that allowed approximately 20 CDCs to liquidate loan that they originate. Results from the pilot have been encouraging, and the committee concluded that it is in the best interest of the 504 program to allow additional CDC's to conduct their own liquidation and foreclosure activities. Section 7 of H.R. 2614, as reported by the Committee on Small Business, makes the pilot liquidation program permanent and requires SBA to permit certain CDC's to foreclose and liquidate defaulted loans 
   that they have originated under the 504 loan program.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mark Lamping, President of the St. Louis Cardinals. Today, the St. Louis Catholic Youth Council presented its Annual Achievement Award for the year 2000 to Mr. Lamping. His tenure as head of the Cardinals has seen a 1996 Central Division championship, a return to post-season play for the first time since 1987, and a complete renovation of Busch Stadium. In 1999, his dedication as President enabled the Cardinals to receive the honor of Major League Baseball's Fan Friendly team by the United Sports Fans of America for the Cardinals' outstanding efforts at making the ballpark a more enjoyable, affordable, and memorable experience for the paying public. 
   In February of 1994, after serving for five years as Anheuser-Busch's group Director of Sports Marketing, Mr. Lamping was appointed Commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association. While in this position, Mr. Lamping managed the company's TV and radio sports marketing activities for all Anheuser-Busch beer brands, including sponsorship agreements with the Olympics, World Cup, the National  Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, and all other major professional sports. 
   Mr. Lamping's accomplishments are not limited to the realm of sports; he also gained experience in the corporate world. In 1981, Mr. Lamping joined the Anheuser-Busch family and began his work as a financial analyst within the company's corporate planning division. He then moved on to serve as the District Manager in Southern Illinois and Central Iowa. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Lamping served as the Senior Brand Manager for New Products and the Director of Sales Operations.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my amendment affects every State in the Nation--the Bond-Bryan amendment to S. 2549. As co-chair of the Senate Guard Caucus, I firmly believe that this important piece of legislation is critical to meeting the number one priority of the National Guard--full-time support. As you know, the National Guard relies heavily upon full-time employees to ensure readiness. By performing their critical duties on a daily basis, these  hard-working men and women ensure drill and annual training remain focused on preparation for war fighting and conducting peacetime missions. 
   During the cold war, Guard and Reserve forces were underutilized. During the 1980's, for example, they numbered more than one million personnel but contributed support to the active forces at a rate of fewer than 1 million work days per year. 
   At the end of the cold war, force structure and personnel endstrength were drastically cut in all the active services. Almost immediately, the nation discovered that the post-cold-war world is a complex, dangerous, and expensive place. Deployments for contingency operations, peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and counter-terrorism operations increased dramatically. Most recently, our forces have been called upon to destroy the capability of Saddam Hussein and his forces, bring peace and stability to Haiti, force Slobodan Milosevic and his forces out of Kosovo, ensure a safe, stable and secure environment in the Balkans, and rescue and rebuild from natural disasters at home and abroad. 
   Because of the increased deployments and the reduction in the active force, we became significantly more dependent on the Army and Air National Guard. In striking contrast to cold war levels of contributory support, today's Guard and Reserve forces are providing approximately 13 million work days of support to the active components on an annual basis--a thirteen-fold increase and equivalent to the addition of some 35,000 personnel to active component end strength, or two Army divisions. For example, the 49th Armored Division from the Lone Star State is currently leading operations in Kosovo, and the Army just identified four more Guard units for deployment to Kosovo. 
   With this shift in reliance from the active force to the Guard came the obligation to increase Guard staffing to keep pace with the expanded mission. The Army and Air National Guard established increased full-time staffing as their number one priority. We agreed with them, but we have not yet held up our end of the bargain. We gave them the mission; we must now give them the personnel resources to accomplish it. 
   The Department of Defense has identified a shortfall in full-time manning of 1,052 ``AGRs'' (Active Guard/Reserves) and 1,543 Technicians. Frankly, I agree with their numbers, but I do not see how we can afford immediately to increase their staffing to those levels. Accordingly, the Bond-Bryan amendment proposes an incremental increase in the number of full-time positions. We ask that S. 2549 be amended to provide for an additional 526 ``AGRs'' (Active Guard/Reserves) and 771 Technicians. As you can see, this is about half of what the Guard requested, and far less than what was requested in the past. We believe these additional positions will give the Guard the minimum it needs to do the job, while providing the opportunity to reexamine the situation during the next fiscal year. 
   When we expand the mission, when we increase operating tempo, and when we ask for greater effort; we have to realize that increased funding is often necessary and appropriate. In this case, we have attempted to provide the minimum additional personnel to accomplish a mission we previously assigned but did not fully resource. Your support for this amendment sends a strong message to your constituents and the Guard units in your state that you support the National Guard in its significant role in our Nation's defense, and that you are willing to give the men and women in its ranks the resources to do the job. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator WARNER, Senator LEVIN, my co-chair, Senator BRYAN, and our esteemed colleagues for your support of this critical issue.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the Small Business Relief Act of 2000. This bill will provide a lifeline for the thousands of small business owners threatened by lawsuits and litigation under the broken Superfund liability system. 
   This bill is simple. All this bill does is relieve innocent small business owners from superfund liability unless it is demonstrated that the small business is guilty of gross negligence or did contribute significantly to the toxic waste at the superfund site. 
   My bill will not let polluters off the hook. This common-sense proposal will make the Superfund program a little more reasonable and workable. With this legislation, we can begin to provide some relief to small business owners who are held hostage by potential Superfund liability. 
   For years now, members from both sides of the aisle have said that the Superfund program is broken, it doesn't work, it must be reformed. Unfortunately we haven't gotten past the rhetoric to fix the problem. Instead of making changes that will produce results that are better for the taxpayers, better for the environment, and more efficient for everyone involved--government agencies, federal bureaucrats, and Congress has protected this troubled and inefficient program from meaningful reform. 
   As Washington has played politics with the Superfund program, innocent Main Street small business owners across the nation, the engine of our economy, continue to be unfairly pulled into Superfund's legal quagmire. Even the EPA has stated its support for protecting restaurant owners, mom-and-pop convenience store operators, and other small business owners who have legally disposed of their trash and cannot afford the tab that comes with Superfund legal bills. 
   Let's put a human face on this: last year, just across the Missouri border--in Quincy, Illinois--160 small business owners were asked to pay the EPA more than $3 million for garbage legally hauled to a dump more than 20 years ago. The situation in Quincy is just one example of the very real, ongoing Superfund legal threat to small business owners across the nation. 
   Mr. President, we all know that Superfund was created to clean up the nation's most-hazardous waste sites. Superfund was not created to have small business owners sued for simply throwing out their trash! These small business owners are faced with so many challenges already, that the thousands of dollars in penalties and lawsuits leave them with no choice but to mortgage their businesses, their employees and their future to pay for the bills of a broken government program. 
   How many times will we tell ourselves that this unacceptable situation must be fixed before we act? Small business owners literally cannot afford to wait around while we delay action on the common-sense fixes required to protect them and our environment. 
   In recognition of our small businesses around the country and Small Business Week, I introduce this bill and look forward to leading the fight to ensure timely adoption of this long-overdue legislation.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to rise in recognition of Small Business Week 2000. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have participated in a number of activities this week. I urge all of my colleagues who may not have done so to consider working with, identifying with, and listening to the small businesses in their State. I think today it is appropriate that we recognize some of the small business trends of the future. 
   Most of us know that the prototypical entrepreneur of the last century--or of the 1900s; the manufacturing age--was a man, inventing something in his garage or basement, which became the basis for a Fortune 500 company. The prototypical entrepreneur of the 21st century--the information and service age--is a woman trying to run her household, keep her kids fed and cared for, who comes up with a good idea that she can turn into a business. 
   Women have started businesses in record numbers over the last 10 years. They are driving the economy. They are helping to expand opportunities and provide good payrolls for their workers. They are willing to use the new information technologies even more than men. The explosion of capabilities through information technologies certainly opens up a range for a whole new series of undertakings.  
   The number of small businesses owned and controlled by women is expanding at a very rapid rate. Today, small businesses owned by women total 30 percent of all businesses in the United States. Their numbers are expanding at such a pace it is anticipated that women-owned small businesses will make up over 50 percent of all businesses by 2010. Given where we came from, that is a gratifying and astounding statistic. 
   But for all the good news, women-owned small businesses still face some age-old obstacles in starting and running their businesses: work and family conflicts, a lack of access to capital, and complex regulatory and tax issues. 
   In addition, yesterday the Senate adopted a resolution I sponsored, S. Res. 311, that was adopted unanimously. I express my appreciation to my colleagues for adopting it. It called attention to the Federal Government's failure to meet the statutory goal to award 5 percent of Federal contract dollars to women-owned small businesses. 
   The members of the Small Business Committee who joined me in cosponsoring this resolution included my ranking member, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts, and also sponsoring it were Senators BURNS, SNOWE, LANDRIEU, LIEBERMAN, EDWARDS, as well as Senator ABRAHAM, who authored last year's initiative in the committee to help women reach the 5-percent goal. In addition, Senators BINGAMAN and MURRAY joined us as cosponsors of the resolution. 
   In 1994, Congress recognized the important role women-owned small businesses played in our economy. During the consideration of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Senate approved a provision directing that 5 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be awarded each year to women-owned small businesses. The goal includes 5 percent of prime contract dollars and 5 percent of subcontract dollars, and was included in the final conference report enacted into law. 
   The Federal Departments and Agencies have failed to meet that 5-percent goal enacted in 1994. After Senator ABRAHAM chaired a committee field hearing in Michigan on the state of women business owners, he offered an amendment addressing the failure of the Federal Departments and Agencies to meet the 5-percent goal during the Small Business Committee markup of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. 
   That was adopted unanimously by the committee and enacted into law as Public Law 106-165, which directed that GAO undertake an audit of Federal procurement systems and their impact on women-owned small businesses. 
   The statistics for Federal procurement in fiscal year 1999 have just been released. Again, the 5-percent goal for women-owned small businesses was not met. It fell over 50 percent short of the goal, reaching only 2.4 percent. The administration's failure to reach that goal was the subject of the resolution, which resolved that the Senate strongly urge the President to adopt a policy in support of the 5-percent goal for women-owned small businesses, to encourage the heads of the Federal Departments to make a concentrated effort to meet the 5-percent goal before the end of fiscal year 2000. I understand the President has now issued an Executive order. But the second part of the resolution says the President should hold the heads of Federal Departments and Agencies accountable to ensure that the 5-percent goal is achieved during this year. 
   But these are just some of the issues confronting women-owned small businesses. I am very pleased to say I have been joined by Senator KERRY of Massachusetts, Senator SNOWE, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator HUTCHISON of Texas to convene a National Women's Business Summit on June 4 and 5 of this year in Kansas City, MO. This summit will give women small business owners a chance to tell Congress and the next President what they need and what will work. Their agenda will serve as the women's small business agenda for the next Congress and the next President. 
   I might add that we have nationally known women and professional business leaders, as well as bipartisan government servants, who will be talking with the participants in the conference. I invite women who are engaged in and concerned about small business to participate. More information can be found about the summit on my Senate office web site at www.Senate.gov/bond or they can call us through the Capitol number: (202) 224-3121. We would be happy to provide them information. 
   I think it will be a very interesting and worthwhile endeavor in Kansas City. I am looking forward to participating. I know we will have many good ideas, based on the women participating in that conference, on how we can help the fastest growing and most important new sector of the economy--women-owned small businesses in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, when journalists and political scientists write about the activities here, they often prepare articles about how a bill becomes a law. That is an interesting study, but it is only half of the story. In fact, it is equally interesting to see how a law becomes a program--how words on the law books are transformed into a working program that delivers services to our constituents. 
   The key to that process is people. Ultimately, someone has to take responsibility for carrying out the laws we craft here. Today I want to recognize a group of people who are aggressively working to give life to the HUBZone program we passed in 1997. 
   The HUBZone program seeks to use the Government's purchasing power to encourage economic growth and job creation in the Nation's most intransigent areas of poverty and unemployment. These areas often present the greatest challenge because they lack a strong customer base. 
   As a result, small businesses tend not to locate in these areas, preferring to set up their operations in more prosperous areas that have an established stream of customer traffic. The HUBZone program seeks to offset this imbalance by making the Government a customer to firms willing to invest in these hard-to-reach communities. 
   Over two years have passed since the HUBZone program was signed into law, but progress has been very slow. Recently the Small Business Administration certified the 1,000th HUBZone small business concern, a major milestone. However, the need is much greater. Without a large base of certified firms, the Government will not have enough participating companies to do business on the scale we envisioned in writing the program. 
   Because of this lack of certified companies, some agencies are throwing up their hands and opting not to carry out the HUBZone law. Without enough vendors to bid on contracts, some agencies are letting this tremendous new resource sit idle. 
   Defense Department agencies in the New England States have proved an exception to that rule. The Northeast Regional Council, which comprises small business officers from Defense agencies and Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, along with defense contractors large and small, created a special High Performance Team dubbed ``The Matchmakers'' to identify problems in implementing the HUBZone program and to work aggressively to solve them. 
   The Matchmakers found six components that were mismatched (``the hexa-mismatch problem''): contract requirements, suppliers, commodities, agency databases, education and benefits under the program, and the HUBZones themselves. For example, commodities to be purchased were not matched with suppliers who could provide them, and those suppliers were not necessarily matched to HUBZone areas that would make them eligible to participate. 
   Having distilled the problem to its most basic elements, the Matchmakers are now setting out to track down suppliers who could fill the agencies' procurement needs, identify those that are located in HUBZones, educate them about the program benefits, and get them to apply for certification. 
   Mr. President, this kind of aggressive action is exactly what is necessary to transform the HUBZone Act from mere words on a page into a program that helps real people and communities. Someday, when the HUBZone program is delivering benefits and creating jobs for people who currently do not have them, it will be essential to remember the people who made it possible. So that their names are not forgotten, I ask to include in the RECORD a list of the members of the Matchmakers High Performance Team, and I call the attention of my colleagues to their leadership and hard work.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to submit a resolution recognizing the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri as a national World War I symbol. I am pleased that Senator ASHCROFT and Senator ROBERTS are joining me as original cosponsors. 
   Fighting in the trenches in Europe, America's sons and daughters defended liberty and our country through service in World War One. We want to ensure that the sacrifices they made are  not forgotten. The Liberty Memorial serves as a long-standing tribute to their accomplishments. 
   More than 4 million Americans served in World War One, however, the Liberty Memorial is the only major memorial and museum honoring their courage and loyalty. It is important to me that these men and women have an appropriate national symbol; they deserve to be recognized and honored. The Liberty Memorial serves as a constant reminder of the patriotism and sacrifice that the War evoked, both to the people of Kansas City, and across the country. 
   In 1919, Kansas Citians expressed an unprecedented outpouring of support, raising $2.5 million in less than two weeks. Three years later the five Allied military leaders met in Kansas City, marking the only time in history all five leaders came togther at one place. The leaders from Belgium, Italy, France, Great Brittan and the United States looked on, as the site for the Liberty Memorial was dedicated. Since that historic occasion, many other great world leaders have addressed the public at the Liberty Memorial including: Presidents Calvin Coolidge, Harry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and William Howard Taft. 
   The Liberty Memorial opened to the public in 1926. It is an amazing structure; the impressive size and design puts it in a class with monuments here on the National Mall. The Memorial Tower is 217-feet-tall. The four Guardian Spirits: Honor, Courage, Patriotism, and Sacrifice, encircle the top of the tower. This is a great, inspirational work of art that serves as an outstanding tribute to America's sons and daughters of World War I. 
   In addition to the Memorial Tower, there is a Liberty Memorial Museum located within the complex. This museum promotes and encourages a better understanding of the sacrifices and progress made during World War I. While the Memorial undergoes a major renovation project, the museum is currently closed to the public. Upon its reopening, visitors from around the world can come to Kansas City to view the finest collection of World War I memorabilia in the United States. These fascinating displays are arranged to give visitors insight into America's role in the First World War. 
   The Memorial's history, consistent local support and its location in the Heart of America, makes the Liberty Memorial an ideal national tribute to all Americans who fought in World War One. I am proud to have such a distinguished Memorial in my home state of Missouri. 
   Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely fashion so that we can properly honor the veterans of World War One with a national monument, and recognize the significance of the Liberty Memorial.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate Resolution I introduce today which calls attention to the Federal Government's failure to meet the statutory goal to award 5 percent of Federal contract dollars to women-owned small businesses. I am very pleased that members of the Senate Committee on Small Business have cosponsored this Resolution, including the committee's ranking member, Senator KERRY, Senator BURNS, Senator SNOWE, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator EDWARDS and Senator ABRAHAM, who authored last year's initiative in the committee to help women reach the 5-percent goal. In addition, Senators BINGAMAN and MURRAY have joined us as cosponsors of the resolution. 
   This is Small Business Week 2000. It is very appropriate that we recognize the important roles played of women-owned small businesses in our Nation's  economy and communities. The number of small businesses owned and controlled by women is expanding at a very rapid rate, and today, they total 38 percent of all businesses in the United States. Importantly, their numbers are expanding at such a pace that it is anticipated women-owned small businesses will make up over 50 percent of all businesses by 2010. That is an astounding statistic. 
   In 1994, Congress recognized the important role women-owned small businesses play in our economy. During the consideration of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, FASA, the Senate approved a provision directing that 5 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be awarded each year to women-owned small businesses. The goal includes 5 percent of prime contract dollars and 5 percent of subcontract dollars and was included in the final FASA Conference Report and enacted into law. 
   The Federal departments and agencies have failed to meet the 5 percent goal since it was enacted by Congress in 1994. After Senator ABRAHAM chaired a committee field hearing in Michigan on the state of women business owners, he offered an amendment addressing the failure of the Federal departments and agencies to meet the 5 percent goal during the Committee on Small Business markup of the ``Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999,'' S. 791. The amendment was adopted unanimously by the Committee and enacted into law, Public Law 106-165. It directed the General Accounting Office to undertake an audit of the Federal procurement system and its impact on women-owned small businesses, which is underway at this time. 
   The statistics for Federal procurement for FY 1999 have been released. Again, the 5 percent goal for women-owned small businesses was not met--and again the Federal departments and agencies fell over 50 percent short of the goal--reaching only 2.4 percent. The failure of the Administration to meet this goal, which is designed to produce opportunities for start-up and growing small, women-owned businesses, is disturbing. Over 5 years have passed since the enactment of 
   FASA, and the Federal Government continues to respond by taking baby steps toward meeting this Congressionally-mandated goal. 
   The resolution before the Senate today urges the President to adopt an administration policy in support of the 5-percent goal. Further, the resolution urges the President to go to the heart of the problem--to those Federal departments and agencies that are not carrying their share of the burden in meeting the goal. Specifically, the resolution asks the President to hold the head of each department and agency accountable for meeting the 5-percent goal. 
   Is it asking too much to require cabinet secretaries and agency heads to work harder to comply with a statutory goal? Of course not. It's all a matter of priorities. And I think supporting women-owned business should and must be a priority for each and every cabinet secretary and agency head. In other words, we are demanding performance not promises. 
   Were it not for the growth of the small business community over the past decade, our economy would not be its booming self. Women-owned small businesses have contributed significantly to our economic strength and stability. We need to help stimulate this growth to strengthen further the foundation of our business success. The 5 percent Federal procurement goal is a significant component to help women-owned business to start-up and flourish. 
   We should not lose sight of the fact that our laws are not keeping up with the new realities of business, particularly for women-owned businesses, who are heating up the economy. We need to be ever vigilant and remain alert to changes in the business climate so that laws and government policies are relevant and helpful. We in Congress should be prepared to jettison antiquated laws. And we need to recognize that occasionally the best government policy will be to step aside to avoid hindering progress and growth. 
   Future Congresses and Administrations will have a tremendous impact on the success of women-owned businesses. That is why I am joining with Senators KERRY, OLYMPIA SNOWE, MARY LANDRIEU, DIANNE FEINSTEIN, and KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON to convene a National Women's Business Summit on June 4-5, 2000, in Kansas City, Missouri. The summit will give women small business owners the opportunity to help formulate national policies on women's small business issues by gathering input from women business leaders, elected officials and other experts. Results and recommendations from this summit will be communicated directly to the Congress. More information about the summit can be found on my Senate office Web site at www.senate.gov/bond. 
   As we begin Small Business Week, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will take a moment and recognize the important role small businesses play in our economy. And I urge them to reinforce their support for the 5-percent Federal procurement goal and women-owned small businesses by voting in favor of the Senate resolution.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today with Senators KERRY, CAMPBELL, MURKOWSKI, STEVENS, DASCHLE, and BAUCUS will expand economic opportunity in some of the most stubborn areas of poverty and unemployment in the entire country. It will do so by expanding the HUBZone program to ensure that Indian Tribal enterprises and Alaska Native Corporations are eligible to participate. 
   The HUBZone program, enacted in 1997, directs a portion of Federal contracting dollars into areas of the country that have been out of the economic mainstream for far too long. HUBZone areas, which include, qualified census tracts, poor rural counties, and Indian reservations, often are relatively out-of-the-way places that the stream of commerce passes by. They tend to be low-traffic areas that do not have a reliable customer base to support business development. As a result, business has been reluctant to move into these areas. It simply has not been profitable, without a customer base to keep them operating. 
   The HUBZone Act seeks to overcome this problem by making it possible for the Federal government to become a customer for small businesses that locate in HUBZones. While a small business works to establish its regular customer base, a Federal contract can help it stabilize its revenues and remain profitable. This gives small business a chance to get a foothold, and provides jobs to these areas. New business and new jobs mean new life and new hope for these communities. 
   The HUBZone Act seeks to restart the economic engine in these communities and keep it running. Small business is the carburetor that makes that engine run smoothly. If a community seeks to attract a large business, often with expensive tax concessions and promises of public works, that community can find itself back where it started if that large business becomes unprofitable and closes its plant. However, if a community attracts a diversified base of small businesses its overall economic development does not stop just because one or two of those businesses close. That is why small business must be a central part of any economic development strategy. 
   Unfortunately, when we wrote the HUBZone Act three years ago, we accidentally created a technical glitch that excludes Indian Tribal enterprises and Alaska Native Corporations. These businesses must play a central role in improving life in rural Alaska and on Indian reservations. That is why we are here to propose a solution to this problem. 
   In the HUBZone Act, we specified that participating small businesses must be 100 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. However, since citizens are ``born or naturalized'' under the Fourteenth Amendment, ownership by citizens implies ownership by individual flesh-and-blood human beings. Corporate owners and Tribal government owners are not ``born or naturalized'' in the usual meanings of those terms. Thus, the Small Business Administration found that it had no authority to certify small businesses owned wholly or partly by Alaska Native Corporations and Tribal governments. 
   Although the legal logic of that view seems sound, the outcome is not. It certainly is not what we intended. On many reservations, particularly the desolate, isolated ones in western State, the 
   only investment resources available are the Tribal governments. Excluding those governments from investing in their own reservations means, in practical terms, excluding those reservations from the HUBZone program entirely. Similarly, Alaska Native Corporations have the corporate resources that are necessary to make real investments in rural Alaska, to provide jobs to Alaska Natives who currently have no hope of getting them. 
   That is why we are here to propose a legislative fix. In putting together this bill, we have sought to follow three broad principles. 
   First, no firm should be made eligible solely by virtue of who they are. We should not, for example, make all Alaska Native Corporations eligible solely because they are Alaska Native Corporations. Instead, Alaska Native Corporations and Indian Tribal enterprises should be eligible only if they agree to advance the goals of the HUBZone program: job creation and economic development in the areas that need it most. 
   Second, our legislation should seek to conform to existing Native American policy and not allow the HUBZone  program to be used as a back door to change that policy. Some folks would like to change Alaska Native policy so that Alaska Natives exercise governmental jurisdiction over their lands, just like Tribes in the Lower 48 do on their reservations and trust lands. However, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 deliberately avoided that approach, and our legislation here simply recognizes existing practice in ANCSA. 
   The third principle underlying this bill is that Alaska Natives and Indian Tribes should participate on more-or-less equal grounds. It is impossible to have exact equivalence because the Federal relationship with Alaska Natives is not equal to the relationship with Indian Tribes, and also because Alaska is a very different State from the Lower 48. However, ANCSA provided that Alaska Natives should be eligible to participate in Federal Indian programs ``on the same basis as other Native Americans.''

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 with my colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN. Our bill will accomplish the following: 1. Phases down to elimination MTBE within 3 years of enactment; 2. Maintains the oxygenate standard; 3. Probably has the strongest environmental anti-backsliding provisions of any bill; 4. A temporary waiver from oxygenate standard could be granted if the USDA and DOE certify that there is an issue with supply; and 5. Highway apportionment percentages will stay the same. 
   Low grain prices high fuel prices, and the clean water problems associated with MTBE have highlighted the need for this bipartisan effort to protect our water, protect our air, and to protect our rural economy. Our region and the nation require a renewable, environmentally friendly alternative to MTBE that helps create local jobs, which adds value to our farmer's product, which moves us away from an energy-hostage situation where our reliance on foreign-produced oil makes our producers, consumers and economy subject to the whims of international cartel autocrats, and protects our air and water. 
   My colleagues and friends on this issue, Senators DASCHLE and LUGAR, have also introduced a bill on this issue. I commend them for their involvement and look forward to working with them; however, I do not believe their bill solves all the problems. Specifically, their bill eliminates the oxygenate requirement. 
   The federal oxygen-content requirement was adopted for several reasons. First, Congress understood that oxygenates provide a source of clean octane-displacing toxic compounds such as benzene and reducing ozone-forming exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Second, Congress recognized the energy-security benefits of substituting a certain percentage of imported petroleum with domestically-produced, renewable fuels such as ethanol. Finally, the Congress hoped the Federal oxygen requirement could provide new market opportunities for farmers by stimulating new demand for ethanol. I believe each of these objectives remain as valid today as they were in 1990. 
   Unfortunately, the refiners' decision to utilize MTBE, rather than ethanol, has created a serious and growing problem nationwide. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that MTBE has been detected in 21 percent of the drinking water wells in RFG areas nationwide. States with detected MTBE water contamination include Missouri, Illinois, California, Texas, Virginia, Florida, Connecticut, and many more. 
   It is important to recognize that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 did not mandate the use of MTBE. Indeed, in Chicago and other areas where ethanol RFG is used, the program has been declared a huge air quality success. Replicating the Chicago ethanol RFG model in areas where MTBE is being used today would assure continued air quality progress without compromising water quality by its use. It would also provide a tremendous economic stimulus to rural America by creating value-added demand for as  much as 500 million bushels of grain. The Department of Agriculture recently reported that replacing MTBE with ethanol in RFG markets would increase net farm income $1 billion annually, create 13,000 new jobs, enhance our balance of trade and reduce farm program costs over the next ten years. Moreover, USDA reports ethanol can replace MTBE without price spikes or shortages in supplies within three years. 
   Let us be very clear about this issue. The environmental problem at hand is real. However, the problem is not ethanol, the problem is MTBE. 
   Fortunately some States are already taking action to ban MTBE. Some are not moving fast enough. We need to make certain that all States ban MTBE to eliminate its contamination of our water supplies. To ensure that we do not have a piecemeal approach to banning MTBE it is important to pass legislation to ensure we have a national solution. 
   This bill is supported by the National Corn Growers, Missouri Corn Growers, Renewable Fuels Association, and the Missouri Farm Bureau. I look forward to other groups supporting this bill as well. 
   I am pleased that Senator DURBIN, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator ASHCROFT have joined me in introducing this vitally important bill. I look forward to working with them and all the other members that join us in this endeavor to ensure that we have a national solution that will protect our water and still ensure that we maintain our air quality benefits produced from the Federal oxygenate requirement. In addition, we will be promoting positive energy and rural economic policy objectives, which includes ethanol.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank Senator KERRY for the work he and I have done over the years on early childhood education. This amendment by Senators STEVENS and JEFFORDS and others builds on that because we know that early in a child's development is the best time to begin the process of assuring that child is well educated, well prepared--the very earliest stages in life. This amendment recognizes if we do everything possible for our Nation's children in their overall education, we should begin at the earliest years. 
   While most of the debate on this bill will be about elementary and secondary education--the years of what we might call formal schooling--the education and mental development of a child begins long before that child enters kindergarten. In fact, the education and development of a child begins practically at birth and continues at an extremely rapid pace through the first several years of life. 
   This amendment recognizes this basic fact--that a child's education and mental development begins very early in life. Through this amendment, we are seeking to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood education care programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need. 
   This amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible for our nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus on the earliest years as well as the years of formal schooling. We can do this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and expanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working right now on the local level. These programs help parents to stimulate and educate their young children in an effort to make sure every child enters kindergarten fully ready to learn. 
   I am pleased to say that this amendment is based on the basic ideas and principles I set forth in legislation that was first introduced several years ago with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY. 
   Research shows that the first years of life are an absolutely crucial developmental period for each child with a significant bearing on future prospects. During this time, infant brain development occurs very rapidly, and the sensations and experiences of this time go a long way toward shaping that baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting effects on all aspects of the child's life. 
   And parents and family are really the key to this development. Early, positive interaction with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncle, and other adults plays a critical role. 
   Really we shouldn't be surprised that parents have known instinctively for generations some of these basic truths that science is just now figuring out. Most parents just know that babies need to be hugged, caressed, and spoken to. 
   Of course, the types of interaction that can most enhance a child's development change as the baby's body and mind grow. The best types of positive interaction--which are so instinctual to us for the youngest babies--may not be quite so obvious for two- and three-year-olds. Raising a child is perhaps the most important thing any of us will do, but it is also one of the most complicated. 
   And parents today also face a variety of stresses and problems that were unheard of a generation ago. In many families, both parents work. Whether  by choice or by necessity, many parents may not be able to read mountains of books and articles about parenting and child development to keep perfectly up-to-date on what types of experiences are most appropriate for their child at his or her particular stage of development. They also must try to find good child care and good environments where their children can be stimulated and educated while they work. Simply put, most parents can probably use a little help to figure out how best to help a child's mind and imagination to grow as much as possible. 
   Many communities across the country have developed successful early childhood development programs to meet these needs. Most of the programs work with parents to help them understand their child's development and to discuss ways to help further develop the little baby's potential. Others simply provide basic child care and an exciting learning environment for children of parents who both have to work. 
   In a report released in 1998, the prestigious RAND Corporation reviewed early childhood programs like these and found that they provide children, particularly high-risk children, with both short- and long-run benefits. These benefits include enhanced development of both the mind and the child's ability to interact with others. They include improvement in educational outcomes. And they include a long-term increase in self-sufficiency through finding jobs and staying off government programs and staying out of the criminal justice system. 
   Of course, it's no mystery to people from my home state of Missouri that this type of program can be successful. Missouri is the ``Show Me'' state, an we have been shown first-hand the benefit of a top-notice early childhood program. In Missouri, we are both proud and lucky to be the home of Parents as Teachers. 
   This tremendous organization is an early childhood parent education program designed to empower the parents to give their young child the best possible start in life. It provides education for the parent on a volunteer basis. Over 150,000 Missouri families are participating in it, with 200,000 children benefiting from it. It combines visits by the parent/educator in the home to see the progress of the child. It provides ideas and information to the parent to stimulate that child's learning curiosity. It brings parents and children together in group sessions to discuss common problems. 
   This program has been shown, by independent tests, to improve significantly the learning capacity of children when they reach formal schooling years. In addition, it hooks the parents into their child's education for the future years. I personally, from my visits to over 100 of these sites around my State, can tell you it is clear to the teachers, to the administrators, to the school board members, children who have been in Parents as Teachers have an excellent start and they are above and ahead of the other children who have not been so lucky. 
   This program is available through every school district in our State. I have talked to mothers coming off welfare who say it is the most important thing for their children. I have talked to farm families who are struggling to make a living off the farm, who say it is the best thing that can happen to their children. I have talked to economically successful suburban families; mom and dad both have good jobs, not enough time, but Parents as Teachers gives them the direction and the tools so they can be the best first teachers of their children. 
   That is why it is called Parents as Teachers. 
   With additional resources, programs such as Parents as Teachers could be expanded and enhanced to improve the opportunities for many more infants and young children. And we have found that all children can benefit from these programs. Economically successful, two-income families can benefit from early childhood programs just as much as a single-parent family with a mother seeking work opportunities. 
   This amendment will support families by building on local initiatives like Parents as Teachers that have already been proven successful in working with families as they raise their infants and toddlers. The bill will help improve and expand these successful programs, of which there are numerous other examples, such as programs sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as state initiatives such as ``Success by Six'' in Massachusetts and Vermont and the ``Early Childhood Initiative'' in Pennsylvania. 
   The amendment will provide Federal funds to states to begin or expand local initiatives to provide early childhood education, parent education, and family support. Best of all, we propose to do this with no Federal mandates, and few Federal guidelines. 
   Many of our society's problems, such as the high school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, and juvenile crime can be traced in part to inadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. Increasingly, research is showing us that a child's social and intellectual development as well as a child's likelihood to become involved in these types of difficulties is deeply rooted in the early interaction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years. 
   Ultimately, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is the primary responsibility of his or her parents and family. Government cannot and should not become a substitute for parents and families, but we can help them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet the everyday challenges of parenting. 
   I believe this amendment can accomplish this and dramatically improve the life and education of millions of the youngest Americans. 
   I invite any of my colleagues, or anyone else who wants to know more about this program, to let me know because we have seen this program copied in other States, in other countries. It really can make a difference for children. I believe the support this amendment will provide for early childhood education is one of the best things we can do to assure the highest quality educational achievement for all of our children. 
   The screening for young children that goes along with it helps avoid problems and more than pays for the cost of the education programs. I believe this amendment, if we adopt it, can be a tremendous boost for children of all walks of life throughout our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of interest as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed their views on education. I particularly commend my neighbor and colleague from Kansas and my good friend from Idaho for their very perceptive comments about education. 
   As I listen to the debate back and forth, it is clear we have two very different approaches to education being championed. On the one side, we have trust of local schools; on the other side, we have mistrust. 
   On one side, we advocate local control; on the other side, they advocate Federal control. 
   On our side, we say that parents, schools, teachers, and school boards know best. On the other side, they say Washington knows best. 
   For me it is not a tough choice. This is not rocket science: trust, local control, parents, schools know best. There is no question in my mind. 
   I come to the Senate floor today to say--and I have said it before and I will say it again--I spent my adult career working with parents, teachers, and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I spent the last 13 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs. 
   When it comes to wasting money, it is not even close. It is not a contest. It is a good thing that local schools do not operate as does the Federal Government because local schools could not afford to. Luckily, schools are far better at applying resources to the needs of children in their schools. Unfortunately, the Federal bureaucracy has been good at creating waste, misdirected priorities, red tape, and unnecessary hassles and regulations. 
   As it is the case in other areas as well, our congressional zest to provide assistance has become part of the problem--our good intentions. And they are good intentions. Nobody questions the intentions. When the Congress went about creating 765 programs, every single one of them was a good idea. Unfortunately, it was at the wrong place. It was a good idea in Washington, not a good idea at the local school level. 
   Our good intentions have become burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, mounds of paperwork, and unwanted meddling. We have created a system where parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. 
   Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials, we have empowered the Federal Government and the bureaucrats. We have been slowly eroding the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have put a system in place where the Olympians on the hill pretend to know what is best for the peasants in the valley. 
   We need to be bold enough to stand up and admit that these good intentions have gone astray. Our good intentions are failing our public schools and, most importantly, they are failing our children. Let's recognize what we do not know in Washington has become obvious. Washington does not always know best, especially when it comes to micromanaging the education of children in local schools throughout this country. 
   What is wrong with giving control of education to local schools and to the States? What happened to everyone saying that education is a national priority but a local responsibility? I firmly believe that is true. If that were true, and the other side trusted those at the local level, this debate would not be as controversial as it is. 
   What is wrong with letting classroom teachers, principals, and school boards fashion plans to improve learning and achievement in their own schools? 
   Back in my home State of Missouri, no one thinks the answer to improving public education lies within the Halls of Congress or in the granite buildings in downtown Washington's Department of Education. 
   Almost everyone I have talked to will say: Stay out of the way and give the local schools the opportunity. 
   Missourians know, and I know, that the real solutions--the laboratories--are the local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not have to play the ``Mother, May I'' game with Washington, DC. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep talking about class size, afterschool programs, and numerous other programs. These will be new programs, with new mandates, and new responsibilities for schools directly controlled and regulated by Washington, smothered with reports and regulations and redtape. Is this the direction we want to go? I do not think so. This will only exacerbate the ``Mother, May I'' game. 
   As we debate ESEA today, I hope we will keep certain things in perspective. One of those things is how much money the Federal Government actually provides to the local school district and what amount of Federal involvement is appropriate with the amount of funding provided. 
   I have heard over and over again that the Federal Government provides less than 10 percent of a local school district's budget. Yet the Federal Government accounts for over 
   50 percent of the local school district's paperwork burden. How can any of us justify this proportion of Federal meddling and paperwork burden for less than 10 percent of the district's funding? In my State of Missouri, on average, Federal funding accounts for only 6 percent of the local school district's budget. 
   My great State of Missouri has some wonderful teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members--some of the best in the country. I cannot believe my colleagues are not  hearing the same thing from their constituents that I am hearing from mine. If you are not, I suggest you are not listening. Go back and ask them. They will tell you. However, just in case you have not heard, let me share some of the things I have been told. 
   The Superintendent of Springfield Public Schools in Missouri said:  
   The amount of paperwork that the federal government causes local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. That extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom time and energy that could better be spent working directly with children.  
   Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV School in Missouri said:  
   Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had in mind.  
   From Neosho R-5, in Missouri:  
   The individuals working most closely with the students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.  
   From the Superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County, MO:  
   As head of a school district specializing in special education, I fully understand how my district's financial needs differ from other school districts' needs. In order to best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those funds to the best use.  
   From the Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School District in Missouri:  
   Without local control, the focus is taken away from the needs specific to the children in each school system.  
   I think the Superintendent of the Taneyville R-II School District in Missouri sums it up well:  
   I feel that the State and Federal government has tied our school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school does this; pull it another way and the school does that. School systems and communities are as different from one another as individual people are different. What works for one will not work for another.  
   These are the types of comments I have heard over the past couple years. These comments led to the development of my Direct Check for Education proposal that is S. 52. 
   As introduced, S. 52 took six Department of Education programs, primarily competitive grant programs, and combined them and determined that the funding would go out based on average daily attendance in school districts. It would give school districts added flexibility. 
   I intend to offer an amendment that would allow us to try 
   this as a demonstration program. 
   I know it is hard sometimes to get Governors to support this concept. But I stand here as a recovering Governor. I know that Governors and States have the responsibility for welfare programs, State transportation programs; but the responsibility for directly delivering student education rests in the hands of those at the local level. 
   Let's give them the opportunity to demonstrate they can deliver. States can still establish standards and requirements. They still have the ability to control their local school districts. What I am saying, with Direct Check, is to keep their hands out of the bureaucratic maze that the Federal Government imposes on them. I hope my colleagues will take a look at that proposal when I offer it. 
   Another area I am looking at very carefully is having an amendment on Impact Aid. Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, dating from the 1950s, and is meant to compensate local school districts for the ``substantial and continuing financial burdens'' resulting from Federal activities. These ``activities'' include Federal ownership of land, such as military installations or Indian reservation lands, as well as local school enrollment of children whose parents work on Federal property. It is a Federal responsibility. 
   In my State, we have two outstanding military bases: Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base. I would argue it is a quality-of-life issue for our military and one we must address. I look forward to working on it with my colleagues. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma will be working on it. 
   I also offer my support, in advance, for an amendment I have been working on for some time with Senators STEVENS and JEFFORDS, along with a number of our other colleagues, that focuses on early childhood education and development. 
   While most of the debate this week will be about elementary and secondary education--the years of what we might call ``formal schooling''--the education and mental development of a child, however, begins long before that child enters kindergarten. In fact, the education and development of a child begins practically at birth. From the experiences we have had in Missouri with parents and teachers, we know that those first 3 years are vitally important. Giving the parents the right tools to help that child get started can make a tremendously important difference in the educational achievement of that child throughout that child's educational experience. 
   The amendment the Senators from Vermont and Alaska will offer recognizes these basic facts; that the education and mental development and entire development of a child begins early in life. Through this amendment, we hope to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood educational programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need. 
   The amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible for our Nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus on the earliest years, as well as the years of formal schooling. We can do this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and expanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working right now at the local level. I invite anybody to come to Missouri to see how well these programs work. 
   I am pleased to say the amendment is based on the basic ideas and principles set forth in legislation that I was pleased to introduce several years ago with my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY. 
   Mr. President, it is my opinion that if we want to improve our public education system to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement, we must take the stranglehold of the Federal Government off the local school districts and the States and give the resources directly to those local school districts and States so they can do their job. 
   I look forward to supporting an amendment by my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, which deals with some of the very serious problems that the current IDEA imposes. Talk to any school official, any schoolteacher, any school personnel in Missouri, and they will tell you they are scared because the requirements of IDEA put other students, teachers, and school personnel at risk from dangerously violent students who sometimes carry guns and are sheltered by the Federal regulations that come with the individual education program. We should not have a Federal Government program that puts people associated with schools at risk. We need to change the laws to protect and nurture those with IEPs but not to expose those with whom they deal to violence and perhaps even to guns. 
   In closing, we must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, and school boards because education decisions can best be made by educators, board members, parents, teachers, and local school officials who know the names and the needs of the children in their schools. I hope we will be spending our time debating education, not every issue under the Sun that may come up as an effort to derail this vitally important reform of our education system. 
   Our children deserve the reform this bill delivers. This ESEA bill deals with one of the most important national priorities, and that is education. It deals with it by moving the control and the responsibility out of Washington and back into the real world where the best decisions can be made. I look forward to working with my colleagues. 
   I thank the floor manager, the chairman of the committee, for allowing me the extra time. I look forward to continuing the debate and working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve successful ESEA reform, with perhaps some of the bells and whistles added that I have mentioned.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fishable Waters Act with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator LINCOLN. This is consensus legislation from a uniquely diverse spectrum of interests to establish a comprehensive, voluntary, incentive-based, locally-led program to improve and restore our fisheries. 
   Put simply, this legislation enables local stakeholders to get together to design water quality projects in their own areas that will be eligible for some $350 million federal assistance to implement for the benefit of our fisheries and water quality. It does not change any existing provisions, regulatory or otherwise, of the Clean Water Act. 
   The Fishable Waters Act compliments existing clean water programs that are designed to encourage, rather than coerce the participation of landowners. This legislation will work because it will empower people at the local level who have a stake in its success and who will have hands-on involvement in its implementation. 
   It is supported by members of the Fishable Waters Coalition which includes the American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the Izaak Walton League of America, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, the American Fisheries Society, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the Pacific Rivers Council. These groups have labored quietly but with great determination for several years to produce this consensus proposal to build on the success of the Clean Water Act. 
   As my colleagues understand, it is at great peril that anyone in this town undertakes to address clean water-related issues but the need is too great and this approach too practical to not embrace it, introduce it, and work to achieve the wide-spread support it merits. 
   A companion bill is being introduced by Congressman JOHN TANNER in the House. That measure is being cosponsored by Representatives ROY BLUNT, JOHN DINGELL, NANCY JOHNSON, CHARLES STENHOLM, SHERWOOD BOEHLERT, WAYNE GILCHREST, PAT DANNER, PHIL ENGLISH, CHRISTOPHER JOHN and JIM SAXTON. 
   Joining us yesterday for the kickoff were representatives of the Fisable Waters Coalition and a special guest, a fishing enthusiast who some may know otherwise as a top-ranked U.S. golfer, David Duval. ``Why am I here? I like to fish. I've done it as long as I can remember,'' Duval said. ``I want my kids to be able to have healthy habitats for fish. I want my grandkids and my great-grandkids to be able to do what I enjoy so much, and I think this could make a big difference.'' 
   This bipartisan and consensus legislation is intended to capture opportunities to build on the success of the Clean Water Act. It enables local stakeholders to get together with farmers who own 70 percent of our nation's land to design local water quality projects that will be eligible for some $350 million in federal assistance for the benefit of our fisheries and water quality. 
   Instead of Washington saying, ``you do this and you pay for it'' and instead of Washington saying, ``you do this but we'll help you pay for it'', this legislation lets local citizens design projects that can be eligible for federal assistance. For farmers, the idea of protecting land for future generations is not an abstract notion because the farmers in my State know that good stewardship is good for them and their families. Their challenge is that while they feed this nation and provide some $50 billion in exports, they do not have the ability to pass additional costs onto consumers like corporations do. For the 2 million people who farm to provide environmental benefits for themselves and the rest of the nation's 270 million people, they need partners because they cannot afford to do it by themselves. This legislation recognizes that reality. 
   While one can expect a great deal of controversy surrounding any comprehensive Clean Water effort, the consensus that has built around this approach is cause for great optimism that this legislation will be the vehicle to make significant additional progress in improving water quality. 
   I congratulate members of the Coalition for producing and supporting this consensus legislation and I look forward to working with Senator LINCOLN  and my other Senate colleagues to move this legislation forward.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of all colleagues that amendment No. 3018 is a REACH amendment. It is designed to put us on record as doubling the funding for community health centers over 5 years. These are the health facilities that reach the most poor and most needy.

   Mr. BOND. I rise today to offer an amendment that addresses what is perhaps the biggest problem we face in health care--the fact that millions of Americans can't get health care when they need it. 
   Part of this problem is cause by the fact that about 44 million Americans aren't covered by any type of health plan or health insurance. For obvious reasons, it can be difficult to get care if you don't have any insurance coverage. 
   An equally serious part of the access problem is many people's simple inability to get in to see a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a young couple with a sick child is out of luck if they can't get in to see a pediatrician. And in too many urban and rural communities across the country, there just aren't enough doctors to go around. 
   This while issue is a hot topic, and there have been a number of recent plans that address it. Some have made proposals that call for something close to a large, government takeover of our health care system--something that we soundly rejected in 1994. Others have proposed tax credits or other tax benefits to allow more people to buy into the existing market-based health care system. 
   There are clearly many differences between all of these plans, but they all have one thing in common--it will be difficult or impossible for them to become law this year. Whether because of policy differences or political differences, they're just not likely to pass. 
   So today I'm offering an amendment with strong bipartisan support--based on what I call the REACH Initiative--  that begins to address the health care access problem, and which does have a chance to pass this year. There's no need to wait--we can start this year. 
   This proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as community health centers do to provide care and ensure access for millions of Americans. 
   Heath centers are private, nonprofit clinics that provide primary care and preventive health care services in medically underserved communities across the country. They exist in every State in hundreds of rural and urban communities. Overall, there are about 750 separate centers with more than 3,000 clinics nationwide. This year, health centers will provide basic care for about 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured. 
   The goal of this amendment and of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure that even more people have access to health care. We do this by calling for a doubling in funding for community health centers over a period of 5 years, including a 1-year increase of $150 million. 
   This will ultimately allow up to 10 million more women, children, and others in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful, we can practically double the number of uninsured and underinsured people that health centers care for. 
   I am pleased that 15 other Senators have joined me as cosponsors of the REACH Initiative--the full 5-year plan. And I am ecstatic that 63 of my colleagues have agreed to join in a letter to support the $150 million increase in this coming year. 
   Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, why are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for additional funding? 
   Building on an existing program that produces results. Too many health care proposals out there suggest huge--even revolutionary--changes to our health system. While I realize that we have many problems, we must realize that many people are pleased with it despite the flaws. Instead of radical new proposals, I believe it make sense to build on an existing part of the system that's been proven to provide cost-effective, high-quality care. 
   Health centers already play an essential role. It's amazing to me how few people realize just how important community health centers are in our existing health system. Think about this--health centers provide care to close to one out of every 20 Americans--11 million people overall. In addition, health centers provide care to one out of every 12 rural residents, one out of every 6 low-income 
    children, and one of every 5 babies born to low-income families. 
   Health centers truly target the health care access problem. By definition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' communities--which simply means places where people have serious problems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the problem right at its source. 
   Relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary and preventive care for less than $1 dollar per person per day--about $350 per year. Even better, with the base federal grants, health centers are able to leverage additional private funding. This means that health centers can basically turn one federal dollar into several--all of which can be used to address the health care needs in these underserved communities. With an extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH Initiative in its fifth year--health centers could be caring for an additional 10 million people. 
   Not a government takeover of health care. While this amendment and the REACH Initiative call for some additional government spending, this is NOT a government takeover. Out of all the plans to address the health insurance and health access problem, the REACH Initiative is by far the least costly. Unlike many of the other plans, this new funding would not go to create a huge new bureaucracy. Instead, the REACH Initiative would invest additional funds into private organizations that have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective health care providers. 
   To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need for drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers are already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can still help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who desperately needs care. 
   Simply put, we need to take the goal of this amendment and of the REACH Initiative--doubled funding for health centers within 5 years--and make it happen. 
   I thank my colleagues who have taken a leadership role in support of this issue--Senator HOLLINGS; Senator HUTCHINSON; and Senator STEVENS, who I am very pleased has joined as a cosponsor of this amendment. I join with these powerful voices and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my amendment 2913 to the budget resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that no Federal funds may be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to subsidize or otherwise assist smoke shops or tobacco outlets. The amendment refers to those facilities or designated portions of facilities which focus almost exclusively on cigarette and other tobacco product sales. Free standing tobacco outlets funded by HUD in recent years devote nearly ninety percent of their in-store inventory to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Larger HUD-funded facilities containing designated tobacco stores still devote as much as eighty percent of their total in-store inventory to cigarettes or other tobacco products. These cigarette and tobacco stores stand in contrast to convenience, grocery and general discount stores where cigarette and tobacco products generally account for no more than thirty percent of total in-store sales volume. 
   The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Lung Association, American Heart Association, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society and American Academy of Pediatrics supported this amendment after agreement that HUD support of businesses that exist primarily to sell tobacco products is totally inconsistent with the Clinton Administration's efforts to curb youth smoking. The National Congress of American Indians agrees this amendment will treat Indian and non-Indian HUD grantees alike, and thus they also supported this amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment simply says the Department of HUD should stop using community development block grant funds to build discount cigarette stores known as smoke shops.  
   A year ago, a doctor called up and said there was a new discount smoke shop in his neighborhood and it was funded by Federal dollars. I didn't know what the sign said, so I sent staff out. Here it is: Smoke Shop, Discount Tobacco. Our policy is supposed to discourage cigarette smoking. Inside, we found wall-to-wall cigarettes, 25 percent or more off. These are your tax dollars at work. 
   Instead of funding what we could have funded, $4.2 million went to six of these in the last 3 years--instead of building a water tower or elders' wellness centers. 
   I wrote to HUD and said stop funding them. The letter I got back from the assistant said: You haven't proven that discount cigarettes encourage smoking. Well, it is about time we taught HUD some common sense. The Secretary of Housing now says: If you tell me to stop funding it, if you stop me from funding them, I will stop. 
   I urge colleagues to vote aye.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. It is an honor to be on the floor to join with him and Senator from Virginia to make the point very strongly that suspension or repeal of the gas tax would be a grave error. Although all of us, as Senators, are aware of consumer complaints about the high gasoline prices we are facing in our States, we also should keep in mind that this is due primarily to factors other than the level of the gas tax, as the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out. 
   Our declining production of petroleum and the constriction by OPEC of the supply of gasoline on the world markets is the most significant factor in determining the price at the pump. Cutting the tax would merely reduce the revenues available for improving highway safety without producing real savings that would be passed on to the consumers. Because of the imposition of tax at the refinery level, there is no  assurance it would come to the gasoline purchaser, the automobile owner, or the truck or bus driver. 
   The CRS has issued a report saying there might not be any appreciable evidence of a reduction in tax. The consumers would never see it. Who would see it would be those people who are committed to repairing and rebuilding our inadequate roads, bridges, and highways. 
   In 1998, I worked hard with our friend and dear colleague, the late Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee, on the Bond-Chafee guarantee that was incorporated into TEA-21 with the help of the Senators who spoke before me--Senator DOMENICI, Senator BYRD, and Senator WARNER. That provision created for the first time a real guarantee that revenues collected and earmarked for the highway trust fund would, in fact, be used for transportation purposes. If we collect a dollar gas tax, that dollar must be credited to the highway trust fund. This guarantees that for the first time highway users will get the transportation benefits in return for the user fee they pay through the gas tax. 
   We cannot have a guarantee if we continue to change the way the program is funded. To hold the trust fund harmless, supposedly by having money come from general revenue and projected surpluses, will put us back in the same sinking boat--more appropriately, crumbling highway--that we were in before. That position was one where off-budget or turnbacks were advocated. This amendment makes clear the budget resolution does not assume the reductions of any Federal gasoline tax. 
   We need a Department of Energy that makes energy policy, not the EPA. The administration policy has been no policy. We can stop the raid on the highway funds, and we must not repeal or roll back the gasoline tax.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator COLLINS to offer a bill--the Medicare Home Health Payment Act--that will address the crisis in home health care. 
   The crisis is that far too many seniors and individuals with disabilities can't get the home health care they need. They either go without needed care, or are forced into a medical facility such as a nursing home. This is a travesty, because home health can serve an extremely valuable role--it helps seniors get needed medical care while retaining the comfort and dignity of living in their own home. 
   We have plenty of data that demonstrates the problem. 
   Over 2,000 agencies driven out of business or out of the Medicare program. In Missouri alone, over 100 of the 300 agencies that were around in 1997 are gone. 
   Independent studies that show that seniors and people with disabilities just can't get access to the home care they need--perhaps forcing them into nursing homes or other medical facilities. 
   Reports that home health agencies feel forced to refuse to care for seniors because they fear the Medicare reimbursements won't cover their costs. 
   Recent news from CBO that total Medicare home health spending has actually fallen by 45 percent in just two years--perhaps the largest reduction for a specific type of provider that we have ever seen in Medicare. 
   Of course, last year I was also talking about the home health crisis--and Senator COLLINS and I had a bill to address the issue then as well. 
   But I'm here to share bad news with my colleagues--Medicare home health is still in crisis. 
   While we did address home health in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act late last year--which helped--it didn't solve everything. 
   That's because all we did last year to the biggest threat that's out there for home health care providers--the 15-percent across-the-board cuts that are in addition to all of the other cuts made thus far--was postpone things. 
   What we did not do--except for one minor provision--is increase home health reimbursement rates. Keep in mind that we did provide relief in the form of increased payments for most other Medicare providers, like hospitals and nursing facilities. 
   So what we did is simply postpone further cuts in an already-devastated industry. That cannot be the end of the story. 
   So what should we do? Senator COLLINS and I--in the bill we are introducing today with 34 of our colleagues--propose to eliminate permanently the planned 15-percent home health cuts forever. 
   I think this initial show of support form my colleagues is tremendous--and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure this bill becomes law. The millions of Americans on Medicare--for whom the home health benefit is so important--deserve no less.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in the House, Congressmen BLILEY and OBERSTAR and 42 other House Members, as well as Senators LANDRIEU, CRAIG, JEFFORDS, LINCOLN, JOHNSON, LIEBERMAN, JEFFORDS, ROBB, STEVENS, and WARNER, in introducing a bill to reimburse all federal employees up to $2,000 for qualified expenses associated with the adoption of a child and for special-needs adoptions--the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000. 
   Every year, couples who are unable to have children of their own spend literally thousands of dollars to adopt a child. Statistics show that approximately 2.1 million couples in the Unites States are infertile. One of the main reasons for this is because couples are waiting longer to start a family in order to focus on careers. Many seek treatment to conceive a child, but are unsuccessful. For them, their only hope of having a child of their own is through adoption. 
   The adoption process demands an incredible amount of time and money and creates stress that can affect job performance. For this reason many private-sector businesses, such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Sprint, Prudential, Home Depot, and Freddie Mac, now provide financial assistance to employees adopting a child, thus increasing employee satisfaction, productivity, and loyalty and commitment to the employer. Unfortunately, the largest employer in the U.S.--the federal government--currently provides no financial assistance for adoption expenses to its employees. That is why I am introducing the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act. 
   This legislation would allow federal agencies to reimburse employees up to $2,000 for all qualified expenses associated with the adoption of a child, including special-needs children. Any benefit paid by this legislation would come out of funds available for salaries and expenses of the relevant agencies. Currently, active-duty armed services personnel receive this adoption benefit, $2,000 per adoption; however, no other branch of the federal government covers this expense. 
   A key aspect of adoption that is frequently overlooked, and that I have made sure is addressed in this legislation, is that of special-needs children. Recent estimates show there are currently around 110,000 special-needs children in foster care who are eligible for adoption. Many of these children have physical or mental disabilities and need extensive care and therapy. Another common situation is two or more siblings in need of a family willing to take on the responsibility of more than one child. Most of these children are currently in foster care waiting to find a permanent home and family of their own, and are less likely to be adopted than non-special-needs children. 
   Often, couples who may already have children of their own are interested in opening their home and their hearts to adopt a child or children with special needs, but are hesitant to do so due to the costs involved. By providing an adoption reimbursement benefit, many couples already considering adopting special-needs children decide to go ahead with the process. The Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act broadens the adoption benefits package to include the costs associated with special-needs adoptions. 
   Mr. President, this is why I, along with numerous colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers, are introducing and advocating the passage of this legislation. Additionally, this bipartisan and bicameral bill has the endorsement of numerous adoption advocacy groups, including: 
   Bethany Christian Services in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Covenant House, The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, The Edgewood Children's Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Family Voices, The National Adoption Center, The National Council for Adoption, The National Treasury Employees Union, and Voice for Adoption. 
   As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I believe we should provide incentives to make sure that more children find loving parents. I thank my colleagues, Senators LANDRIEU, CRAIG, JEFFORDS, LINCOLN, JOHNSON, LIEBERMAN, JEFFORDS, ROBB, STEVENS, and WARNER, Congressmen BLILEY and OBERSTAR, and the numerous other House and Senate sponsors, as well as the many adoption advocacy groups, for joining me in promoting adoption and supporting our civil servants by cosponsoring and endorsing this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that addresses an issue of growing concern to small businesses across the nation--tax accounting methods. And I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. 
   While this topic may lack the notoriety of some other tax issues currently in the spotlight like the estate tax or alternative minimum tax, it goes to the heart of a business' daily operations--reflecting its income and expenses. And because it is such a fundamental issue, one may ask: ``What's the big deal?'' Hasn't this been settled long ago?'' Regrettably, recent efforts by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have muddied what many small business owners have long seen as a settled issue. 
   To many small business owners, tax accounting simply means that they record cash receipts when they come in and the cash they pay when they write a check for a business expense. The difference is income, which is subject to taxes. In its simplest form, this is known as the ``cash receipts and disbursements'' method of accounting--or the ``cash method'' for short. It is easy to understand, it is simple to undertake in daily business operations, and for the vast majority of small enterprises, it matches their income with the related expenses in a given year. Coincidentally, it's also the method of accounting used by the Federal Government to keep track of the $1.7 trillion in tax revenues it collects each year as well as all of its expenditures for salaries and expenses, procurement, and the cost of various government programs. 
   Unfortunately, the IRS has taken a different view in recent years with respect to small businesses on the cash method. In too many cases, the IRS contends that a small business should report its income when all events have occurred to establish the business' right to receipt and the amount can reasonably be determined. Similar principles are applied to determine when a business may recognize an expense. This method of accounting is known as ``accrual accounting.'' The reality of accrual accounting for a small business is that it may be  deemed to have income well before the cash is actually received and an expense long after the cash is actually paid. As a result, accrual accounting can create taxable income for a small business that has yet to receive the cash necessary to pay the taxes. 
   While the IRS argues that the accrual method of accounting produces a more accurate reflection of ``economic income,'' it also produces a major headache for small enterprise. Few entrepreneurs have the time or experience to undertake accrual accounting, which forces them to hire costly accountants and tax preparers. By some estimates, accounting fees can increase as much as 50% when accrual accounting is required, excluding the cost of high-tech computerized accounting systems that some businesses must install. For the brave few that try to handle the accounting on their own, the accrual method often leads to major mistakes, resulting in tax audits and additional costs for professional help to sort the whole mess out--not to mention the interest and penalties that the IRS may impose as a result of the mistake. 
   To make matters even worse, the IRS recently began focusing on small service providers who use some merchandise in the performance of their service. In an e-mail sent to practitioners in my State of Missouri and in Kansas, the IRS' local district office took special aim at the construction industry asserting that ``[t]axpayers in the construction industry who are on the cash method of accounting may be using an improper method. The cash method is permissible only if materials are not an income producing factor.'' For these lucky service providers, the IRS now asserts that the use of merchandise requires the business to undertake an additional and even more onerous form of bookkeeping--inventory accounting. 
   Let's be clear about the kind of taxpayer at issue here. It's the home builder who by necessity must purchase wood, nails, dry wall, and host of other items to provide the service of constructing a house. Similarly, it's a painting contractor who will often purchase the paint when she renders the service of painting the interior of a house. These service providers generally purchase materials to undertake a specific project and at its end, little or no merchandise remains. They may even arrange for the products to be delivered directly to their client. In either case, the IRS insists that inventory accounting is now required. 
   Mr. President, if we thought that accrual accounting is complicated and burdensome, imagining in having to keep track of all the boards, nails, and paint used in the home builder's and painter's jobs each year. And the IRS doesn't stop at inventory accounting for these service providers. Instead, they use it as the first step to imposing overall accrual accounting--a one-two punch for the small service provider when it comes to compliance burdens. 
   Even more troubling is the cost of an audit for these unsuspecting service providers who have never known they were required to use inventories or accrual accounting. According to a survey of practitioners by the Padgett Business Services Foundation, audits of businesses on the issue of merchandise used in the performance of services resulted in tax deficiencies from $2,000 to $14,000, with an average of $7,200. That's a pretty steep price to pay for an accounting method error that the IRS has for years never enforced. 
   In many cases, like retailing, inventory accounting makes sense. Purchasing or manufacturing products and subsequently selling them is the heart of a retail business, and keeping track of those products is a necessary reality. But for a service provider with incidental merchandise, like a roofing contractor, inventory accounting is nothing short of an unnecessary government-imposed compliance cost. 
   The bill I'm introducing today, the Small Business Tax Accounting Simplification Act of 2000, addresses both of these issues. First, it establishes a clear threshold for when small businesses may use the cash method of accounting. Simply put, if a business has an average of $5 million in annual gross receipts or less during the preceding three years, it may use the cash method. Plain and simple--no complicated formula; no guessing if you made the right assumptions and arrived at the right answer. If the business exceeds the threshold, it may still seek to establish, as under current law, that the cash method clearly reflects its income. 
   Some may argue that this provision is unnecessary because section 448(b) and (c) already provide a $5 million gross receipts test with respect to accrual accounting. That's a reasonable position since many in Congress back in 1986 intended section 448 to provide relief for small business taxpayers using the cash method. Unfortunately, the IRS has twisted this section to support its quest to force as many small businesses as possible into costly accrual accounting. The IRS construes section 448 as merely a $5 million ceiling above which a business can never use the cash method. My bill corrects this misinterpretation once and for all--if a business has average gross receipts of $5 million or less, it is free to use cash accounting. 
   Second, for small service providers, the Small Business Tax Accounting Simplification Act, creates a straightforward threshold for inventory accounting. If the amount paid for merchandise by a small service provider is less than 50% of its gross receipts, based on its prior year's figures, no inventory accounting would be required. Above that level, the taxpayer would look more like a retail business and inventory accounting may make sense. 
   These two thresholds set forth in my bill are common sense answers to an increasing burden for small businesses in this country. In addition, it sends a clear signal to the IRS: stop wasting scarce resources forcing small businesses to adopt complex and costly accounting methods when the benefit to the Treasury is simply a matter of timing. Whether a small business uses the cash or accrual method or inventory accounting or not, in the end, the government will still collect the same amount of taxes--maybe not all this year, but very likely early in the next year. What small business can go very long without collecting what it is owed or paying its bills? 
   To date, the Treasury Department's answer has been to suggest a $1 million threshold under which a small business could escape accrual accounting and presumably inventories. While it is a step in the right direction, it simply doesn't go far enough. Even ignoring inflation, if a million dollar threshold were sufficient, why would Congress have tried to enact a $5 million threshold 14 years ago? My bill completes the job that the Treasury Department has been unable or unwilling to do. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is substantially similar to the bill introduced in the other body by my good friend and fellow Missourian, JIM TALENT (H.R. 2273). With the strong support he has built among his colleagues in the other chamber and in the small business community, I expect to continue the momentum in the Senate and achieve some much needed relief from unnecessary compliance burdens and costs for America's small businesses. 
   The call for tax simplification has been growing increasingly loud in recent years, and the bill I offer today provides an excellent opportunity for us to advance the ball well down the field. This is not a partisan issue; it's a small business issue. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this common sense legislation for the benefit of America's small enterprises, which contribute so greatly to this country's economic engine. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a copy of the bill and a description of its provisions.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to extend my heartfelt sympathies to the family of 6-year-old Jake D. Robel of Blue Springs, Missouri. 
   One week ago Jake died after being dragged for almost five miles at high speed by a man who had stolen Jake's mother's car in Independence, Missouri. 
   Jake's mom had stopped at a sandwich shop to run in and pick up her order. She left her car running and Jake was waiting in the car. 
   This town and area should be safe. Many would say tragedies like this one happen everywhere else, but not here. In this area, there are people who always leave their car doors unlocked and their keys in the ignition. Many leave their homes unlocked and have no idea where to find the house key. 
   Unfortunately, that sense of security is now shattered. 
   In those few moments it took Jake's mom to run into the sandwich shop, an assailant jumped in her vehicle and sped away. Jake, with his mother's help, tried to escape from the vehicle, but became entangled in the seat belt. In a heartbeat, the car door closed--with Jake tangled in the seat belt--being dragged behind. 
   I can't imagine the loss felt by the family and friends of Jake Robel. However, I want to join with the countless families in Missouri and across the nation in sending my thoughts and prayers to those in grief. 
   Mr. President, in addition, it is important to recognize the bravery, heroism, and citizenship of those that tried to come to Jake's rescue. 
   The man who stole the car took off on Interstate 70 at high speed. All along the way, people honked and shouted from their cars for him to stop. The driver was stopped and apprehended, not by the police, but by approximately four gentlemen who managed to surround the vehicle after the man left I-70 and turned onto a busy street in Independence, Missouri. The man tried to escape on foot, but was stopped by these heroes who tied his feet together and sat on him until the police arrived. These men acted swiftly and responsibly. 
   Once again, Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Jake Robel as well as to all those who witnessed such a tragedy. I also want to recognize the gentlemen who apprehended the driver. These honorable citizens have shown us first-hand that heroes do exist.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of the hot topics in the world of health care--health care access. Many people see this as the biggest problem in health care today. 
   Part of the problem, and the part that has received the most attention, is that too many Americans lack health insurance--about 44 million Americans are not covered by any type of health plan. But an equally serious part of the problem is many people's simple inability to get access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a young couple with a sick child is out of luck if they cannot get in to see a pediatrician or another health care provider. And in too many urban and rural communities across the country, there just are not enough doctors to go around. 
   Several plans have been proposed recently on how to deal with the health care access problem. Senator Bradley has a plan. The Vice President has one. There's also a bipartisan proposal for tax credits to help people buy health insurance. All of these plans have at least three things in common: 
   First, they all address a worthwhile goal. I think we all want to see that people have access to good health care, even if we might disagree on how to get there. 
   Second, they are all very ambitious. Senator Bradley in fact is basically proposing to use close to the entire $1 trillion surplus to provide people with health insurance. 
   The third thing these plans have in common--and perhaps the most important thing--is that it will be difficult or impossible for them to become law this year. Whether because of policy differences or political differences, it is just not likely that they will pass. 
   So last week, we launched a bipartisan effort--along with Senators HOLLINGS, COCHRAN, LINCOLN, HATCH, HUTCHINSON of Arkansas, I and other Senators--called the REACH Initiative, that does have a chance this year. There is no need to wait for an election, we can do it now. 
   Our proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as community health centers have been doing to ensure better access to health care. Health centers are private nonprofit clinics that provide primary care and preventive health care services in medically-underserved urban and rural communities across the country. Partially with the help of Federal grants, health centers provide basic care for about 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured. 
   The goal of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure more people have access to health care. We plan to achieve this by doubling Federal funding for community health centers over a period of 5 years. We believe this will allow up to 10 million more women, children, and others in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful with the REACH Initiative, we can practically double the number of uninsured and underinsured people cared for at health centers. 
   I am pleased that 12 colleagues--led by my good friend from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS--have joined me to introduce this resolution calling for doubled health center funding over 5 years.  
   The REACH Initiative basically recognizes the key contributions that community health centers have already made in addressing the health care access problems. But there is so much more that can still be one. 
   Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, why are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for additional funding? 
   No. 1, they are building on an existing program that produces results. Too many health care proposals want to start practically from scratch, and make breathtakingly revolutionary changes. When I look at the health system and its admittedly huge problems, I sometimes think that might not be a bad idea. But it is also extremely risky. We need to remember that despite the many flaws in our health system, many people are pleased with it. We should be wary about making too radical changes that could interfere with what is right in our system. Instead, we can expand an existing part of the system that has been proven to provide cost-effective, high-quality care. 
   No. 2, health centers play a crucial role in health care, and are vastly underappreciated. It is amazing to me how few people know what community health centers are. After all, health centers care for close to one out of every 20 Americans, one out of every 12 rural residents, one out of every 6 low-income children, and one of every 5 babies born to low-income families. 
   No. 3, health centers truly target the health care access problem. By definition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' communities--which simply means places where people have serious problems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the problem right at its source. Unlike other health care proposals, the REACH Initiative does not create problems of ``crowding out'' private insurance by replacing private dollars spent on health insurance with Federal dollars. The health centers are partially funded by those patients who do have health insurance. 
   No. 4, they are relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary and preventive care for one person for less than $1 per day--about $350 per year. That's just about the best value you will ever see in health care. Even better, health centers are able to leverage each grant dollar from the Federal Government into additional funding from other sources--meaning they can effectively turn one grant dollar into several dollars that can be used to address health care problems. With an extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH Initiative in its fifth year--health centers could be caring for an additional 10 million people. 
   No. 5, this initiative is not a government takeover of health care. Admittedly, our plan calls for more government spending. This is of course true for most plans that try to deal with health access problems. But this new funding would not go to create a huge new bureaucracy. Instead, the REACH Initiative would invest additional funds into private organizations that have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective health care providers. 
   To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need for drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers are already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can still help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who desperately needs care. 
   Simply put, we must reach the goal of the REACH initiative--doubled funding for health care centers within 5 years--and we can and should make it happen. 
   Let me close with what this means in human terms. 
   The REACH initiative will help make sure that a young woman who has just found out she is pregnant but does not have health insurance has a place to get prenatal care so she does not risk her health and the baby's health by waiting until late in the pregnancy. 
   The REACH initiative will help make sure that a 6-year-old boy who is living in a deep rural Missouri community, a community that otherwise would not have any health care providers at all, has a place to get regular checkups so he can stay healthy at home and in school. 
   The REACH initiative will help make sure a young couple without anyplace to go will be able to get their infant daughter immunized to protect her from a variety of dreaded diseases. 
   The REACH initiative will make sure Americans like Denise Hall, a Washington, DC, resident, and her children have a place to get needed care. Denise joined us for our announcement last week and talked about her reliance on health care centers. The REACH initiative will make sure she and her children have a place to get needed care. Denise, at our press conference kicking off the REACH initiative, said she is an out-of-work mother of two who is working to improve her job skills so she can rejoin the workforce. But for the moment, she and her children simply have nowhere to go for health care needs other than a local community health center. 
   These Americans, and millions like them, are the reasons why we must make the REACH initiative--doubled funding for community health centers--become a reality. I invite my colleagues to join me and 12 others who cosponsored this resolution, and 29 distinguished health care organizations, in support of the REACH initiative. If we work together, we can make a difference and serve those who are in the greatest need of access to health care and who, without community health centers, will not have that access. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the hot topic in the world of health care--health care access. Many people see this as the biggest problem in health care today. 
   Part of the problem, and the part that has received the most attention, is that too many Americans lack health insurance--about 44 million Americans aren't covered by any type of health plan. But an equally serious part of the problem is many people's simple inability to get access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a young couple with a sick child is out of luck if they can't get in to see a pediatrician or another health care provider. And in too many urban and rural communities across the country, there just aren't enough doctors to go around. 
   Several plans have been proposed recently on how to deal with the health care access problem. Senator Bradley has a plan. The Vice President has one. There's also a bipartisan proposal for tax credits to help people buy health insurance. All of these plans have at least 3 things in common. 
   First, they all address a worthwhile goal. I think we all want to see that people have access to good health care, even if we might disagree on how to get there. 
   Second, they're all very ambitious. Senator Bradley in fact is basically proposing to use close to the entire $1 trillion surplus to provide people with health insurance. 
   The third thing these plans have in common--and perhaps the most important thing--is that they probably have little chance of becoming law this year. Whether because of policy differences or political differences, it's just not likely that they will pass. 
   So today, we're launching a bipartisan effort--called the REACH Initiative--that does have a chance this year. There's no need to wait for an election--we can do it now. 
   Our proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as community health centers have been doing to ensure better access to health care. Health centers are private nonprofit clinics that provide primary care and preventive health care services in medically-underserved urban and rural communities across the country. Partially with the help of federal grants, health centers provide basic care for about 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured. 
   The goal of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure more people have access to health care. We plan to achieve this by doubling federal funding for community health centers over a period of five years. We believe this will allow up to 10 million more women, children, and others in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful with the REACH Initiative, we can practically double the number of uninsured and underinsured people that health centers care for. 
   The REACH Initiative basically recognizes the key contributions that community health centers have already made in addressing the health care access problems. But there is so much more that can still be done. 
   Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, why are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for additional funding? 
   1. Health centers are an existing program that produces results. Too many health care proposals want to practically start from scratch, and make breathtakingly revolutionary changes. When I look at the health system and its admittedly huge problems, I sometimes think that might not be a bad idea. But it's also extremely risky. We need to remember that despite the many flaws in our health system, many people are pleased with it. We should be wary about making too radical changes that could interfere with what's right in our system. Instead, we can expand an existing part of the system that's been proven to provide cost-effective, high-quality care. 
   2. Health centers play a crucial role in health care, and are vastly underappreciated. It's amazing to me how few people are aware of the types of services community health centers provide, and just how prominent they are in health care. After all, health centers care for close to one out of very 20 Americans, one out of every 12 rural  residents, one out of every 6 low-income children, and one of every 5 babies born to low-income families. 
   3. Health centers truly target the health care access problem. By definition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' communities--which simply means places where people have serious problems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the problem right at this source. Unlike 
   other health care proposals, the REACH Initiative doesn't create problems of ``crowding out'' private insurance by replacing private dollars spent on health insurance with federal dollars. 
   4. Health centers are relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary and preventive care for one person for less than $1 dollar per day--about $350 per year. Even better, health centers are able to leverage each grant dollar from the federal government into additional funding from other sources--meaning they can effectively turn one grant dollar into several dollars that can be used to address health care problems. With an extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH Initiative in its fifth year--health centers could be caring for an additional 10 million people. 
   5. Expanding health center access would not be a government takeover of health care. New funding within the REACH Initiative. But this new funding would not go to create a huge new government bureaucracy. Instead, the REACH Initiative would invest additional funds in private organizations that have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective health care providers. 
   To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need for drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers are already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can still help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who desperately needs care. 
   At the start of my remarks, I said that we were here to talk about and address the problem of health care access--but that's sort of a cold way to talk about it. So let me try again, but this time in human terms. 
   We're here to introduce the REACH Initiative to make sure that a young woman who has just found out she's pregnant--but who doesn't have health insurance--has a place to get prenatal care so she doesn't risk her health and her baby's health by waiting until late in the pregnancy. 
   We're here to introduce the REACH Initiative to make sure that a 6-year-old boy living in a heavily rural Missouri community--where there wouldn't otherwise be any health care providers at all--has a place to get regular checkups so he can stay health at home and in school. 
   We're here to make sure that a young couple without anywhere else to go has a place to get their infant daughter immunized to protect her from a variety of dreaded diseases. 
   These individuals, and millions more like them, are the reasons why we must make the goal of the REACH Initiative--doubled funding for community health centers--a reality.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of Dr. Richard Harriman. Dr. Harriman has been an integral part of the Fine Arts program at William Jewell College and on February 25, 2000, the Fine Arts program will be named for him. 
   Among his many accomplishments, Dr. Harriman presented the world professional recital debut by the world renowned Luciano Pavarotti in 1973. Dr. Harriman has also presented other artists such as Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma. 
   The Fine Arts program at William Jewell Incorporates an Education Series that offers free masters classes, workshops and discussions allowing Jewell students and community members to view artists in a less formal setting. Furthermore, the program was named in Peterson's Smart Parents Guide to College as an example of how small colleges can become centers of culture for an entire region. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Harriman has been a tremendous asset to William Jewell College and, indeed, the entire Kansas City area. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating him on this most distinguished honor.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at the news of the passing of one of the finest defensive football players ever, Derrick Thomas. 
   Derrick Thomas had a stellar 11 year career, all of which was spent with the Kansas City Chiefs. Among his numerous NFL achievements are 9 Pro Bowl appearances, 119.5 sacks, 3 safeties, and 28 fumble recoveries; all of which are K.C. records. In 1990, Derrick had 20 sacks in one season, setting a K.C. single season record. 
   When Derrick was just 5 years old, his father was shot down over Vietnam on December 17, 1972. He was returning from a mission called ``Operation Linebacker Two.'' As you can imagine, this had a tremendous impact on young Derrick. Eighteen years later, Derrick was the most dominant linebacker in the National Football League. His most impressive performance came against the Seattle Seahawks when he made a NFL record 7 sacks in one game. As fate would have it, that game was on Veteran's Day. 
   Mr. President, while he certainly made an impact on the quarterbacks that played against him, he made a much larger impact in the lives of those he touched through his philanthropic efforts. During his career he received the League's two most prestigious humanitarian awards. In 1993 he was the youngest man to ever win the NFL Man of the Year and in 1995 he won the Byron ``Whizzer'' White Humanitarian Award for service to team, community and country. The Humanitarian Award is the most prestigious award given by the NFL Players Association. 
   In 1993 he delivered the keynote address at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial during the annual Memorial Day ceremony. By delivering the Keynote address, he joined the ranks of other great Americans such as Bob Hope and General Colin Powell. Derrick said addressing those who served with his father was one of his greatest honors. 
   By far, his greatest contribution was founding the Third and Long Foundation. The foundation's goal is to help inner-city children by ``sacking illiteracy.'' As part of the program, Derrick would read to children at local libraries each home Saturday during the season. President Bush designated Derrick as the 832nd point of light for his work with the foundation. Derrick said once that he didn't want to be remembered or rewarded for what he did in football, but that if he helped one child become a success, that is all he needed. Derrick has been and will continue to be a force in the lives of many children through the work of his foundation. 
   Derrick Thomas was truly a humanitarian, philanthropist and hero, not only to Kansas City, but to many around the country. His life was tragically cut short at the age of 33, but his influence will continue to make America better for the youth of this country for many years to come. Thank you, Derrick.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee for giving me the opportunity to make these remarks. I hope our colleagues are listening to his remarks. As a former economics professor, he has been able to bring to common terms, in understandable language, the message that is so important in economics. 
   I have stayed awake longer listening to his treatises on economics than I have on most of the ones I had in school. While the record is not perfect, at least it is better. We appreciate his kind words. 
   I also thank my colleague from Iowa for permitting me to make these remarks. 
   Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the nomination of Alan Greenspan for his fourth term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
   As has just been said, since Chairman Greenspan was originally appointed in 1987, his wise stewardship of the monetary policy of this country has in no small part contributed to the best economic times in our country's history. 
   Yesterday we reached a milestone of economic expansion. Our country has a record 107 consecutive months of economic growth. At no other time in our history have we experienced uninterrupted economic growth that has lasted this long. Moreover, it does not appear that this growth is slowing. Unemployment is at record lows. Consumer confidence is at record highs. Inflation, the unfortunate byproduct of expansion in the past, has been kept under control. 
   Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have raised questions about the way Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have conducted their business. Make no mistake--it is an arcane science. Maybe it is an art. I am never sure whether it is an art or a science. Make no mistake about the fact that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Board itself have tremendous power in this economy. It can cause inflation or it can foster low inflation. It can promote sound economic growth or it can cause a depression. As tough as that job is--and probably none of us here in this body would fully understand it--fortunately, we have a means of judging the  success of the work that is done by the Chairman and by the Federal Reserve. In no place can I think of a better application for the admonition that you shall be judged by your works or, as we say at home in Missouri and in the country: Show me. Don't tell me what you are going to do; show me what you have done. Under that test, Alan Greenspan has received the highest marks. 
   When you look at what has happened, more people are working. More people can buy homes. More people can keep their jobs. And they can see that their savings are not eroded by inflation. 
   It was only about 20 years ago we saw inflation destroying savings and driving the price of homes out of reach of almost every American--a tremendous crisis--because monetary policy had gotten out of control. Today we see monetary policy under control; we see growth; we see opportunity. All American citizens stand to benefit from this growth, and I think they owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated public service of Chairman Greenspan. 
   Many economists did not believe low unemployment and low inflation could exist for a significant period of time. Indeed, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have cited the fact that even Chairman Greenspan has learned as he has gone along. As he stated in his remarks, he has seen that there is a new paradigm. There is a new operation in effect. Times have changed, and we are learning more about economics. 
   But as we learn more about them and how monetary policy affects our country, the Chairman's firm hand on the rudder of 
   economic policy has been responsible for keeping us on the straight and steady course. He wisely steered America clear of the potential harm that may have resulted from the Asian financial crisis and, as the chairman of the Banking Committee said, the other crises back through the savings and loan debacle. 
   In addition, he has provided unwavering support for fiscally conservative budgetary policy and has been of enormous assistance to this body. He explained to us even recently, as he probably well needed to, the necessity of continuing to link sound monetary and sound fiscal policy. I believe if you translate what he said in his speech, it was: Don't blow the surplus on big spending programs. That is an important message for us. 
   As we look to the future, we see that the near-term economic future of this country looks promising. There are clearly--and we all recognize it--dangers to our prosperity that will likely arise, including inflation fears, increasing labor costs, dampening market problems, and structural problems in the economy. But Chairman Greenspan's thoughtful leadership over the last 12 years will serve us well in the coming years. 
   I am very proud to add my name in support of Alan Greenspan for another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I congratulate and I thank President Clinton for nominating him because I think not only we as a country are grateful that he has agreed to accept a fourth term but we will all benefit from his service in that term. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support his nomination. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Iowa.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the passing of a wonderful woman and a great American. On the 21st of January, at the age of 101, Mrs. Jean MacArthur passed away at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. 
   In 1988, President Reagan recognized her contribution to America by presenting her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As you know, the Medal of Freedom is the highest award our country can give to a civilian. The citation for the award recognized that ``Jean MacArthur has witnessed the great cataclysms of our time, survived war and peace, conquered tragedy and known triumph.'' President Reagan  also referred to her as ``a shining example, a woman of substance and character, a loyal wife and mother, and like her General, a patriot.'' 
   The General and Mrs. MacArthur were married in 1937. Mrs. MacArthur remained devoted to her husband until his death in 1964. Her devotion to him was not only emotional, but involved a great deal of physical sacrifice. You see, Mr. President, Mrs. MacArthur lived with the General in Manila until they were forced to retreat to Corregidor by the Japanese. While on Corregidor, she endured daily air attacks while raising their 4 year old son, Arthur. Furthermore, when it was obvious the Japanese would take the Philippines, the president of the Philippines offered passage for her and her son to Australia. She replied: ``We have drunk from the same cup; we three shall stay together.'' She then continued to stay with her husband in the field until General MacArthur finally accepted the surrender of the Japanese in Japan. 
   After the death of General MacArthur, Mrs. MacArthur lived out her life in New York where she remained active in philanthropic activities. She even served as the honorary chairman of the MacArthur Foundation, which was created in honor of her husband. 
   The spouses of our Americans in uniform seldom receive the recognition they deserve for their contribution to the valor, patriotism, and loyalty of our fighting forces. Her contribution to America cannot be quantified, but it must not be forgotten. It's no wonder that General MacArthur often introduced her as ``my finest soldier.'' 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute to this outstanding woman and her sterling contribution to America.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, On January 30th, the St. Louis Rams faced the  Tennessee Titans in one of the most spectacular Super Bowls ever. Both teams played valiantly, and in the end, the Rams were triumphant. 
   The Rams' victory in Super Bowl XXXIV was the only fitting ending for a season that one expects to find in a movie script. From day one, the Rams' motto was ``Gotta Go To Work.'' Embracing that attitude, the Rams posted one of the best seasons ever. Quarterback Kurt Warner, the regular season and Super Bowl MVP, came from bagging groceries and playing in the arena football league to lead his team to the most coveted prize in football. He became only the second man ever to throw 40 or more touchdown passes in one season. Runningback Marshall Faulk set a new record for total yards from scrimmage. The offense scored 526 points, the third highest total ever. Head Coach Dick Vermeil was named the NFL's coach of the year. Six Rams were chosen to start in the Pro Bowl. The team's defense was top rated in the NFL against the run. 
   Perhaps even more impressive than the Rams' regular season was their performance in the Super Bowl. The Rams, living their slogan ``Gotta Go To Work,'' played like a team possessed. Warner set a new Super Bowl record with 414 yards passing. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce caught a 73-yard touchdown pass. Wide receiver Torry Holt set a rookie record with 7 catches for 109 yards--and a touchdown. The defense, led by defensive end Kevin Carter and linebacker London Fletcher, never yielded for a moment. When their backs were up against the wall, linebacker Mike Jones heroically tackled the Tennessee Titan's wide receiver Kevin Dyson to seal the victory. 
   My congratulations go out to the Rams players, the coaching staff, and the loyal St. Louis fans, who have supported the Rams in anticipation of this moment. 
   The spirit of the St. Louis Rams provides an example for St. Louis, and all of America, of how to live and work. I commend Kurt Warner, Isaac Bruce, Mike Jones and all of the Rams for the sense of unity and pride they have brought to St. Louis.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the bill. 
   I rise today because I feel very strongly about what we are considering. Today we in the Congress are being asked to consider our first statement on Indonesia since the country's elections last fall. Everyone is familiar with it. Everyone has watched CNN and watched the bloodshed and horror that occurred in East Timor and other places in Indonesia. That was prior to the Indonesian elections, and it had taken place under a severely weakened and ineffective leader. 
   Last fall, the Parliament completed the first election cycle that was truly free in the country's history by electing a new President, President Abdurrahman Wahid. I just returned from Indonesia, where I not only met with President Wahid but the Vice President, the Foreign Minister, the Speaker, and the Head of Parliament. I met with Indonesian citizens, Americans living over there, and most important of all, I met with our very astute and very able Ambassador, Bob Gelbard, and the staff we have in Indonesia to help us formulate policy with respect to that country. 
   Unfortunately, our press, which gave us a lot of information about East Timor, has not paid much attention to the free elections. It has paid little attention to the work of the new Government and its efforts to lead a transition to democracy. This is truly a time of rapid change in Indonesia, and it is a time of great challenge for Indonesian leadership and others in the world who support democracy, freedom, human rights, civilian control of the military, and religious tolerance for all people. 
   Regretfully, some Members of this body seem determined to stay in the past. Things are moving in the right direction, and it is time, in my view, for the United States to support the new Government, to work to make sure that this Government succeeds, and that the noble objectives we support are carried out. 
   President Wahid's job in this situation could not be more difficult. He has to bring democracy and a better standard of living to people who were living under a totalitarian government in a situation that bordered on chaos. He has to bring under control the ethnic and religious conflicts that are breaking out all over the country. Perhaps most difficult of all, he has to overcome the well-entrenched and powerful interests that want him to fail, that would be delighted to bring the country straight back into chaos. 
   From everything I saw, and from what our distinguished Ambassador and his staff tell us, President Wahid has not disappointed. He wakes up every day and makes bold and courageous decisions and he doesn't bother to take polls on what people want. He is simply concerned about moving his country in the right direction. 
   I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome President Wahid to Washington, DC, and to give him an opportunity to address the Congress to talk about the challenges he faces and his commitment to the American ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights, and cleaning up corruption in all areas of government and private sector activity. 
   In a very short time, the changes in Indonesia have been marked and profound. On the issues the sponsors of this amendment are concerned about, President Wahid has agreed to work with the U.N. Security Council to track down and bring to justice those who were responsible for the bloodshed in East Timor. The Indonesian Government, as has been noted already, has impaneled their own commission to investigate what took place in East Timor and bring those to justice. The panel has identified six high-ranking military officers. The President has indicated they will all be removed from the military and has given every indication they will be brought to justice. 
   When the spokesman for the military said the military should not be subject to the control of the civilian-elected Government, the President moved and cut him off. We in Congress cannot 
   continue to put our heads in the sand with these monumental changes going forward. Even the European Union recognizes the tremendous progress President Wahid and his Government are making. The E.U. has lifted the ban on certain arms sales. They pledged to begin military training. 
   I regret to tell you the situation in Indonesia and East Timor is not as simple as some of my colleagues would have you believe. Secretary Cohen traveled there and laid out what we expect of the new Government. The Government has complied, but in the interim we have cut off our ability to have any positive influence by ending military to military contact. I say let's listen to our former colleague, now Defense Secretary Bill Cohen, who is well informed about what is going on in that area. I suggest we listen to the people in our State Department--a State Department run by the party of my colleagues who have introduced this resolution--and ask them what we can do to help move the Government, move the cause of democracy and freedom, in the right direction. At a time such as this, we should be sending to the people of Indonesia a loud message,  and a clear message, that we support their efforts to achieve democracy and we will support the new Government in its efforts to bring democracy to its 210 million people. 
   The resolution, as I have just seen it, as I quickly calculate, dedicates 14 lines to congratulating the people of Indonesia and encouraging the Government of this country to work with the struggling democracy and then dedicates several pages to those things we as a government should be denying the Indonesian Government. Here is a country emerging from all the problems of the past. They need a hand up, not another bucket of water dumped on their heads. 
   Secretary Cohen delivered a clear message during his trip to the country that it was time for military reform. The Indonesian people responded. Today, the Indonesian military is under civilian control. In a clear move to curb the power of the army, the position of commander in chief has been given to an admiral in the Indonesian Navy, considered to be the most progressive and professional of the military branches. Under pressure from Secretary Cohen, the military vacated East Timor. There have been positive reports coming in that the military has been cooperating with the international community. Some members are working actively to frustrate the efforts of pro-Jakarta militias to conduct any further raids on refugees or East Timor towns. 
   On the human rights front, a new attorney general has been selected. Our State Department has great confidence in his commitment to the rule of law and protection of human rights. The Indonesian Government has also created a new position within the Government, the State Commission on Human Rights, a position that has been filled by a former political prisoner from Aceh. 
   These are not insignificant steps. In fact, they are enormous steps that show the tremendous effort on the part of the new Government and the people of Indonesia. 
   The outcome of the election could have been very different. It was not. There was no mass violence in the streets, and there was no military coup. The result was democracy in action. 
   The bottom line is the Indonesians have been doing everything we asked them to do. Now, with this proposed resolution, we are being urged not to offer congratulations, not to extend a helping hand but, rather, to poke a sharp stick in their eye. 
   This resolution endorses a cutoff of military-to-military contact, education, and military assistance. But the administration promptly cut off assistance and contact after the violence broke out. The Department of Defense and our Department of State can be a very positive force for reform, but this amendment would propose to limit their ability to do so. The violence happened under a different government with a weak president. 
   Make no mistake about it, this resolution will be looked upon 
   by the Indonesian people as a repudiation of the direction they have chosen and of the work of their democratically elected President and Vice President. It will be taken as a clear sign that the United States is not interested in being a positive force for change. 
   I urge--I beg my colleagues to stay involved and to pay attention because this is a vitally important part of the world. When I was in Southeast Asia 9 months ago, when I asked in one country or another how things were going, everybody would say: We are doing well, but we are worried about Indonesia. 
   We ought to be worried about Indonesia because they are the fourth largest country in the world. They have an opportunity to join the list of countries that are democracies, that are committed to human rights and freedom. They deserve to be part of the enlightened leadership of the world. 
   It is time we provided support to that effort. It is vital the United States continue to support the development of democracy and of civilian control of the military. We need to begin the process of engagement, to provide their military with the assistance and training they need to ensure that the functions of security are carried out effectively and properly. Our government has pressured the Indonesian government to restrain the military and make reforms. Now the situation is getting out of control. The military has lost its ability to respond to regional outbreaks of violence. Rather than being an impediment to progress, we ought to be in there helping them to reestablish the rule of law and order and peace and security for all people and all religious groups in Indonesia. 
   We have a tough battle ahead. There have been atrocities that are mind boggling. I join with the sponsors of the resolution who understand how terrible these depredations were. But times are changing. We need to be a positive force, to encourage those changes, to keep them on the right track, and not punish a government that is trying to move in the direction we laid out for them. 
   Mr. President, I am sure we will visit this issue again. In the meantime, I urge all my colleagues to seek counsel from our own State Department, our own Department of Defense. This Democratic administration has excellent people who are well aware of what is going on there. Let's find out from them what is happening and what we can do to be a positive force. 
   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will listen to them so we can be positive in our efforts and in our results. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Madam President, as we move into this next century, we face a great opportunity and great challenge. We need only to look backward to help contemplate the immense change and innovation that is in front of us. While positive change is to the long-term benefit of all, it typically results in short-term difficulties, anxiety, and fear for some. How we cope with those difficulties defines our vision and tests our courage. In the last century we saw the industrial age and the computer age. We experienced fits of fear regarding everything from aviation, penicillin, industrialization, computerization and most recently, the non-calamity, fortunately, known as Y2K. 
   Remarkably, plant technology in this half-century has helped make it possible for the U.S. farmer, who in 1940 fed 19 people, to fee 129 today. 
   Meanwhile, worldwide population grows and farmland shrinks, Policymakers, farmers, doctors, business leaders, scientists, and others look ahead and search for critical tools to meet the increasing demands of a growing and changing world. 
   Nobel prizewinning chemist Robert F. Curl of Rice University said that ``it is clear that the 21st will be the century of biology.'' 
   Scientists, medical doctors, Government officials, farmers, and others have testified before the Congress and elsewhere to the benefits of this new generation of technology, which may offer the sustainable production of safer amd more abundant food sources, new vaccines and medicines, as well as biodegradable plastics and cleaner energy alternatives. 
   Senator MACK hosted a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee in September entitled ``Putting a Human Face on Biotechnology'' where Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong testified about his personal experience using biotechnology and will to overcome cancer. Senators LUGAR and HARKIN held 2 days of hearings in October with a diverse number of distinguished witnesses to discuss the science and regulation of biotechnology. 
   Bipartisan members including Senators KERRY, DURBIN, HAGEL, CRAIG, FRIST, CONRAD, LUGAR, GORTON, GRASSLEY, ASHCROFT, ROBB, BURNS, GRAMS, GORDON SMITH, BAUCUS, HELMS, HUTCHISON, ROBERTS, BAYH, BROWNBACK, CRAPO, and COVERDELL have joined me in expressing to the President our bipartisan commitment to biotechnology. 
   We urge the administration and the State Department to be firm in their negotiations in Montreal, to say that the phyto sanitary agreements are adequate in all we need to regulate biotechnology. 
   As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which funds public research activities at the National Science Foundation, I have worked with my partner, Senator MIKULSKI, to win congressional approval of $150 million in the last 3 years for the Plant Genome Initiative at the National Science Foundation to study the structure, organization, and function of genomes of significant plants important to improving human health and the environment. 
   Recently, I received a letter signed by over 500 scientists revealing the exceptionally strong scientific consensus endorsing biotechnology. These are public- and private-sector scientists, the majority of whom are from academic institutions representing nearly every State, a number of foreign countries, the National Academy of Sciences, private foundations, Federal research agencies, and our National Labs. Here is some of what they told me about biotechnology:  
   The ultimate beneficiaries of technological innovation have always been consumers, both in the United States and abroad. In developing countries, biotechnological advances will provide means to overcome vitamin deficiencies, to supply vaccines for killer diseases like cholera and malaria, to increase production and protect fragile natural resources, and to grow crops under normally unfavorable conditions.  
   They continued:  
   We recognize that no technology is without risks. At the same time, we have confidence in the current U.S. regulatory system provided by the USDA, EPA, and FDA. The U.S. system has worked well and continues to evolve as scientific advancements are achieved.  
   They strongly endorse the U.S. regulatory multiagency approval system, which they say works well. 
   The American Medical Association is supportive also. In policy H-480.985, ``Biotechnology and the American Agricultural Industry'' they say the following:  
   It is the policy of the AMA to (1) endorse or implement programs that will convince the public and government officials that genetic manipulation is not inherently hazardous and that the health and economic benefits of recombinant DNA technology greatly exceed any risk posed to society; (2) where necessary, urge Congress and federal regulatory agencies to develop appropriate guidelines which will not impede the progress of agricultural biotechnology, yet will ensure that adequate safety precautions are enforced; (3) encourage and assist state medical societies to coordinate programs which will educate physicians in recombinant DNA technology as it applies to public health, such that the physician may respond to patient query and concern; (4) encourage physicians, through their state medical societies, to be public spokespersons for those agricultural biotechnologies that will benefit public health; and (5) actively participate in the development of national programs to educate the public about the benefits of agricultural biotechnology.  
   Remarkably, however, we find ourselves at a crossroads as a strange mixture of forces endeavor not to ensure that biotechnology is safe--which is and should be our collective purpose--but to discredit and eliminate biotechnology. Opposition has been motivated variously by protectionist sentiment, by political intimidation, by competing business, and by scientifically unsubstantiated fear of technology. Activists and protectionists in Europe have conspired with a level of success that is stunning. Their goal is to stroke fear and use intimidation to frustrate and undermine biotechnology. 
   Just this week, it was reported by the Detroit News that:  
   A visiting Michigan State University associate professor whose office was the target of a fire set by radical environmentalists on New Year's Eve said Sunday that she heads a project aimed at increasing food production and making food more nutritious.  
   The purpose of her work was to ensure that we use agricultural knowledge and tools to address those problems. 
   Catherine Ives, director of the Agricultural Biotechnology for Sustainable Productivity, which is based at Michigan State University, said, ``The whole point of the project is to make land more productive so we don't have to damage the environment.'' The paper reported, ``The goal of the project is to develop long-term solutions for food security in the developing world, where undernourishment is an epidemic.'' ``We know that there are 840 million people in the world who don't have enough to eat,'' Ives said. ``The use of agricultural knowledge and tools will help in addressing that problem.'' 
   Dr. Martina McGlaughlin, Director of Biotechnology at the University of California at Davis, in a November 1, 1999, column in the Los Angeles Times reinforced the dilemma of population growth coupled with the finite quantity of arable land:   
   [u]nless we will accept starvation or placing parks and the Amazon Basin under the plow, there really is no alternative to applying biotechnology to agriculture.  
   Dr. McGlaughlin continued:  
   The most cost-effective and environmentally sound general method for controlling pests and disease is the use of DNA. 
   This approach has led to a reduction in the use of sprayed chemical insecticides. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2 million fewer pounds of insecticide were used in 1998 to control bollworm than were used in 1995, before ``Bt'' cotton was introduced. And the Bt gene--introduced into the crop plant, not sprayed into the atmosphere--is present in minute amounts and spares beneficial insects.  
   She concluded:  
   Millions of people have eaten the products of genetic engineering and no adverse effects have been demonstrated. The proper balance of safety testing between companies and the government is a legitimate area for further debate. So are environmental safeguards. But the purpose of such debate should be to improve biotech research and enhance its benefits to society, not stop it in its tracks.  
   It should be mentioned that her students at Cal Davis were also victimized by law-breakers who vandalized their research testing plots. Clearly, if the radicals were as interested in understanding as they are in intimidation, eliminating research is the last thing they would consider. 
   In an Op-Ed in the New York Times entitled ``Who's Afraid of Genetic Engineers?'' former President Jimmy Carter outlined the sad irony. He said:  
   Imagine a country placing such rigid restrictions on imports that people would not get vaccines and insulin. And imagine those same restrictions being placed on food products as well as on laundry detergent and paper. As far-fetched as it sounds, many developing countries and some industrialized on may do just that.  
   He concluded:  
   If imports ..... are regulated unnecessarily, the real losers will be the developing nations. Instead of reaping the benefits of decades of discovery and research, people from Africa and Southeast Asia will remain prisoners of outdated technology. Their countries could suffer greatly for years to come. It is crucial that they reject the propaganda of extremists groups before it is too late.  
   Renowned scientists have dedicated their lives to understanding biotechnology and using it to the benefit of mankind to solve problems of hunger, disease and environmental degradation. 
   These problems are considerable now, but will grow in magnitudes in the years ahead. In the tabloid press, however, a teenager dressed up as a corn cob will get as much attention and is attributed the same credibility as leading scientists, whose work is subjected to rigorous peer review. 
   We need to be clear about several issues. First, our Government and its citizens are second to none in our collective commitment to food safety. We have a rigorous multi-agency approval process that has stood the test of time since 1938. It is based not on politics but on scientific consensus. It is supported by bipartisan Members of each body who have the strongest commitment to food safety and environmental protection. None of us are advocates for unfettered technology. As with any technology, there are limits that will be and must be subjected to law, not to mention common sense. 
   Second, we need to realize that there are strong elements in the European Union who are more than happy to exploit fears--fears that they helped create--to provide short-term protection to their farmers from imports. In a sentence, fear and hysteria, without scientific basis, is being used by some to limit the productivity of foreign farmers--period. Meanwhile, opportunistic food companies such as ADM and Novartis are knowingly undermining our scientists and trade negotiators to placate the Luddites and protectionists. 
   Finally, let me emphasize this critical point. The issue of risk is not one-dimensional. Yes, we must understand and evaluate the relative risk to a Monarch Butterfly larvae. Additional research has answered already many of those questions. But there is another risk. That risk is that naysayers and the protectionists succeed in their goals to kill biotechnology and condemn the world's children to unnecessary blindness, malnutrition, sickness and environmental degradation. 
   Dr. C.S. Prakash directs the Center for Plant Biotechnology Research at Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Ala, said the following in a column for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:  
   Anti-technology activists accuse corporations of ``playing God'' by genetically improving crops, but it is these so-called environmentalists who are really playing God, not with genes but with the lives of poor and hungry people. 
   While activist organizations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to promote fear through anti-science newspaper ads, 1.3 billion people, who live on less than $1 a day, care only about findings their next day's meal. Biotechnology is one of the best hopes for solving their food needs today, when we have 6 billion people, and certainly in the next 30 to 50 years, when there will be 9 billion on the globe. 
   Those people, who battle weather, pests and plant disease to try to raise enough for their families, can benefit tremendously from biotechnology, and not just from products created by big corporations. Public-sector institutions are conducting work on high-yield rice, virus-resistant sweet potato and more healthful strains for cassava, crops that are staples in developing countries. 
   The development of local and regional agriculture is the key to addressing both hunger and low income. Genetically improved food is ``scale neutral,'' in that a poor rice farmer with one acre in Bangladesh can benefit as much as a larger farmer in California. And he doesn't have to learn a sophisticated new system; he only has to plant a seed. New rice strains being developed through biotechnology can increase yields by 30 to 40 percent. Another rice strain has the potential to prevent blindness in millions of children whose diets are deficient in Vitamin A. 
   Edible vaccines, delivered in locally grown crops, could do more to eliminate disease than the Red Cross, missionaries and U.N. task forces combined, at a fraction of the cost. But none of these benefits will be realized if Western-generated fears about biotechnology halt research funding and close borders to exported products. 
   For the well-fed to spreadhead fear-based campaigns and suppress research for ideological and pseudo-science reasons is irresponsible and immoral.  
   Dr. Prakash just released a petition signed by more than 600 scientists declaring support of agricultural biotechnology. In his press release he noted, ``We in the scientific community felt it necessary to counteract the baseless attacks so often being made on biotechnology and genetically modified foods. Biotechnology is a potent and valuable tool that can help make foods more productive and nutritious. And, contrary to anti-biotech activists, they can even advance environmental goals such as biodiversity.'' 
   Not content to live with their own brand of ludditism, European activists have shifted the battleground and they are now looking to export--not answers or solutions or constructive proposals--but fear, hysteria and unworkable restrictions to Asia, South America and even the United States. Many have stayed out of this debate thinking the controversy will blow over as it does with most regulated technologies. Many, particularly those who understand the science of the issue, had been silent, thinking, possibly that people would understand and that the technology would sell itself. 
   I have said from the beginning that we could not take it for granted that people would embrace the technology because it is complex. I have said from the beginning that American consumers would want information. Consumers who know the facts--who know the benefits this technology will provide--will endorse it. American consumers demand food safety, but they also embrace technology and progress. They are not satisfied to say what we are doing is good enough. And finally, they want to base their decisions on science not fiction and it is the open discussion of facts that the vandals, the protectionists, and the luddites fear the most. 
   President Clinton outlined what is at stake last week in proclaiming January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month:  
   Today, a third of all new medicines in development are based on biotechnology. Designed to attack the underlying cause of an illness, not just its symptoms, these medicines have tremendous potential to provide not only more effective treatments, but also cures. With improved understanding of cellular and genetic processes, scientists have opened exciting new avenues of research into treatments for devastating diseases--like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, and cancer--that affect millions of Americans. Biotechnology has also given us several new vaccines, including one for rotavirus, now being tested clinically, that could eradicate an illness responsible for the deaths of more than 800,000 infants and children each year. 
   The impact of biotechnology is far-reaching. Bio-remediation technologies are cleaning our environment by removing toxic substances from contaminated soils and ground  water. Agricultural biotechnology reduces our dependence on pesticides. Manufacturing processes based on biotechnology make it possible to produce paper and chemicals with less energy, less pollution, and less waste. Forensic technologies based on our growing knowledge of DNA help us exonerate the innocent and bring criminals to justice. 
   A question is whether we want to continue with a fixed number of agricultural uses or if we want to expand them to provide farmers and consumers new options and new opportunities. A question for some is whether we want to be more pro-environment and pro-health and nutrition than we are anti-corporate. 
   Like many of my colleagues here in the Senate, I have consulted scores of scientists in the academic world, in the public sector and in the private sector. I have consulted medical professionals, and farmers for their practical experience regarding biotechnology. But let me finish by reading you a quote from a December 25, 1999, interview in ``New Scientist'' and you consider for yourself who might be the source:  
   I believe we are entering an era now where pagan beliefs and junk science are influencing public policy. GM foods and forestry are both good examples where policy is being influenced by arguments that have no basis in fact or logic.  
   The source is not a corporate leader, a Senator, or a university scientist. It is an ecologist with a Ph.D. 
   That ecologist is Patrick Moore, one of the founding members of Greenpeace and a veteran of the frontline against everything from whaling to nuclear waste since the 1970s. 
   The scientific consensus amongst government and academic scientists in the U.S. is extraordinary. The scientific community in Europe, some of whom I have met with agree, but have been intimidated and silenced. Please give the scientific and medical communities the opportunity to speak to these complex issues before you are swayed by the tabloids in Europe, those who may have their head burried in the flat earth, and the vandals and extremists who have been condemned even by some of their very own. 
   We have a system in the U.S. to identify and evaluate relative risk, and, if necessary, mitigate those risks. The focus of international leaders should be on working constructively to identify and evaluate relative risk so that our people may have safely the options of biotechnology available to them. The development of this technology is not recreational. It is to solve real world problems and the possibilities are truly breathtaking. There is too much at stake for those who know better to remain passive. 
   In 1921, Missouri's renowned plant scientist, George Washington Carver said: ``I wanted to know the name of every stone and flower and insect and bird and beast. I wanted to know where it got its color, where it got its life--but there was no one to tell me.'' He added that: ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' This issue will be a test of our collective vision, discipline, and courage. 
   Madam President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD materials from President Clinton, President Carter, Drs. Prakash and McGlaughlin, New Scientist, and the 500 scientists' letter.

   Mr. BOND. I too, extend my thanks to the Chairman of the Energy Committee for his willingness to help us on this very complex and difficult issue. Missouri, and other States in the Missouri River Basin are dependent on the flow of the Missouri River. Any legislation that affects this flow must be thoroughly vetted by the people in our state who have the knowledge and the expertise. Since this legislation came up at the end of the session with no time for debate on the Senate floor, we appreciate the opportunity the Chairman is providing us to bring together those people from our States who know this issue well. A forum with the free exchange of ideas is an excellent way to air very serious concerns as well as explore possible solutions that can make this a win-win situation for everyone. Representatives of the Missouri Basin States are currently in deep negotiations to discuss water flow. This forum should be held in the context of those negotiations.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, the so-called ``patent reform'' act was placed in the Satellite Home Viewer Act in the waning hours of the conference. Even though this bill did not clear the Senate floor in regular order and never had a vote on the floor of the Senate and was highly controversial for three years the proponents had to resort to these tactics to secure passage. The Satellite Act was very important and many Americans were relying on its passage so it provided the leverage. This is an unfortunate development in this legislative battle. Over the strenuous objections of several members, the bill stayed in the conference report. The inventors never even got a debate on the floor of the Senate. I think the entrepreneurs of America deserve far better than this sort of treatment. 
   Special recognition should be given to the staff of the Alliance for American Innovation for their hard work on behalf of American Inventors, particularly Steven Shore and Beverly Selby. Also, Congresswoman Helen Bentley labored tirelessly on behalf of America's inventors, they deserve a great deal of recognition for their fight. As does Jim Morrison of the National Association of the Self Employed. They won many victories in this battle and the proponents had to resort to these sorts of tactics to defeat them. It is unfortunate how this bill was handled, the American inventors deserved a debate and a vote--for all that they do for America, they deserve better. We are going to be watching carefully the impact of this bill on innovation in America.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about some important legislative matters and to announce to my colleagues I cannot and will not clear a bill called S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources Act, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It would authorize a half billion dollars to divert additional water from the Missouri River system for additional uses, including transfer to the Cheyenne and Red River systems. We cannot and will not tolerate the diversion of water. This is strongly opposed by the Governor of my State, by the State of Minnesota, by Taxpayers for Common Sense, and a whole list of environmental groups including the National Wildlife Federation, the Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth and American Rivers. The Canadian Government opposes it, the Governor of Minnesota and the Minnesota DNR oppose it. 
   I understand why the Dakota Senators want to fight for this. It would be a tremendous boon for their States. But I am not going to be blackmailed because 52 other unrelated bills are being held up over this matter. There are strong substantive objections to this bill. It is not appropriate in this process to try to ram this through, to try to steal water from the Missouri River. 
   I serve notice on my colleagues, if they have a problem because their bills are being held up in an attempt to blackmail me, it is not going to work. We have worked in good faith with the Senators from North Dakota in the past, helping them with their problems, but I do not intend to be blackmailed into allowing diversion of the Missouri River water. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Senate companion bill to legislation sponsored in the other body by the distinguished Representative from southwestern Missouri (Mr. BLUNT). This bill intends to clarify the application of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, in Missouri. 
   Specifically, this bill would prevent Indian Tribes from setting up casino gambling operations in areas of Missouri where non-Indians currently are prohibited from gambling. This is vitally important, if for no other reason than to maintain harmony in these communities. It is also essential to preserve the family-friendly atmosphere that draws so many vacationers to these areas. Branson, Missouri, in particular, has attained national fame as an extraordinarily beautiful area, with fun activities and entertainment suitable for parents and children alike. 
   An invasion of gambling into this setting would wreck this tremendous asset. It would bring all the well-known pathologies and social problems that accompany gambling. I oppose introducing gambling into these areas and will do all I can to fight it. We must protect the family spirit that makes Branson a national destination for vacationers. We must do likewise for other Missouri communities that offer similar sanctuaries from the hyperactive stress of modern life, as well as great places for residents to raise children, build homes, and do business. 
   The bill I introduce today is very similar to one I offered in 1997. That bill would also have prevented Tribally owned casinos in areas of Missouri where non-Indian casinos are currently illegal. It became necessary when a Tribe in Oklahoma applied to put land in the small town of Seneca, Missouri into trust status for gambling purposes. They wanted to operate a casino where no one else could do so legally and to do so despite overwhelming community objection. Fortunately, the Interior Secretary indicated to me that he would not approve that application, and the Tribe ultimately withdrew its gambling application. Thus, the issue was satisfactorily resolved without legislation. 
   More recently, however, a flurry of applications has been filed to put Indian-owned land into trust for non-gambling activities. I am glad the Tribes are finding that non-gambling activities, as proposed uses for these lands, can be more beneficial and more friendly to their communities and neighbors. However, a great many of my constituents are concerned that these trust applications might make it easier to apply for gambling later. They worry that some Tribes might be seeking to approve gambling casinos through the back door. This bill will eliminate that concern by clarifying the meaning of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act with respect to Missouri. 
   When the Congress adopted IGRA in 1988, it intended for a State's general policy toward gambling to be considered in evaluating applications by Indian Tribes to start casino operations. Drawing upon past court decisions in this area, the Congress provided that a Tribe might be eligible to conduct casino gambling on their lands in a State ``that permits such gambling for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity.'' Once a State decides to move away from a criminal/prohibitory stance toward gambling, and adopts instead a civil/regulatory stance, Tribes are to have the opportunity to engage in gambling in that State as well. To that end, they may ask the State to negotiate a compact to regulate those casinos. 
   Generally, this approach helps ensure public peace while also ensuring the Tribes get to participate in gambling on more-or-less the same basis as non-Indians in the State. If the people of a State, through their legislature or through direct legislation, decide to legalize casino gambling ``by any person,  organization, or entity,'' they cannot simply exclude the Tribes in favor of whatever non-Indian gambling companies might have the inside track in the State government. The Tribes are to have the same opportunity as the non-Indian companies. 
   But, if the people of a State maintain a general prohibition on gambling--whether as an expression of moral opposition or for some other reason--the Tribes will also need to respect this public opinion just like everyone else. I believe this is the situation in Missouri, whose constitution includes just such a general prohibition on casino gambling, with an exception for casinos based on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. 
   Article III of the Missouri Constitution sets out the powers of the Missouri General Assembly. Section 39 of that article makes certain things expressly outside of the legislature's authority. This is where the State's general prohibition on gambling appears. ``The General Assembly shall not have power,'' it says, ``to authorize lotteries or gift enterprises for any purpose, and shall enact laws to prohibit the sale of lottery or gift enterprise tickets.'' It says prohibit, not regulate. 
   Gambling, in general, is still prohibited by State law. Under section 572.020 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, ``the crime of gambling'' is a class C misdemeanor, unless committed by a professional player, in which case the crime is a class D felony. This means the crime of gambling is punishable by fine of up to $300 in the case of a misdemeanor. A professional player may be fined up to $5,000 or twice the amount of any gain received, up to a limit of $25,000. These criminal offenses also carry potential prison sentences, of 15 days for a misdemeanor and up to 5 years for felony gambling. 
   The State constitution does not give the General Assembly 
   authority to legalize these crimes. The power to legalize gambling was withheld from the General Assembly by the express terms of the constitution. Any change would require a constitutional amendment, ratified by the voters of Missouri. 
   The voters did exercise their authority to authorize very limited exceptions, without removing the general prohibition on legalized gambling. In the case of casino gambling, the voters authorized the General Assembly to legalize certain games only on excursion gambling boats and floating facilities docked along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Again, the voters granted these limited exceptions without disturbing the general constitutional prohibition on gambling, which is a criminal offense elsewhere in the State. 
   The initiative that created this exception took this approach because many areas of Missouri have strong objections to gambling casinos. Particularly in southwest Missouri, many citizens hold strong moral objections to gambling. Many others simply fear that gambling would destroy the family atmosphere that makes the Branson area a desirable and unique vacation spot. Still others are concerned that gambling disproportionately preys on the hopes of the poor, making it a particularly regressive economic activity. 
   We can see this expression of the community's view in the votes that were cast on the Missouri and Mississippi riverboat casino initiative. In the November 1994 election, voters in Taney county (where Branson is located) voted against the casino initiative 73% to 27%. In Greene county (where southwest Missouri's largest metropolitan area of Springfield is located), 58% of voters opposed the riverboat casinos. Finally, in Newton county (the home of Seneca, Missouri, where a Tribe once sought to impose a casino on the local residents), 62% of voters opposed the constitutional amendment. 
   Knowing the strength of these communities' opinions on gambling in general, the sponsors of the initiative petition drive had no real alternative but to leave the general gambling prohibition intact while carving out a very narrow geographic exception for Missouri's two major rivers. Otherwise, the initiative would almost certainly have failed statewide as well. Therefore, the constitutional amendment reassured southwest Missourians that they likely would not feel the change directly--it would affect only the two rivers far away from them, and would not bring casinos into the family oriented Branson and Springfield areas. The general constitutional prohibition on gambling stayed in force. 
   The limited exception for riverboat casinos, therefore, did not change the State's posture on gambling from a criminal/prohibitory one to a civil/regulatory one. In areas such as the Branson, Missouri area, gambling is still a criminal offense. IGRA's requirement that the State negotiate to allow Tribally owned casinos is not triggered, since casino gambling in that area is not permitted by ``any person, organization, or entity.'' As I mentioned earlier, that's the language IGRA uses to trigger a State's obligation to negotiate with the Tribes to create a regulatory compact. 
   Tribes wanting to operate casinos on the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers might have a case under IGRA, since there are persons, organizations, or entities authorized to gamble there. But this is not true in Branson, Springfield, or other areas off the rivers where gambling is still prohibited and where the General Assembly lacks constitutional authority to legalize it even if it wanted to. 
   This view of IGRA is not undermined, as some claim, by the Mashantucket Pequot case decided in 1990. In that case, the Mashantucket Pequots sued Connecticut to force the State to negotiate a casino gambling compact because the State authorized ``Las Vegas Nights'' as a fundraising activity for certain nonprofit organizations. Connecticut had argued that the occasional Las Vegas Nights did not mean that the State had decriminalized gambling in general. 
   However, those nonprofits authorized to operate casinos, even on a very occasional basis, fall within the express language of ``any person, organization, or entity'' used in IGRA, which is what the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found. Allowing nonprofits to engage in some forms of casino gambling did move the State of Connecticut into a civil/regulatory stance on casino gambling. The State did not absolutely prohibit it; it regulated the type of organization permitted to engage in gambling. Thus, IGRA was triggered by the express language of the law. 
   This is completely different from the situation in Missouri, where all persons, organizations, and entities are flatly prohibited, by criminal law, from casino gambling anywhere but on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The Mashantucket Pequot case does not apply to the Missouri situation. Geographic limitations, like in Missouri, were not at issue in that case. 
   Thus, the language of this bill does not really change the current policy of IGRA. It simply makes explicit what is already plainly implicit under current legislation and case law. It would take express notice of the provision in Missouri's constitution on gambling and recognize that Missouri still maintains a criminal/prohibitory stance toward gambling off the rivers. 
   Because some pro-gambling advocates are attempting to read the Mashantucket Pequot case too broadly, trying to make it apply to Missouri when it clearly does not, this bill is essential. In the past, a number of Tribes have tried to use that argument to try to set up casinos in Missouri--even in a small town like Seneca, nowhere near the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers. Because some people are trying to read into the Mashantucket Pequot case a view that is really not there, this bill writes into law the correct interpretation. 
   I appreciate the hard work my colleague in the other chamber did on this bill, and am glad to have the opportunity to resolve this issue once and for all.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 (S. 791). This bill is the latest step by the Committee on Small Business to strengthen the Women's Business Center program at the Small Business Administration (SBA). Since this program first opened its doors in 1989, it has grown from an initial 12 centers to 81 centers operating in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The bill I am bringing before the Senate today will increase the authorization level for the Women's business Centers program. Further, this bill establishes a four year pilot program that will, for the first time, allow centers that have completed a grant or that are in their last year of a grant under this program to apply for a second, five year grant.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' (S. 1346). This bill is designed to build on the success achieved by the Office of Advocacy over the past 23 years. It is intended to strengthen that foundation to make the Office of Advocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses throughout the United States. I introduced the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' on July 1, 1999. Two weeks later, on July 15th, the Committee on Small Business voted unanimously, 17-0, in favor of this important legislation. 
   The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal government. It is part of the Small Business Administration (SBA/Agency), and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the Office is also intended to be the independent voice for small business within the Federal government. It is supposed to develop proposals for changing government policies to help small businesses, and it is supposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses before other Federal agencies. 
   As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the independent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also a part of the President's Administration. As you can imagine, those are sometimes difficult roles to play simultaneously. 
   The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' would make the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent advocate within the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small business community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless of the position taken on critical issues by the President and his Administration.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to express our profound sorrow at the loss of a dear friend and an outstanding Senator. JOHN CHAFEE was probably the finest gentleman ever to serve in this body. We offer our sincerest regrets, our sympathies, and our prayers to his family. 
   I stopped by his office today and expressed my sense of loss to his staff. We express, collectively, our deep sorrow to the people of Rhode Island, but, beyond that to the people of the entire Nation who in many different ways, in many different areas, were served so well by JOHN CHAFEE throughout his career. 
   We have just heard very eloquent remarks from the majority leader and his colleague from Rhode Island, summarizing some of the many things that  JOHN CHAFEE has done. It would take several volumes of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD to go through his list of achievements and the things that he has done for the least among us to further the causes in which he felt so strongly. 
   But I rise today to express gratitude and to celebrate the legacy that he left us. If you had to ask somebody: Who is the most decent person that you know of in politics? chances are, JOHN CHAFEE would be at the top of that list. He was a man, as has been said, who had very strong feelings. 
   He fought hard for principles, but he fought so with unfailing courtesy, with compassion and kindness and consideration for others who had differing views. 
   I had the privilege of working with him on a health care task force in 1993 and 1994. I sat in a room and listened to him bring together people of very strongly opposing views. Always, without fail, he guided the discussions away from bitterness, away from harshness, into constructive channels. 
   I was pleased to work with him on environmental and public works issues. And he was a great leader of a committee that has very contentious issues. He worked together with his leadership. We made progress, sometimes in areas where people thought progress could not be made. 
   I followed his work on so many issues affecting health care and children from his position in the Finance Committee. He was there to move not just this body but the country forward in assuring that we would meet the needs of children. Whether it was Medicaid for poor children or the foster care bill that he was recently championing, he was always looking out for those in need; but he did so in a manner that is a good lesson for all of us. 
   When somebody got carried away and attacked him, perhaps a little too strongly, he turned it away with a warm smile and understanding. When views got very heated and the arguments got passionate, he would calm it down with a kind word and steer the discussion and the debate back in a constructive pattern. 
   When some of us had personal reverses, JOHN CHAFEE was there quietly, as a friend, to lend support, to lend encouragement, and to let us know that we had a friend, somebody who cared for us. 
   If there is one thing I hope this body will remember, it is that record, that unfailing, consistent pattern of being, first and foremost, a concerned human being who was a dear friend. 
   I hope that legacy can guide this body, that all of us can strive to emulate his service, his compassion, and his caring. As our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his loved ones, and to all who will miss him, I hope we will remember and hold high those principles which he not only espoused but he lived. 
   I am from Missouri. One of our slogans is: Show me. JOHN CHAFEE's life showed us every day, every hour in this body what a fine human being can do to move the process of government forward on a constructive path. I only hope we can hold dear and remember those lessons he taught us. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the generosity of the majority and minority leaders for allowing us to proceed on the consideration of the Senate conference report to accompany H.R. 2684. 
   I ask that the Chair advise me when 5 minutes have been utilized. I want to save some of my time and be able to yield to my distinguished colleague from Maryland. 
   This has been a very difficult bill, not unlike, as someone suggested, riding a tilt-a-whirl at the county fair. I am glad to say the ride is over. It was fun while it lasted. We are finally on solid ground with this conference report. 
   We have a bill that meets many priorities of the Members and I think addresses fairly a number of concerns of the administration without totally satisfying everyone. 
   First, my sincerest thanks to Senators STEVENS and BYRD for helping us to reach an adequate allocation. Without their help, this bill would still be a work in progress, and we would not be able to complete it. 
   A very special thanks once again to Senator MIKULSKI, who worked with us to find a good balance in making some very difficult funding decisions. It was a pleasure as always to have her good guidance and sound judgment. 
   I believe she will join me in saying a special thanks to the new Chair and ranking member in the House, Chairman WALSH, and Congressman MOLLOHAN, who were a tremendous pleasure to work with. We appreciate their assistance. 
   My thanks to staff on the minority side: Paul Carliner Jeannie Schroeder, and Sean Smith; on my side, a very special thanks to Jon Kamarck, Julie Dammann, Carolyn Apostolou, and Cheh Kim. 
   I believe the bill before the Senate is a very good bill with funds allocated to the most pressing needs we face. Total spending is $72 billion in budget authority and $82.6 billion in outlays. It is roughly the same as the President's overall request for the VA-HUD subcommittee, plus FEMA emergency funds. 
   Unlike the President's budget, the highest priority is the recommendation before the Senate for VA medical care, which has increased $1.7 billion above the President's request as directed by this body, and it is fully paid for in the bill. We have also included significant new funds for 60,000 incremental vouchers, additional funds above the President's request for public housing, capital and operating funds, as well as the President's request for NSF, and an additional $75 million for NASA. 
   All of these funding levels have been fully offset. In addition, there has been $2.5 billion in emergency FEMA funding for the victims of Hurricane Floyd, to whom our hearts go out. 
   As I noted, the conference agreement provides $44.3 billion for veterans funding, which includes a full $1.7 billion for medical care. This is the largest increase ever for VA medical care--clearly the highest priority of this body. 
   I point out that the vouchers we have provided do not create additional housing. There was discussion on this floor that we desperately need to increase the production of affordable low-income housing. In many areas, such as St. Louis in my State, housing is not available for the vouchers that are there. We have had to use budget gimmicks suggested by the administration, deferring $4.2 billion of section 8 funding for fiscal year 2000 expiring section 8 contracts until fiscal year 2001. That will create an additional $8 million funding requirement, or some $14 billion in BA needed in fiscal year 2000 if we intend to renew all expiring section 8 contracts. 
   To be clear, this means we will go into next year's appropriation cycle with a funding shortfall of over $8 billion. We emphasized our concern to the administration for their failure to work with Members on dealing with this funding crisis. Last year they promised to help, but the only thing we got this year was a deferral of $4.2 billion. This year, in discussions and negotiations, we reached agreement with Jack Lew, the Director of OMB, who has personally promised they will work with Members to address the funding shortfall in BA in the section 8 account. We expect Mr. Lew and the administration to live up to that commitment. Nevertheless, we cannot keep writing blank checks on an empty account. The outyear projections we have from OMB are for flat funding, which means 1.3 million families kicked out of section 8 housing. 
   To reiterate: 
   Many of us have been hearing from veterans in our state for some time about their concerns with VA's budget. They have been hearing that their local VA hospital may lose numerous employees, terminate critical services, increase waiting times for appointments, may even shut down altogether.  The additional $1.7 billion above the President will ensure none of these things happen. VA will be above to expand services and care to thousands of additional veterans. VA will be able to accommodate increased costs associated with pharmaceuticals, prosthetics, and pay raises. 
   At the same time, we strongly support continued improvements and reforms to the VA health care system to ensure VA medical care dollars go to health care for vets, not maintaining buildings and the status quo. 
   Other increases in VA's budget include VA research, the state cemetery grant program, the state nursing home construction grant program, and the Veterans Benefits Administration. These are all critical programs and very high priorities. 
   EPA funding totals $7.6 billion, the same as FY99 and $383 million above the President's request. Funding increase were provided for the state revolving funds--which the President had proposed cutting by $550 million. We have accommodated administration concerns in such areas as the Montreal Protocol. 
   We were forced to make some tough choices and eliminate or reduce lower priority, lower risk programs in order to accommodate higher priorities. The appropriation protects core EPA programs such as NPDES permitting, RCRA corrective action, and pesticides registration and re-registration. 
   FEMA funding totals $870 million, an increase of $44 million over FY99. This includes an increase of $10 million for the emergency food and shelter grant program, $25 million for the Project Impact grant program, $5 million in start-up funds for the flood map modernization initiative, and increases in critical programs such as anti-terrorism training. In addition, we have included $2.5 billion in emergency disaster assistance--funding which is truly needed. 
   We have funded the Department of Housing and Urban Development at $27.16 billion, which is some $2.5 billion over last year's level and which will allow us to put HUD on some very solid ground. Because of the priority needs for our veterans, we had to make some tough choices, and in HUD's case, that meant not funding any of HUD's 19 new programs and initiatives. Instead, we have focused on funding HUD's core programs, such as public housing, CDBG, HOME, Drug Elimination grants, and Homeless Assistance and Section 202 Housing for the elderly. These are the key housing and community development programs that make a critical difference in people's lives, and they are programs with a proven track record. 
   Also, we funded 60,000 new incremental vouchers. I continue to have major concerns about this program--vouchers do not produce or assist in the financing of any new housing and we desperately need to increase the production of affordable, low-income housing. In addition, in many areas of the country, including areas in my state such as St. Louis, vouchers are very difficult to use--the housing which is affordable under the voucher program is just not available. In addition, against my better judgment but because we do not have the funds in our allocation to meet the funding needs of our key programs, we have used the Administration's budget gimmick of deferring $4.2 billion of section 8 funding for fiscal year 2000 expiring contracts until fiscal year 2001. This will create an additional $8 billion funding requirement for a total of some $14 billion in BA needed in fiscal year 2001 if we intend to renew all expiring section 8 contracts--to be clear, this means we already have a funding shortfall in the VA/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 of over $8 billion. 
   I want to emphasize my concern with the Administration's past failure to address this section 8 funding crisis; the Administration has created this hole and up to now has not acted responsibly in meeting these funding requirements. And I have gone to the top. In this year's negotiations on the VA/HUD appropriations bill, Jack Lew, the Director of OMB, personally has promised to address the funding shortfall in the section 8 account. I expect Mr. Lew and the Administration to live up to this commitment. Nevertheless, this is the same song and dance we heard from HUD last year when the Secretary of HUD personally promised to address section 8 costs and them responded by pushing much of the section 8 costs into FY 2001 and the outyears. Writing blank checks on an empty account is unacceptable, and under the Administration's outyear budget projections, section 8 contract renewal funding will be flat funded at $11.5 billion which means over the next 10 years some 1.3 million section families will lose their housing. This is wrong and I do not plan to sit by and let it happen. 
   I also want to emphasize several issues of particular importance to me. First, I introduced the ``Save My Home Act of 1999'' earlier this year to require HUD to renew expiring below-market section 8 contracts at a market rate for elderly and disabled projects and in circumstances where the housing is located in a low vacancy area, such as a rural area or high cost area. 
   The bill also provides new authority for section 8 enhanced or ``sticky'' vouchers to ensure that families in housing for which owners do not renew their section 8 contracts will be able to continue to live in their homes with the Federal government picking up the additional rental costs of the units. It is important to preserve this housing, and these provisions are included in the VA/HUD appropriations bill as well as other important elderly housing reforms. 
   With respect to NASA, the bill funds the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at $75 million above the President's request of $13.6 billion, including needed funding for the International Space Station and the Shuttle. I know NASA funding was a huge concern for many Members because of the House reductions of some $900 million. 
   For the National Science Foundation, the bill includes over $3.9 billion, which approximates the Administration's request. NSF's allocation is over $240 million more than last year's enacted level--about a 6 percent increase. This increase in funds continues our commitment and support for the Nation's basic research and education needs. 
   Some of the major highlights of this allocation include $126 million in additional funds for computer and information science and engineering activities; $60 million for the important Plant Genome Program; and $50 million for the Administration's ``Biocomplexity'' initiative.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his comments on the lack of available housing. We have been talking about the lack of available housing. Over the years prior to the time my ranking member and I were leading this committee, we stopped issuing long-term, 15-year section 8 vouchers. Those long-term vouchers were sufficient to generate new housing. The 1-year vouchers we now issue generally under the section 8 program do not create any new housing. 
   As I said in my opening remarks, half the vouchers issued in St. Louis County have already been used. We have programs such as the HOME program, the CDBG program, the section 202 elderly, the section 811, disabled, the hop-up program and HOPE VI programs which do provide housing. 
   We also provided additional assistance to maintain the public housing stock that is in danger of falling into disuse and becoming HOPE VI housing. That having been said, part of our discussions with the administration and with the authorizing committee will be the need to look at how we are going to assure there is adequate housing stock. This is a question not just in the appropriations process where we are putting in money where we can to create new housing; it is something we have to work on with the Finance Committee to make sure low-income housing credits exist. 
   This is a problem that simply adding some incremental section 8 vouchers is not going to solve; that and the budget authority problem for section 8 we will have to deal with next year. 
   The Senator also laid out a good argument for authorizing the committee to consider expanding veterans' benefits and programs. Again, we are happy to work with the authorizing committee when it gets beyond the appropriations measures and attempts to improve the programs in addition to just funding them. 
   Again, my very special thanks to the distinguished Senator from Maryland whose guidance, and not just assistance, but guidance and good humor, made this ride on the tilt-a-whirl an enjoyable one, even though somewhat too exciting at times. I thank her. Her help and her persuasion, and that of the administration, helped us achieve passage of this bill. 
   I reiterate my thanks particularly to Paul Carliner on that side and the great John Kamarck on our side, as well as the other staffers. 
   I yield the floor and yield back my time.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I believe is vitally important to the health care of children and pregnant women in America. The goal of this legislation is simple--to make sure more pregnant women and more children are covered by health insurance so they have access to the health care services they need to be healthy. 
   The need is great--on any given day, almost 12 million children and almost half a million pregnant women do not have health insurance coverage. For many of these women and children, they or their family simply can't afford insurance. Many others are actually eligible for a public program like Medicaid or CHIP, but they don't know they are eligible and are not signed up. 
   Lack of health insurance can lead to numerous health problems, both for children and for pregnant women. A child without health coverage is much less likely to receive the health care services that are needed to ensure the child is healthy, happy, and fully able to learn and grow. An uninsured pregnant woman is much less likely to get critical prenatal care that reduces the risk of health problems for both the woman and the child. Babies whose mothers receive no prenatal care or late prenatal care are at-risk for many health problems, including birth defects, premature births, and low birth-weight. 
   The bill I am introducing--along with Senators BREAUX, MCCAIN, and BAUCUS--deals with this insurance problem in two ways. 
   First, it allows states to provide prenatal care for low-income pregnant women under the state's CHIP program if the state chooses. 
   Through the joint federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program, states are currently expanding the availability of health insurance for low-income children. However, federal law prevents states from using CHIP funds to provide prenatal care to low-income pregnant women over age 19, even though babies born to many low-income women become eligible for CHIP as soon as they are born. 
   As many as 45,000 additional women could be covered for prenatal care. There are literally billions of dollars of CHIP funds that states have not used yet, so I would hope that most states would choose this option. This provision will not impact federal CHIP expenditures because it does not change the existing federal spending caps for CHIP. Babies born to pregnant women covered by a state's CHIP program would be automatically enrolled and receive immediate coverage under CHIP themselves. It is foolish to deny prenatal care to a pregnant mother and then--only after the baby is born--provide the child with coverage under CHIP. Prenatal care can be just as important to a newborn baby as postnatal care, and the prenatal care is of course important for the mother as well. 
   Second, the bill will help states reach out to women and children who are eligible for--but not signed up for--Medicaid or CHIP. 358,000 pregnant women and 3 million children are estimated to be eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid. Millions of additional children are eligible for but not yet enrolled in CHIP. When Congress passed the welfare reform bill back in 1996, we created a $500 million fund that states could tap into to make sure that all Medicaid-eligible people stayed in Medicaid. The problem is that only about 10 percent of that fund has been used, and most states are about to lose their 3-year window of opportunity to use these funds. My bill would allow states continued access to these funds by eliminating the 3-year deadline, and it would give states more flexibility to use the funds to reach out to both Medicaid and CHIP-eligible women and children. 
   This legislation is a smaller piece of a bill I introduced earlier this year called Healthy Kids 2000. By extracting it from the larger bill, we get a chance to show the widespread support I believe exists for these measures. I believe this is crucial legislation, and urge my colleagues to join me in support of it so that we can pass this bill.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the perfecting amendment corrects an error in the date in the language we provided in the original amendment. 
   This is an amendment with respect to ergonomics. The issue of protecting employees against workplace injuries is critically important. We all can and must agree to that. However, we are concerned about the proposed actions of OSHA. Small businesses and concerned employers know that ensuring safe workplaces is critical to their employees and to their businesses. It is in their best interest to protect employees from workplace injury, but they can only accomplish that goal without regulations that are unduly harsh. They need to proceed on a basis that is carefully thought out, makes sense, and is based on sound science. 
   Since the 1990s, OSHA has been trying to develop a rule that would tell employers what they are supposed to do to protect employees from ergonomic injuries. But the agency still has no answers to fundamental questions that need to be answered before a regulation can be issued or will be effective. These questions are basic: How much lifting is too much? How many repetitions are too many? How can an employer determine what part of an injury is due to workplace factors? And, perhaps most important: What can an employer do to prevent injuries or to cure an injury that has happened? 
   After all the effort and time OSHA has spent on developing their proposal, there is not a single threshold or recommendation contained in it. Instead, it basically says to employers. ``We know there's a problem, and we can't figure it out. So we expect you to figure it out for us, and we will inspire you with fines and penalties if you don't.'' 
   That doesn't make much sense. 
   As I said before, employers--particularly small businesses--know how much they can lose in lost time and lost employees through ergonomic injuries. They want help and good guidance. They don't want to say: Take your best guess and we will fine you if you are wrong. That is no way to do business. 
   The amendment I propose today delays the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) proposed standard on ergonomic protection until the essential scientific research to support this standard has been completed. Sound science to support a sound safety standard. 
   Some opponents have tried to deflect attention from the flaws and lack of scientific basic for OSHA's proposal by mischaracterizing this amendment as ``anti-women.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. To use the words of several women construction business owners representing the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC): ``Safety has no gender.'' 
   We all want to promote safe and healthy workplaces. To date, voluntary efforts by the business community have led to a 17 percent decline in repetitive stress injuries over the past 3 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This includes a 29 percent decline in carpal tunnel syndrome cases and a 28 percent decline in tendinitis cases--two of the most commonly cited ergonomic injuries. Such injuries make up just 4 percent of all workplace injuries and illnesses. 
   There are too many. We need to do better. But we need to do so based on sound science so employers, and particularly small businesses, will know what reasonable standards they should meet so they can protect their employees, which they, I believe, not only want to do but which is in their economic self-interest to do. 
   Despite this decline in ergonomic injuries, OSHA is on a rampage to impose new mandates with no clear thresholds or guidance to address the causes of these injuries. This irresponsible behavior helps no employee--woman or man. 
   Some proponents of OSHA's ergonomics standard have argued that because many large companies have been able to spend significant resources of time and money to solve ergonomic problems in their workplaces, all employers should now be required to do this. The problem with using these examples as the basis of a regulation is that each one of these companies approached the problem differently, and was able to address the problem in a way that made sense for them in their workplace and in their business with their employees. It does not follow from these examples that OSHA should seek to impose on all employers a regulation that will have to fit a wide variety of companies. There is a vast difference between Ford Motor Company being able to implement an ergonomics program and a small business being able to hire the necessary consultants, purchase the necessary equipment, and possibly redesign its processes to address ergonomic questions. 
   OSHA'a ergonomics rule is different from all other OSHA regulations that establish a threshold for exposure to a specific hazard and then tell the employer that if an employee exceeds that threshold, certain measures must be taken, or exposure must be reduced. 
   Because of this vagueness of OSHA's proposed standard, and the impact it would have on small businesses which would be forced to comply with it, I introduced the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence Act--the SENSE Act--S. 1070 on May 18 of this year. 
   The amendment I offer today is fundamentally the same as that bill. It is simple and direct--it tells OSHA that it may not proceed with publishing a proposed rule on ergonomics until after fiscal year 2000. Why? 
   Because by that time National Academy of Sciences is expected to have completed a study that Congress and the President agreed upon last year. This study is intended to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to answer those questions I just laid out and to support a regulation on ergonomics. 
   We agreed to pay $890,000 for a study. As I said, Congress agreed, and the President signed it. If we are to disregard that, we waste the money, and we don't get the benefit of the investigation that has been going on during this period of time and is expected to make a sound basis for proceeding in a scientific manner to do something about workplace ergonomic injuries. But if OSHA publishes its proposal first, that is a classic example of what I have described as the bureaucracy's desire for, ready, fire, and aim. You need to figure out what you need to accomplish, and how you can do it before you start out and do it. 
   My amendment would not preclude OSHA from continuing its study of this issue, and I urgently call on the agency  to redouble its efforts, especially in light of the report of the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy, which I received last week. 
   That report is very critical of OSHA's estimates outlined in the agency's Preliminary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the proposed ergonomics standard. In fact, the report concludes that ``OSHA's estimates of the benefits of the proposed standard may be significantly overstated.'' In other words, this standard may not help employees--women and men--as much as OSHA would have us believe. 
   Equally troubling is the report's conclusion that the cost of the ergonomics standard to all businesses could be as much as 15 times more than what OSHA estimates. Moreover, the report emphasizes that the cost of the ergonomics standard could be as much as 10 times higher for small businesses than for large companies. 
   So for what a large company would have to do for employees, if it had to pay $1,000 per employee, a small business might have to pay $10,000 per employee. Those are some pretty significant margins of error. If this rule goes forward, small business, once again, is left holding the bag. 
   The report also points out that ``a small business is not simply a large business with fewer employees. Many factors affect how a standard may impact a small business much differently than a large business.'' It goes on to discuss the fact that small businesses often have higher employee turnover rates meaning that any training requirement will have a more significant impact on the small firm than the large one. 
   For women business owners, the cost issue is particularly worrisome. As AGC's women construction business owners put it: ``Women-owned companies are the fastest growing sector of our economy. Unfortunately, burdensome regulations are a barrier to women starting their own businesses. Often, these regulations discourage women from starting a new business or expanding an existing one.'' 
   Mr. President, one thing is very clear--this is an extremely complicated issue. And we must have more reliable cost and benefit estimates--not to mention sound science and thorough medical evidence--before we push the Nation's small businesses into another maze of redtape. 
   If there are regulations which are burdensome but which are necessary on the basis of sound science to protect against ergonomic injuries, then let OSHA set them out. Let everybody abide by those standards. But when we don't even know what best medical and scientific evidence provides, why are we going forward down a blind alley with nothing but a huge cost at the other end? 
   Employees have a right to expect regulations will achieve realistic benefits to them--not exaggerated lofty goals that miss the mark and help no one. 
   Let me be clear about something. When you talk to workers who are in businesses or in jobs where they do lifting and work, they are very much concerned about their medical care. 
   They are very much concerned about their pension. They are also concerned about their job. 
   We are talking about something that could be a job killer. If we are telling this employee--because we have issued a standard without scientific basis--the cost may be so great that your employer can't afford to continue to hire you, what favor have we done that employee? If she is put out of work because the unknown requirements of a very expensive regulation are too much for the employer to bear, that woman could lose her job and lose the means of livelihood in the name of lessening ergonomic injuries, without any proof that they do so. 
   Let me stress again, we all agree in protecting employees from workplace injuries, it is extremely important. That is something we must do, we must assure. Employers want employees to be safe. If your mother, father, sister, or brother is working in a job with lifting or repetitive motions, the employers want them to be safe. However, small firms cannot accomplish the goal of worker protection through ill-conceived and poorly supported proposals such as OSHA's ergonomic standard which has such potential burden for small business. If the burdens are too high, the business may not survive. 
   As I indicated earlier, this has been a concern that women-owned businesses have shared. If a business folds, there are no employees to protect. Where is the sense in that? OSHA is doing everything in its power to get its proposal published soon. The House passed legislation on this issue, the Workplace Preservation Act, H.R. 987, by a vote of 217-209. I think it is time for the Senate to add its voice to the call for OSHA to act responsibly, to act dispassionately, but to act in good science. 
   To summarize: We don't have the science; we don't have the medical evidence; we don't have accurate cost figures; we don't know the benefits to employees; and we don't know what works in preventing injuries. Moreover, OSHA doesn't know those either. All we have is a potentially burdensome standard that small businesses, whether owned by a woman or a man, can ill afford. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make certain that OSHA's ergonomic standard is based on sound science and ensure that we are protecting men and women in the workplace. I hope we can get a reasonable time agreement so views on both sides can be expressed and we can proceed to a vote on this very important amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it has become clear to me that my amendment, which would force OSHA to do their job correctly instead of hastily, is a bigger concern to those on the other side than the wide range of benefits that the underlying Labor/HHS appropriations bill provides. This disappoints me tremendously. 
   However, because the Labor/HHS appropriations bill will provide funding for so many programs that will help causes I support, I will not allow my amendment to prevent passage of this bill. 
   By allowing OSHA to go forward at this moment, we are saying that it is  acceptable for an agency charged with protecting employees to promulgate a regulation that has insufficient scientific and medical support. We are saying that it is acceptable for OSHA to tell employers that we don't have the answers, but we expect you to come up with them, and we will fine you if you don't. We are saying that it is acceptable for an agency that should be focusing on helping employers protect their employees from hazards, instead to tell them that they have no idea how to help them do this, but it would be OK for them to be cited just the same. 
   The heart of this issue is that although there have indeed been many studies conducted, they have not managed to answer the critical questions that employers need to know to be able to protect their employees: ``How much lifting is too much?'', How many repetitions are too many?'', and ``What interventions can an employer implement to protect his or her employees?'' This is what we mean by saying that there is not sufficient sound science to support this regulation. 
   This regulation, whenever it comes out and takes effect, will be the most far reaching regulation ever issued by OSHA. It will be one of the most far reaching regulations from any agency and will ultimately effect every business in this country. To say that we will allow OSHA to proceed with a regulation of this nature, that we know is horribly flawed and without adequate scientific and medical support, borders on a dereliction of our duty. 
   Many speakers opposed to my amendment have focused on the number of workers who are believed to be suffering from ergonomics injuries. One of the great uncertainties about this issue is that we don't even know what it means to be in that group. That number includes many people who suffer from common problems like back pain which may or may not have any connection to the workplace. What constitutes a musculoskeletal disorder is one of those questions around which there is still no consensus within the medical and scientific communities. 
   Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA has jurisdiction only over workplace safety questions. If the condition which represents a hazard is not part of the workplace, OSHA has no authority to compel an employer to address the problem. With ergonomics, there is no way for an employer to be able to tell when a condition has arisen because of exposures at the workplace or because of activities or conditions that have nothing to do with the workplace. Many factors such as age, physical condition, diet, weight, and even family history can influence whether someone is vulnerable to an ergonomic injury. We still don't know why two workers doing the same work for the same amount of time will have different experiences with injuries. It is simply beyond an employer's role and ability to ask them to determine how much of an injury may have been caused by factors outside their control. I do not believe that we should be telling employers that they should intrude into their employee's private lives to the degree that would be necessary to eliminate all possibility of suffering an ergonomic injury. 
   I will continue to seek opportunities to come back to this issue because I believe so strongly that without sound science on this issue, OSHA's regulation on ergonomics will force many small businesses to choose between complying and staying in business. Under this decision everyone loses. However, in the interest of moving the Labor/HHS appropriations bill, I will allow my amendment to be withdrawn.

   Mr. BOND. After discussing this difficult decision with Missouri constituents, the Missouri legal community, and the Missouri law enforcement community, I have determined that Ronnie White is not the appropriate candidate to serve in a lifetime capacity as a U.S. district judge for eastern Missouri.  
   The Missouri law enforcement community, whose views I deeply respect, has expressed grave reservations about Judge White's nomination to the Federal bench. They have indicated to me their concern that Judge White might use the power of the bench to compromise the strength of law enforcement efforts in Missouri. 
   Given the concerns raised by those in Missouri's law enforcement community, who put their lives on the line on a daily basis, and those in Missouri's legal community, who are charged with protecting our system of jurisprudence, I am compelled to vote against Judge White's confirmation.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I wanted to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues the very clear, overwhelming message I received as I traveled over the State of Missouri and met with teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school board members. They asked me a very simple question: Why is it the people in Washington know so much more about our needs than we do? How are you, in Washington, DC, so smart, to know that what we really need is more teachers? 
   I can tell you instance after instance where, for example, they say: Look, we are in a small school. We only have so many classrooms. We cannot put another teacher in those classrooms. What we need is more equipment. Do not give us the money for a teacher for whom we do not have a classroom, or do not give us more money for another teacher when our salaries are so low we have to raise all the teachers' salaries in order to make sure we keep good people in teaching. It is not just quantity. In a lot of these areas it is getting the money to pay for quality teachers. That is why I believe the Gorton proposal is the way to go. 
   I have talked to those in small school districts who say: Do you know what we would get? We would get .17 of a teacher, 17 percent of a teacher. That makes a pretty poor teacher, when you have only 17 percent of the teacher. They have not quite figured out how to usefully employ seventeen one-hundredths of a teacher. 
   But that is the extreme case. The real case, time and time again, is that this is viewed in school districts around my State, and I suggest it would be viewed that way in your own States if you asked them, that Washington is not so smart as to know what each district--whether it is North Callaway or the Scotts Corner or the Martinsburg-Wellsville-Middletown School District needs another half a teacher, or a teacher-and-a-half. Those decisions should be made by the school boards that represent and serve the parents of the district who employ the superintendents and the principals and the teachers. 
   I proposed something called a direct check for education, which is molded on the work of my colleague, Senator GORTON. That has had overwhelming support from people who actually do the job of teaching our students. We entrust the future of our students to these people. Then we come in from Washington, DC, and say: We are a lot smarter; we know what you need in the  school district. One size does not fit all. Washington's solution is not right in every school district. I can assure you of that. I can assure you the people who are responsible, the people who are elected--usually by the constituents in that district, the patrons of the school district--want to see the best for their children. 
   Do you know what bugs them? Do you know what is causing them problems? It is all the time and energy they waste in filling out the forms on how they used that 17 percent of a teacher. Filling out those reports, sending them to Washington to keep more bureaucrats busy, does not educate a child or teach the child to read. It doesn't help that child figure out multiplication or division or even to learn about science and history. We need to get the Federal redtape and regulations and misdirected priorities off the backs of the schools that are laboring to teach our kids. 
   If you have any confidence at all in public education, public education in America today is, and must be, controlled at the local level. Yes, it is a national priority. It must be a national priority. 
   I commended President Bush when he set out to start the work of raising the standards and the expectations for everybody in America to improve our education system. That is a national priority. But it is a local responsibility. Let us not impose our will on local officials, school board officials, parents, principals, and the teachers on how to spend that money. 
   I think this is a clear-cut case where we want to trust the people who teach our kids. They know the kids' names, they know the kids' problems, and they know the kids' opportunities. 
   I urge support of the Gorton amendment. I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the American Royal. The American Royal is an annual Fall event that has contributed much to the Kansas City area over the last century. The Royal features world-class horse and livestock competitions; a top-ten PRCA indoor rodeo; as well as many educational and scholarship programs that foster the development of tomorrow's leaders. The American Royal is truly the Midwest's largest and oldest agricultural extravaganza. From the world's largest Barbecue, to the outstanding parade, music and comedy, to the elegant Concert of Champions, the Royal has something for every member of the family. 
   Even though the Royal began in the 19th Century, it still plays an integral role in the community by providing a connection to Kansas City's rural roots and by celebrating the value of working in agriculture. For many, being a part of the Royal's livestock shows or rodeo can be the highlight of their career. Not only does the Royal offer agricultural competition, but there are  also educational tours of their museum, scholarships and programs for college age youth. 
   Mr. President, I am truly proud of the contribution the American Royal has made to Kansas City, the state of Missouri, and the entire country over the last 100 years. I wish the Royal well as they continue to be America's best agricultural expose' well into the next millennium.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999, S. 1156. This bill was approved by the Committee on Small Business which I chair, with unanimous bipartisan support. Senator KERRY, the Ranking Member of the Committee, was the lead cosponsor of this important small business legislation. 
   Our bill is simple and straightforward. It clarifies and amends certain provisions of the law enacted as part of my ``Red Tape Reduction Act,'' the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. In 1996, this body led the way toward enactment of this important law. With a unanimous vote, we took a major step to ensure that small businesses get an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process when their input can have the greatest impact, and that they are treated fairly by federal agencies. 
   The overall purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, is to identify and minimize the burdens of the regulations on the small businesses affected by the agency's actions, and to help the agency make the rule as effective as possible when it is implemented. 
   Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which amended the Regulatory Flexibility Act, each ``covered agency'' is required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel (Panel) to receive advice and comments from small entities that will be affected by the regulation being developed. Specifically, under section 609(b), each covered agency is to convene a Panel with representatives from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget, the Chief Counsel of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and the covered agency promulgating the regulation, to receive input from small entities prior to publishing an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for a proposed rule with a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Panel produces a report containing comments from the small entities and the Panel's own recommendations. The report is provided to the head of the agency, who reviews it and, where appropriate, modifies the proposed rule, Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis or the decision on whether the rule significantly impacts small entities. The Panel report then becomes a part of the rulemaking record. 
   Under current law, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are the only agencies covered by the Panel process. So far, the results are encouraging with these agencies clearly benefitting from the input of the small entities that have participated in the review panels. In addition, the bill will bring the Internal Revenue Service, the agency that has perhaps the most pervasive impact on small businesses, into the Panel process by mandating the agency to convene panels for certain proposed rulemakings that will impact small businesses. 
   Our bill also clarifies how the Regulatory Flexibility Act generally applies to the IRS. In 1996, Congress expressly included the IRS within the coverage of the Red Tape Reduction Act which amended the Regulatory Flexibility Act. However, the Treasury Department has interpreted the language in the law in a manner that essentially writes them out of the law. The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 clarifies which interpretative rules involving the Internal Revenue Code are to be subject to compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As I noted previously, for those rules that will impose a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the IRS will also be required under our bill to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel as required by SBREFA. 
   If the Treasury Department and the IRS had implemented the Red Tape Reduction Act as Congress originally intended, the regulatory burdens on small businesses could have been reduced, and small businesses could have been saved considerable trouble in fighting unwarranted rulemaking actions. For instance, with input from the small business community early in the process for their 1997 temporary regulations on the uniform capitalization rules, the IRS could have taken into consideration the adverse effects that inventory accounting would have on farming businesses, and especially nursery growers. Similarly, if the IRS had conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, it would have learned of the enormous problems surrounding its limited partner regulations prior to issuing the proposal in January 1997. These regulations, which became known as the ``stealth tax regulations,'' would have raised self-employment taxes on countless small businesses operated as limited partnerships or limited liability companies, and also would have imposed burdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information requirements. 
   Specifically, the bill strikes the language in section 603 of title 5 that limits inclusion of IRS interpretative rules under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, ``only to the extent that such interpretative rules impose on small entities a collection of information requirement.'' The Treasury Department has misconstrued this language in two ways. First, unless the IRS imposes a requirement on small businesses to complete a new OMB-approved form, the Treasury Department contends that the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. Second, in the limited circumstances in which the IRS has acknowledged imposing a new reporting requirement, the Treasury Department has limited its analysis of the impact on small businesses to the burden imposed by the form, ignoring the more substantive and complicated burdens. As a result, the Treasury Department and the IRS have turned Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance into an unnecessary, second Paperwork Reduction Act.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, prior to beginning the time, I would like to announce that this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill and the pending Wellstone amendment regarding atomic veterans. Following the 2 minutes for closing remarks, the Senate will proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment. Senators can therefore expect the first rollcall vote this morning in just a couple of minutes. Following that vote, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts will be recognized to offer an amendment regarding section 8. 
   There are further amendments on the list that must be disposed of prior to the vote on final passage. However, we hope the Senate will complete action on the VA-HUD bill today at a reasonable time. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the morning. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota has been a devoted advocate for veterans who have been exposed to atomic radiation. I commend him for his advocacy. He has for 3 years pursued attaching legislation to this bill. However, the legislation is properly under the VA subcommittee's jurisdiction. The VA has opposed amending this law because, No. 1, it would cost over $500 million in additional entitlement payments over 5 years. The VA has the authority and the responsibility to make the medical judgments as to whether these are, in fact, service-connected disabilities, and I suggest that this body does not have before it the medical evidence or the scientific proof needed to make that kind of judgment. We commend the Senator for being interested and concerned about these veterans, but we are not in a position to make the medical judgment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are pleased to be able to work with the Senator from Massachusetts, the ranking member on the housing authorization committee. We know there are  great needs. We are very pleased we have been able to work with the Senator and provide an additional $7 million for section 8, for the HOPWA program and the section 811 program. When we talk about availability of housing, section 811 does provide additional housing. In many of the section 8 programs, we find they cannot create new housing. Having a certificate without a place to live, without a place to use it, doesn't do any good. The section 811 program has been at a static level of $194 million over the last decade. We were able to provide in the original mark for an additional $40 million in section 8 for persons with disabilities. 
   Section 811 is a construction program for persons with disabilities. This is a modest increase. It is well deserved. I appreciate working with my ranking member, Senator KERRY, to get this done. 
   I yield to the Senator from Maryland.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments that have been made about the need for affordable housing. Unfortunately, this problem is bigger than just section 8. Section 8 is a real problem, as I outlined several days ago. 
   To repeat, we used to have multiyear section 8 contracts, 10-, 15-year section 8 contracts. That allowed landlords to obtain financing to build housing. 
   In the last 10 years, we have gone from 10-, 15-year contracts down to 2-year and 1-year budget authority appropriations. In order to save money in the overall spending caps in budget authority, they shortened the contracts. That means, No. 1, as these contracts expire, we are spending over $20 billion a year in outlays on section 8 contracts. Those outlays are in the budget. But the budget authority needed rises every year, from $3.6 billion in 1997 to $8.2 billion in 1998 to $11.1 billion in 1999, and the need is $12.8 billion for fiscal year 2000. That number goes up to $18.2 billion by the year 2004. Unfortunately, that is how we budget around here, on how much budget authority you request. 
   The problem we have with the administration seeking additional section 8s is that in their recommendations, their OMB budget request, they say they are going to appropriate $11.3 billion for the next 10 years. As those needs for more appropriations continue to rise, we will wind up kicking 1.3 million families out the back door. 
   First, let's make clear, we are not going to let that happen. We have to protect those who are actually in publicly assisted housing. We have to scrape, we have to do everything we can to find the funds to do so. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned the 50,000 additional vouchers the administration sought. Two things: I was promised by the Secretary of HUD the budget submission this year will account for those additional 50,000 vouchers, which we will accept into the stock, and we are renewing all the vouchers that are coming due. Unfortunately, instead of making provision in the budget for the additional 50,000, the administration proposed, and we have had to accept, a deferral on an advanced appropriation of $4.2 billion. In other words, we were $4.2 billion short of the budget authority needed to continue all of the section 8 certificates expiring this year. This means we rolled over into 2001 $4.2 billion. So we are falling way behind in the budget authority and being able to maintain the section 8 certificates we have now. 
   In addition, we have heard people say: The need is now for section 8 certificates. None of the 50,000 vouchers we approved last fall have been used. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. None of them have been used. The administration has not gotten them out. We have discussed this problem, but they have not gotten them out. We are trying to renew vouchers that have not been used this year. We cannot use money that was not used this year to add new vouchers next year when we have already included provisions for the vouchers that we authorized last year and they have not been used. 
   Probably the most important thing--and this is the point on which we really are going to have to get to work--is that a 1-year section 8 voucher does not create a house. It does not create an apartment. It does not create a condominium. Nobody can finance the construction of housing on the promise of a 1-year section 8 voucher. 
   Right now in St. Louis County, for every 100 vouchers they issue, only 50 of them are used because there are no places physically to house the people who need housing. That is why we put money into HOME, into CDBG, to increase the stock of housing. That is why we have the low-income housing credits. That is why we have section 202 which does build housing for the elderly. 
   We are not suffering a lack of housing because of a lack of section 8 certificates. We are suffering a lack of housing because in many areas they just have not been built. 
   We will work with people on both sides of the aisle to create housing that is needed, to give somebody a certificate. That certificate does not keep the rain off them; it does not keep them warm in the winter. They have to have shelter. Merely giving them a section 8 voucher does not create a shelter when there is no shelter available. It will enable them to pay the rent if there is one available, but in too many areas there is not. 
   This is a subject for much discussion later on. I look forward to working with the Senator from Massachusetts and the others who have talked about it. This is not a section 8 problem. We have our own section 8 problems with the budget authority needed. The real problem is providing housing. 
   I commend groups such as Enterprise and LIST. I commend local units. I commend people who are working under the low-income housing tax credit, housing authorities across the Nation such as the Missouri Housing Development Commission, and Habitat for Humanity. They are the ones who are providing shelter. These are the places we have to look in many areas for a house. 
   I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his insights on this measure. Unfortunately, we are in a budgetary situation where we cannot provide additional section 8 certificates in this current budget.

   Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. 
   I say, very quickly, to my colleague from Delaware, I appreciate the kind words he said about the ranking member and me, but I have to disagree with all the rest he said. 
   I am not going to make the argument here. There is a plan. We have a budget. We are faced with problems in this allocation, not because of any tax cut but because of the budget caps that were adopted by Congress and signed into law by the President. 
   There is a plan, and I will leave it to the Budget Committee members and the leadership of the committees to describe that plan. We have added money above the caps this year for the costs of military actions. That is why there will be work on the Labor-HHS bill to raise the money necessary within the available surplus. It has nothing to do with the tax cut. We will not be touching Social Security.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2000 VA-HUD-independent agencies appropriations bill to the Senate. This legislation provides a total of $90.9 billion in budget authority, including $21.3 billion in mandatory budget authority and $82.3 billion in outlays, while covering a variety of Federal interests from veterans, housing, the environment, basic research, to advances in space. 
   This has been a very tough year, as I believe all our colleagues know. We have waited a long time to bring this bill to the consideration of the full Senate. I express my sincerest thanks to my chairman, Senator STEVENS, the ranking member of the full committee, Senator BYRD, and to my colleague, the ranking member from Maryland, for their hard work and commitment to ensuring that the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee has enough funding to meet the minimum needs of our many important programs. 
   However, with 2 weeks before the end of the fiscal year, we are on a forced march to complete Senate action and provide a conference agreement to the Senate for consideration. I believe the bill before the Senate is a good bill under the constraints imposed by budgetary limitations and a fair bill with funds allocated to the most pressing needs we face. 
   Let me emphasize we balanced our funding decisions away from new programs and focused instead on the core primary programs in our bill on which people depend. We listened very carefully to the priorities of our colleagues in this body. While not everyone is happy, nor could they be, we believe the bill is equitable. 
   Clearly, we were not able to provide fully what each Member requested. Let me note that we received some 1,400 requests from Members of this body, but we attempted to meet the priority needs. Before describing what is included in this legislation for each agency, I wish to extend my sincerest thanks to Senator MIKULSKI, the ranking member of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, for all her hard work and cooperation in putting this bill together. It is not possible, without the good working relationship that we have, to deal with such a complicated bill. 
   Let me add at the beginning, and I will repeat it again, my sincere thanks also to Senator MIKULSKI's staff, Paul Carliner, Jeannine Schroeder, Sean Smith, as well as my staff, Jon Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, Cheh Kim, and Joe Norrell. The contributions of the staff to this process have been invaluable. Anybody who has watched the staff work on a major bill knows how much time, effort, energy, pain and suffering is endured at the staff level to bring a bill to the floor. 
   The VA-HUD fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill is crafted to meet our  most critical needs for veterans, housing, the environment, basic scientific research, and advances in space. As I noted, total spending in this bill is $69.6 billion in budget authority and $82.3 billion in outlays. This is roughly the same as the President's overall request in the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee but distributed with some significant differences. 
   Unlike the President's budget, the highest priority in the recommendations before the Senate is VA medical care. In the bill before the Senate, we have increased this amount by $1.1 billion above the President's request. Many Members have heard from veterans for some time about their concerns about the VA budget. They have been hearing their local VA hospital may terminate critical services, increase waiting times for appointments, maybe even shut down altogether. Members have expressed concerns about the need for additional medical care funding. 
   The Vice President recently told our Nation's veterans they wished to provide more money, but so-called Priority 7 veterans were not going to get care any more. We asked VA to do an indepth field survey to find out what the President's budget as originally submitted would mean. We found there would be major cutbacks in services, denial of services for some veterans, closing of facilities, reductions in force totaling as many as 13,000 employees and, what is most important, denial of critically needed care to thousands of veterans. We are absolutely not going to let that happen. It is wrong. 
   Overall, the VA budget totals $43.75 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion more than the President's request. In addition to medical care, funds were added to the veterans State home and State cemetery grant programs to meet the tremendous backlog in these programs and ensure that we meet the needs of our aging veterans, honoring those who are deceased in a dignified and respectful manner. 
   VA's full request for additional funds for the Veterans Benefits Administration includes ensuring much-needed improvements to the processing and delivery of veterans' benefits. We are, as we speak, working to find additional funding for veterans' medical care, and we expect to be able to present an amendment very shortly on that particular matter that we think will further lighten the burdens and stresses placed on the Veterans' Administration and ensure it can continue to provide top quality medical care to those who have put their lives on the line for the peace and security of all and for the freedom of the United States. 
   Moving on to the other major elements in this bill, we have funded the Department of Housing and Urban Development at $27.16 billion, which is some $2.35 billion over last year's level and which should allow HUD to be on very solid ground. Because of the priority needs of our veterans, we had to make tough choices. In HUD's case, that meant not funding HUD's requested 19 new programs and initiatives. Instead, we focused on funding HUD's core programs such as public housing, CDBG, home and drug elimination grants, homeless assistance, and section 202 housing for the elderly. These are the key housing and community development programs that make a critical difference in people's lives. 
   They are programs with a proven track record. 
   Also, unlike last year when we funded 50,000 new incremental vouchers, we do not have the funds to provide incremental section 8 assistance this year. Frankly, against my better judgment, because we do not have funds in our allocation to meet the funding needs of our key programs, I have accepted the administration's budget proposal to defer $4.2 billion of section 8 budget authority for fiscal year 2000 expiring contracts until fiscal year 2001. In other words, the budget authority will be appropriated for the amounts to be expended on section 8 certificates in fiscal year 2001 to the fiscal year 2001 budget. The good news is we were able to continue funding this year. But the bad news means we will have to find $8 billion more in section 8 budget authority in fiscal year 2001 for a total of some $14 billion in budget authority in order to renew all expiring section 8 contracts in fiscal year 2001. 
   Permit me to emphasize and call to your attention several issues of particular importance in this bill. 
   First, I introduced the Save My Home Act of 1999 earlier this year to require HUD to renew expiring below market section 8 contracts at a market rate for elderly and disabled projects, and in circumstances where housing is located in a low-vacancy area such as rural areas or high-cost areas. 
   We have heard from too many States around this country where tenants in section 8 projects have been thrown out because the landlord in a tight market thought higher rents could be obtained at market rate. While this is certainly an understandable move, it deprives the citizens who have depended upon section 8 of the vitally needed services that they must have. So, despite our request, there has not been effective action to deal with those expiring section 8, or the so-called opt-out programs where landlords leave the section 8 program. 
   This bill provides new authority for section 8 enhanced, or sticky vouchers, to ensure that families and housing for which owners do not renew their section 8 contracts will be able to continue to live in their homes with the Federal Government picking up the additional rental cost of the units. 
   We think it is essential to preserve this housing, and we have therefore included $100 million in new section 8 assistance to ensure that there is adequate funding for renewing these section 8 contracts. We believe this strong direction to HUD will ensure that the appropriate steps--and there are other steps that are preferable to sticky vouchers, but we have given them a wide range of tools to use in ensuring those who live in opt-out housing are not deprived of housing. 
   We are disappointed about some of the reactions we have heard to this budget. We believe we are doing our job and doing it responsibly. We have heard objections from HUD. But we are funding HUD's program in a responsible, no-nonsense way. 
   Under this appropriations bill, unlike the course that the administration is on, no one will lose their housing, and in many cases the funding will ensure new low-income housing and home ownership opportunities. 
   We are concerned more and more about HUD's capacity to administer its programs. As I said, HUD has raised a red flag on many issues. We funded the primary programs mostly at the President's level--and a number above that level. I also do not believe that new programs at HUD should be a priority in part because of funding pressures but also because HUD does not have the capacity to administer effectively its programs. And we do not wish to bring in new programs without the benefit of the authorizing committee's approval on it. 
   HUD remains a high-risk agency, as designated by the General Accounting Office--the only agency ever designated on a department-wide basis. I do not believe it needs additional responsibility until it corrects its significant problems. 
   I hope every single Member understands what I am saying because people have reported to me concerns they have had with HUD. We have not been able to approve HUD's request. They need to understand that it is only one of eight major agencies that depend on the VA-HUD subcommittee allocation for their funds, and we have attempted to do our best to assure adequate funding for the core programs that are vitally important. 
   Moving on to other agencies, for EPA, we included a total of $7.3 billion, an increase of about $100 million over the request of the administration. We thought we needed to restore the President's $550 million cut to the clean water State revolving fund. The Clean Water Program and the Safe Drinking Water Program are critical to assure success in restoring and protecting our Nation's water bodies. It is a matter of the environment. It is also a vital matter of public health. 
   As we see problems in this country brought about by hurricanes and floods, everybody realizes that contaminated water supplies is one of the greatest health problems we face. This clean water State revolving fund allows States day in and day out to move forward in assisting local communities to clean up their wastewater to make sure we are not polluting the environment and endangering the health of our citizens. There is still a great deal  to do in this area. We have provided as much assistance as we can. 
   EPA has been revising its estimate of the nationwide need for water infrastructure financing upward. It is now about $200 billion. That is why I find it a little difficult to understand why the proposal was to cut this program by 40 percent. We think that is the wrong choice. We reverse the cut. 
   The highest priorities, in my view, in EPA must include State grant programs and those activities geared to addressing the biggest environmental risk we face. We had to cut out some new programs--some critical programs--to protect fully EPA's core programs. In addition, we added funding for grants to States to enhance their environmental data system. That is a critical need and should help improve the integrity of EPA's data system. 
   Moving on to the other agencies, FEMA funding totals $85 million of which $300 million is for disaster relief. While we were unable to accommodate the full budget request, there are additional funds we believe are high priorities added for important initiatives such as antiterrorism training, enhancing the fire training program, and emergency food and shelter grants. Despite the damage caused by Hurricane Floyd, FEMA has adequate reserves on hand--approximately $1 billion at this time--to meet their anticipated obligations in the near future. We are going to be monitoring these needs closely, of course, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure adequate funds are on hand to respond as needed to this and other disasters that inevitably occur. 
   We commend FEMA's efforts in hurricane-ravaged areas. Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims of these natural disasters, and our thanks go to the very strong response that the people of FEMA, and all of the related emergency agencies--both government and private sector agencies--have been able to provide. 
   Next, moving on to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this bill fully funds NASA at the President's request of $13.6 billion, including full funding for the international space station and the shuttle. I know NASA was a huge concern for many members of the committee and the Congress as a whole because the House, due to its shortened allocation, was forced to reduce funding by some $900 million. 
   This bill makes a major structural change to the NASA accounts by providing separate funding for the international space station and the space shuttle. We believe this account change is necessary because of NASA's continuing problems in controlling spending on the space station, especially enhanced by Russia's unreliability in meeting its obligations as an international partner to the space station. We have, however, provided transfer authority to allow space station funds to be used to meet any needed safety upgrades for the shuttle. 
   The only other major change in NASA funding is we have reduced the funding for space by $120 million from the President's budget request in part to fund new launch and space transportation technologies designed to reduce the cost of space transportation and to open up commercial opportunities in our universe. 
   Many Members have been interested in this program, and these funds are authorized in both the House and Senate NASA authorization bills. I know the occupant of the Chair has been a very strong advocate for this kind of research and development. 
   For the National Science Foundation, the bill includes over $3.9 billion, which matches the administration's request. The NSF allocation is over $250 million more than last year's enacted level, about a 7-percent increase. The increase in funding continues our commitment and support for our Nation's basic research and education needs. 
   On a personal note, I was very pleased we were able to meet the President's request for NSF because of the tremendous amount of exciting and potentially beneficial work that is being funded through the National Science Foundation. Truly, this is a national priority. I only wish more funds were available to add because this is our scientific future. This is the future for our economy, for the well-being of the people of the United States, and for our continued progress. 
   Some of the major highlights of this allocation include $126 million in additional funds for computer and information science and engineering activities, some $60 million for the important Plant Genome Program, and $50 million for the administration's ``Biocomplexity'' initiative. The bill also includes $423 million for the incorporation for national and community service. This is near last year's level. 
   Let me be clear, funds totaling $80 million were rescinded from the prior year's appropriations for the program which are currently sitting in reserve. The inspector general tells us they are not needed. It is our understanding this rescission 
   will have no programmatic impact, but it is necessary for us to meet the other priorities in our budget. We intend to assure the Corporation continues at the level from last year, and we believe this budget allocation allows us to do so. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to yield the floor to my colleague and good friend, the Senator from Maryland.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have seen the legislative equivalent of Newton's second law: For every action, there is a necessary reaction. When our colleagues in the House cut the earth sciences program, it was predictable that with the leadership of Senator MIKULSKI, that money would be restored. The law works, and I commend Senator MIKULSKI for being a very effective and persuasive advocate for earth science. 
   I am prepared to offer a committee leadership amendment, but the distinguished chairman of the authorizing committee for housing has other commitments, and I now defer to him to make a statement on the bill, after which I expect the leaders of the committee to join us in offering an important committee amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment with the leadership of the committee on both sides. Senator MIKULSKI and I are very pleased to have the support of Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, and also chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, to add $600 million for VA medical care. In addition to the committee-reported bill, there will be a total of $1.7 billion above the President's request for veterans' health care; in other words, $19 billion for veterans' health. 
   These funds will enable VA to ensure full care to all 3.5 million veterans being currently cared for by the VA. They will also allow VA to provide care to thousands of additional veterans, significantly reduce waiting times for appointments, and initiate new activities to improve veterans' health. They will also enable the VA, upon enactment of authorizing legislation, to fund emergency care treatment in non-VA facilities for veterans. We do need authorizing assistance for that. 
   According to the GAO, there are still many opportunities to make VA health care more cost effective. These include improved procurement practices, consolidation of certain services, eliminating excess management layers and administration, and shifting more care to outpatient settings. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo at the VA. The GAO recently testified that the VA is wasting $1 million a day on operations and maintenance of buildings and monuments that could better be used on health care for veterans, and 25 percent of the medical care budget is spent on maintaining VA infrastructure, including 4,700 buildings on 22,000 acres. 
   The VA has been moving to community-based care, outpatient-based care. That has been dictated by the needs of the veterans. We are in a position where we must provide the care the veterans need. We have to support the VA in restructuring the entire system, consistent with the health care needs of veterans, rather than devoting ourselves to maintaining buildings in the old regime. Monuments are not what the veterans need in health care; they need good health care. 
   Not only is it the trend in general medicine outpatient-based care, but the veterans population is declining. The VA projects a 36-percent decline by 2020. By adding funds to the VA's budget, we in no way suggest that the VA has done all it can to improve its use of health care dollars. 
   I have been and continue to be a very strong supporter of VA transformation. When the Veterans' Administration started the process, one of the first surgical centers they shut down was in my State. It was tough to explain, but it is, I believe, clear that the veterans get better care when we have appropriate facilities--not keeping open a surgical center, for example, where they do not perform enough surgeries to maintain the proficiency they need to provide top-quality care. The funds we are adding today are for veterans' health, not maintaining buildings, not maintaining excessive management layers. 
   Over the past 5 years, the VA has made dramatic and much-needed changes. We congratulate them on these difficult processes. We want to work with them and continue to assure sound oversight. The system has begun a major transformation that has resulted in more of VA's appropriations going to health care. Today, VA is serving more veterans and the quality of care has improved. In the past 3 years, VA has served an additional one-half million veterans, in part by opening almost 200 new community-based clinics. 
   It is my strong hope that the transformation will continue to go forward and additional funds will improve the quality of VA health care. I might note that Senator GRASSLEY has asked to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
   I yield to the Senator from Maryland.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may answer my colleague, that is a good question. The committee leadership and the Budget Committee have agreed we should provide this as an emergency authorization now. The allocation will be handled in the conference committee. So we are asking to include this as an emergency. There is no offset in this bill. There will have to be funds provided in the conference. The House had already provided the $1.7 billion additional. They took it out of NASA. We are not going to take it out of NASA. We have the assurance of the bipartisan committee leadership that we will be able to handle this allocation in the conference. 
   So the simple answer at this point is there is no offset.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his strong words in support of the VA. He has been a champion of the veterans affairs activities and his role in the authorizing committee is very important. 
   I have been asked by the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator SPECTER, to be added as a cosponsor. I also ask unanimous consent Senator MURKOWSKI be added as a cosponsor. I ask consent that Senator MIKULSKI and I be permitted to add cosponsors to this amendment after it is adopted. We sense there is a strong feeling of interest and support for this issue. 
   Before I conclude, let me say we have worked very closely with the General Accounting Office in this area. The GAO has been to every one of the VA's 22 networks over the last few years. They have been closely involved in the VA's transformation. I strongly support continued improvements in the use of VA health care funds. These funds need to be spent on veterans' care, not on monuments. 
   I believe we are ready to accept this amendment on voice vote.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I should clarify that I was not asking unanimous consent that all amendments be in by 3 p.m. I am hoping the leadership  will be able to clear an agreement establishing a time. This was an expression of hope. I am sure my distinguished colleague from Maryland has the same hope burning in her heart that I do in mine, but it is not ripe to propound as a unanimous consent at this time. 
   I was not asking unanimous consent on the 3 p.m. for filing all amendments. We hope we can get a reasonable time. 
   The distinguished ranking member of the full committee wishes to speak. I need to make just a few quick points about the Wellstone amendment. 
   We have, as everyone knows, been working for some time to determine how much VA needs in its budget. We knew that the budget submitted to us was entirely inadequate, and we know that the VA's own Under Secretary issued a memorandum last February indicating his concerns about it. There were no details in the President's budget. So in our committee, where we have responsibility for preparing a budget, we take requests, and these requests we judge in good faith. 
   We have the responsibility of allocating the scarce dollars. We asked the VA and its networks to put together plans as to how they would operate. That is where we learned about the closures, cutbacks in care, reduction of 13,000 employees. We saw that was a disaster. We asked VA about the proposed management efficiencies that networks said could be implemented, and should be implemented, to improve the efficiency of VA care, and they said about half of them could be. So they are finding money by making savings within their budget. 
   The things that they are doing are commonsense, good practices, such as bulk purchasing, improving prescription patterns, centralizing certain functions, closing unused buildings, and so forth. We are going to have to do more of that. 
   To be clear, we expect continuing reforms. We want to see good health care for veterans. In many instances in the past, that has not been accomplished purely by throwing in more money. We need to make sure the money is effectively spent. We have provided an additional $600 million to make sure they have the funds adequate to ensure the health care dollars do deliver to the needs of veterans. 
   The amount we have agreed to, this addition of $1.7 billion, is, I understand, the highest increase ever for VA medical care. The amount we have agreed to in the budget of $19 billion will allow VA to provide more care and better care to our veterans. Also, I should note that the Veterans Affairs budget has not been flatlined. We have been adding about $100 or $200 million a year, and we think that this increase, a very significant one, is vitally important. 
   The proposal the Senator from Minnesota made would not take money from the surplus. It would take money from Social Security. We are working within very tight budget constraints to provide an additional $600 million. Any dollars above that will come straight out of Social Security. The $14 billion is onbudget, non-Social Security funds and has been used up in emergency spending for agriculture, the census, and other emergencies. There is no free money floating out there. That is one of the constraints under which we must operate on the Appropriations Committee. That is why the leadership of the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Alaska, and the Budget Committee has been so important to make that we could provide additional funds. 
   I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has some comments.

   Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Ohio for cogent and knowledgeable comments. We appreciate his assistance. I thank the Senator for his statements. 
   Let me make a couple of brief points about the two amendments before the Senate. This year, 51 Senators wrote me in support of a $1.7 billion increase in the veterans' medical care budget. The budget resolution which passed this body assumed a $1.7 billion increase for VA medical care. We have worked hard to meet the needs that we believe are responsibly identified for veterans' medical care. We would love to have more money but we are at the end of our available stream of funds. 
   We have increased funding for homeless assistance for the veterans by $40 million. That is why I cannot support either of these amendments. 
   With respect to Senator SMITH's amendment, I have had significant concerns about the operations of AmeriCorps. I have worked closely with the inspector general to clear up some of the agency's management problems. There was a problem with $31 million that was lost. We are very much concerned about it. The battle over whether we ought to have an AmeriCorps program or not is over. It has been decided. It is authorized. It is funded. It is in place in communities in my State and across the Nation. There are people who are providing valuable services. There is strong support. 
   We have attempted to continue AmeriCorps at the existing level. We did rescind $80 million because the inspector general identified that money as not needed. However, we have to develop a bill that will be signed by the President. The President has already threatened to veto any bill that cuts 
   AmeriCorps. It is that simple. If you want the additional funding we provided for veterans, the additional $1.7 billion above the President's request, then we have to have the bill signed. It is a rather simple matter. If this bill is vetoed over AmeriCorps, then we can't get the money for veterans. To ensure that the operations of AmeriCorps are properly addressed, we boosted the inspector general's budget from $3 million to $5 million to oversee the work of AmeriCorps. The concept has already been approved. It is in place. It is ongoing. 
   For the information of all Senators, we expect to have a vote at 2 o'clock on a motion to waive the budget point of order, followed by a tabling motion on the Smith amendment. We are hoping everybody who has first-degree amendments will get them in by 4 o'clock. We have not propounded a unanimous consent request. People are busily working on amendments. I do not want to discourage Members from doing that. We want to see an end to the process. 
   I have had a number of colloquies provided to me. I appreciate that people get them in. Colloquies sometimes explain the difficult and complex parts of a bill. If a Member has a colloquy which they want included, I ask Members to get those colloquies in by 5 o'clock this afternoon. We do have to review them. Sometimes we need clearance from the authorizing committee. If we are hit with a rush of colloquies at the last moment, we may simply not be able to deal with them and get them read and approved. In order to get colloquies in, I hope Members will bring them to the ranking member or me prior to 5 o'clock to review them.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as you can see, it is a simple amendment. It strikes sections 427 and 428. They were put in the bill to amend the Fair Housing Act to provide a 72-hour cooling off period for newspapers that had been accused of having published an item that was alleged to have been discriminatory. The two major publishers in my State and publishers around the country presented to us what they thought was a very unfair situation. We thought we could accommodate them with this provision in the bill. 
   However, Senators KENNEDY and HARKIN have raised substantive concerns and pointed out that this amendment would violate rule XVI. I therefore offer this amendment to strike these provisions so we do not have to have a battle over rule XVI.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his kind words and note with gratitude that he did point out we disagree. This is a great relief to many of my constituents. I thank him for that acknowledgement.  
   But seriously, this very important amendment, the Wellstone amendment, would eat into the Social Security reserve. It ignores the fact that a majority of Members of this body wrote me in support of a $1.7 billion increase. I therefore state that the pending amendment, No. 1747, offered by the Senator from Minnesota, increases spending in excess of the allocation to the Appropriations Committee; therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.

   Mr. BOND. Let's be honest. There was a budget surplus. We spent it. It is gone. It is done. We had the increased spending for defense because we made commitments in many areas around the world and we have to defend and support our fighting men and women when we ask them to put their lives on the line for us. We have to remedy the shortfall that every one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the President's budget has caused. We are spending it on agriculture. We approved a $7-plus billion ag relief bill that came out of this body. It is now in conference. We have to put money in for the census. We have spent the money. It is gone. 
   So what this amendment seeks to do is to take an additional $1.3 billion out of Social Security. The Senator says we have to provide priorities for veterans. We just added $1.7 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care--the largest increase in veterans' medical care in history--to allow expanded care to thousands of veterans, initiating new programs for veterans, helping homeless veterans, providing for inflationary increases, enabling the VA to treat the veterans who have hepatitis C with a new therapy. 
   The Veterans' Administration is making cuts, increasing efficiencies, good business practices that will enable them to serve more. The money we have already provided should assure good quality care for the next year in the health care facilities for our veterans.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me express my gratitude to the Senator from North Carolina for outlining the tragic situation he faces in his State. As one who has faced similar circumstances in my State, seeing nothing but the tops of flooded buildings, I can tell you I was very grateful for then-chairman of the committee, Senator MIKULSKI, who came to my State and worked with us during the floods of 1993. I know there is nothing more important to these people who have lost everything than to know that somebody is trying. There is no way we can make them whole. We intend to see that FEMA meets their needs. 
   I have already discussed with the senior Senator of North Carolina some of the needs. I assure both Senators that we on the committee will do whatever is necessary to make sure FEMA has the resources needed. We believe they have adequate reserves right now, but we are going to continue to work on this problem and follow FEMA's activities. We look forward to working with the Senators from North Carolina to make sure we do have adequate resources available. 
   I join with the Senator from North Carolina in saying we appreciate and congratulate James Lee Witt and the entire FEMA operation for what appears to be a very prompt response to a disaster situation.

   Mr. BOND. What happened to Maine, and other States, in the competitive award process simply should not have occurred. To me, it is quite puzzling. As many of us know, the problem of rural homelessness is complicated; it is pervasive. I live in a rural area. Rural areas have higher poverty rates and a higher percentage of the population living in inadequate housing, which are key factors contributing to homelessness. Providing service to the rural homeless is not easy. It is complicated by distance, isolation, and lack of effective communication.

   Mr. BOND. I certainly agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator  from Maine. I am very sympathetic to the intent of the bill. As she has pointed out, we are not able to accept it on this bill. But I do look forward to working with the Senator from Maine, and the many other Senators who expressed their concerns, to ensure that HUD does meet the homeless needs of every State. 
   In the past, I have been a strong supporter of using block grant approaches to the States, which I think can best serve the needs of the homeless. We look forward to working with the Senator and the authorizing committee to solve the current HUD award process problems. 
   I thank the Senator from Maine for bringing this very real and very compelling problem to our attention. 
   I assure her we will continue to work to resolve the problem.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a good time to do a couple of things. We started off with a good pace and had a major amendment approved by voice vote. Then we had votes on two more amendments. We have had some wonderful speeches and some great colloquies. We are open for business. It is daylight. We want to get people here because we face a tremendous deadline with the end of the fiscal year approaching. We need to get this bill passed this week to make sure we keep these agencies funded. I ask colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please, if you have amendments, colloquies, or items we need to deal with, please bring them. Otherwise, I am ready to go to third reading in the not too distant future. 
   Something has been brought up which I hope we can spend some time discussing. A number of my colleagues have talked about the tremendous need for housing. They have equated that with the need for additional section 8 incremental or additional assistance.  
   I want to go through some of the difficult problems we face. Perhaps as I straighten out in my own mind the complexity of section 8, my colleagues will understand why we came to this point. This bill does not provide any of the 100,000 incremental section 8 vouchers requested by the President. The addition of these vouchers to the bill would cost an additional $578 million per year. Last year, we agreed to the President's absolutely necessary request for 50,000 additional section 8 vouchers. We pointed out at the time that this caused a real problem, and we would need additional money to fund them in future years. The representatives of the administration assured Members they would make provisions for that additional required budget authority. 
   What did we get this year from the administration? We received a request that we defer $4.2 billion in budget authority to the following fiscal year. In other words, they were not able in their budget presentation to fund existing certificates, the section 8 vouchers, before we added the incremental, and they asked that $4.2 billion be deferred. In other words, their recommendation to us was $4.2 billion less than is needed to renew section 8 vouchers on a full-year basis in fiscal year 2000. That ought to demonstrate there is a problem. 
   Let me explain as best as I understand it what the problem is. The section 8 account is one of the most difficult accounts 
   for funding in the bill. Not only would the administration's request for 100,000 new incremental vouchers result in an annual cost of almost $600 million each year, it does not acknowledge or address the long-term funding needs of this account. Let me be specific. We currently fund some 3 million section 8 vouchers or assisted living units, as well as 1.5 million public housing units. Much of the cost of these 3 million units is hidden, meaning the annual cost in outlays is some $20 billion. In other words, we are paying out this year $20 billion in section 8 vouchers. We appropriate around here on budget authority. Most of the costs were accounted for in previous year's budgets when the Congress approved long-term 15-year and 20-year section 8 contracts. 
   Now, the budget authority was committed in future years, but they said OK, Congress, you are going to have to pay out all that money each year in outlays. What is even worse, the budget authority requirement each year goes up because as contracts expire, we renew contracts on a year-to-year basis. We have to put that budget authority in each year's budget. As these contracts expire, we have to pay for the expiring contracts as an annual recurring cost in the section 8 account. 
   Let me show you a chart. This is how the budget for section 8 has gone up. In fiscal year 1997, we only had to appropriate $3.6 billion in budget authority to cover the $20 billion or so, almost $20 billion in section 8 vouchers. The next year, we had to come up with budget authority of $11.1 billion. In the current year we would have had to come up with $12.8 billion, but we have adopted, because of the tight budget, the administration's proposal to defer $4.2 billion of that into fiscal year 2001. 
   Guess what happens. We are coming into fiscal year 2001 about $8 billion short in budget authority. If we are to fund the existing contracts next year, we are going to have to come up with $8 billion more in budget authority. The news does not get any better. The next year, we would have to come up with $15.6 billion, the next year $17.0 billion, the next fiscal year 2004, $18.2 billion. 
   This year, the administration has requested and we have proposed deferring $4.2 billion. So we took the easy out. The only easy out was deferring that $4.2 billion in budget authority for those portions of the section 8 vouchers which would actually have to be funded, actually outlayed in fiscal year 2001. 
   That is confusing. I have worked on it for a long time. I am happy to work with any of my colleagues who have questions about it. With the help of staff, I think we can explain it. However, we made long-term commitments in budget authority. Each year, we have been spending outlays at a very high level. However, we can't get the budget authority to rise to the level needed to maintain those outlays. 
   What is worse, in the HUD budget submitted by OMB--this is their 10-year budget. This is the budget projection they sent us--for this year, they said budget authority is right about what is needed, close to $14 billion. But for the coming year, the next year, they have lowered that to $11.3 billion for BA. 
   Here is the BA need creeping up each year. Each year, it increases. The long-term projection of OMB, the President's budget, the budget of the Department of HUD, is to keep that budget authority at a flat level of $11.3 billion. What would happen if that occurred? Very simply, 1.3 million families or elderly or disabled would have to be kicked out of section 8 housing over the 10-year period. We do not have the budget authority, we do not have the funds, to continue supporting those residents who depend upon section 8 housing. That, to me, is a major problem. We have been forced, out of necessity, to defer $4.2 billion in section 8 assistance until 2001. 
   While we have adopted this proposal--some would call it a gimmick--let's say, because everybody seems to agree on it, this necessary budget tool for the year 2000, we have done so unwillingly and with the great concern that this will create a nearly untenable budget hole for next year, 2001, when we have to fund section 8 contract renewals by an increase of some $8 billion, for a total of $14 billion. 
   In fiscal year 2000, some $6.8 billion was needed for section 8 contract renewals, but in 2001 we have to make up the $2.2 billion in advance appropriations. So we are going to have to find some way to get an additional $6.8 billion and still defer the budget authority for outlays in future years to those future years. 
   I am extremely worried about how HUD is handling this very complicated and difficult problem. We understand that HUD has underestimated renewal needs for this year and is close to running out of section 8 renewal funds. We are very concerned that we will not be in this position when that happens next year. 
   The problem is, as I said in my opening statement, that HUD is a high-risk area designated by the General Accounting Office, the only Department so designated. HUD's management deficiencies are particularly acute in the section 8 area. 
   Part of the problem is that HUD loses some $900 million per year in its public and assisted housing programs due to fraud and abuse in the collection of rent in the assisted housing program. If HUD and its agents were able to collect this $900 million, some 135,000-plus additional low-income families could receive section 8 assistance annually. That is why we have added $10 million in this budget for the inspector general to hire outside professional help to try to identify where those funds are being lost and to find some means of recovering those because that is a tremendous loss. 
   Let me explain another problem. A major problem with section 8 is, while section 8 is one of the most important Federal housing programs, it is not a panacea for providing affordable housing for low-income families. While vouchers do provide choice in housing for low-income families, the fair market rent restriction is currently set at the 40th percentile of the housing market, and therefore it severely curtails housing choice. As a practical matter, this has created market distortions in the availability of section 8 housing, leaving many low-income assisted families in very-low-income neighborhoods living in substandard housing. 
   In a number of areas, families with vouchers are unable to 
   use their vouchers to obtain affordable housing. I am told in St. Louis County their public housing authority has to release 100 vouchers to get 50 vouchers that are actually used because half the people who are given the vouchers cannot find housing. The lack of choice can also result in de facto redlining. 
   HUD has also suggested that incremental vouchers will mean the construction of new low-income housing units. I disagree. There is absolutely no evidence that incremental 1-year section 8 assistance will ever leverage construction funding. When we went from the 15- or 10-year down to 1-year, we took away the financing incentives and the basis for constructing low-income housing to fulfill section 8 needs. 
   I agree with HUD in that we do not have enough low-income housing units.  We need to develop a housing production program with deeper targeting than the low-income housing tax credit program. This should be a theme in the next Congress. We need to continue to fund HOME and CDBG, which are used by communities to provide additional housing. We need the additional funds we put in section 202 housing to build housing for the elderly. We need to continue to work with organizations that are present in every State, and which we celebrated in Missouri on Monday with the 100,000th home through the Enterprise Foundation. Enterprise, Enlist and others are building affordable homes. Habitat for Humanity does a great job of rebuilding homes. 
   But, frankly, there are many problems with the availability of affordable housing that go far beyond the availability of incremental section 8 vouchers. We have not identified the means to pay for the section 8 vouchers that we have already. Unless and until we do, I fear it is a hollow promise, to add incremental vouchers when we cannot assure that those people who now have them will be able to continue to get the vouchers and continue to get that housing assistance in the future. 
   I assure you, this committee, and I believe everybody in Congress, wants to continue them. We are going to do everything we can to assure renewal, but right now it is a huge financial and budgetary task. We do not have the answers on how we are going to do it. Before we start adding incremental housing, I ask that somebody sit down and work with us on how we will pay for them next year, the year after, and the year after. 
   We are going to be revisiting this issue frequently on the floor. I wanted to give that background so people will know what I am talking about when I say we have a tremendous wave of needs coming in for budget authority for section 8. We do not have the money. There is no projection we are going to get it. Before we continue to increase that outyear bow wave, we need to have some assurance we will be able to fund it. 
   I yield the floor.

   I am sorry that it appears we are not ready to do so. 
   I renew my request to all Members who have amendments. We welcome the opportunity to look at them. On some of these amendments, we find we can work them out in a way that is very easy to accommodate the reasonable requests of our colleagues. We want to do so in every possible way. But as I believe we have said many other times, we are facing a real time deadline. 
   We need to get this measure passed out of the Senate, I hope, no later than tomorrow. Then we can go to conference committee and get it back and send the conference report to the President prior to September 30 so this measure will not have to be included in the continuing resolution. To do so would relieve a tremendous amount of burdens from the agencies that are covered and would certainly move forward the work of this body. We have had good discussions, and we have had very helpful discussions from a number of Members who have not offered amendments. We are not looking for more amendments, but if there are Senators who have either colloquies they wish us to include or amendments they wish to offer, we would be happy to consider them at this time.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words the Senator from Nevada shared. We did appreciate working with the Senator on these very important bills. I thank him for his interest. 
   With respect to the new vouchers, I believe I have already addressed at some length why we have not recommended any new vouchers. We do not have the resources identified to maintain the ones we have. In fact, there are $40 million worth of additional vouchers for the disabled. We put in $100 million for the Opt Out Program to protect the residents in section 8 housing where the landlords are choosing to get out of the program. We are also working through HOME and CDBG to provide additional housing facilities. I have stated those points before. I will not reiterate them at any length. 
   With respect to community builders, we will address this in conference. The bill would terminate HUD's Community Builders Program for all external community builders. We were originally told there were supposed to be about 200 staff. It is now up to 800. The program represents about 9 percent of the HUD staff. In fiscal year 1999, HUD is expecting to spend as much in funds for staff and support costs for this program as they will spend for the HUD's community planning and development staff, which is responsible for administering programs such as CDBG and the homeless. 
   I believe investing in 2-year terms for employees hired out of the normal practices of HUD is a questionable use of scarce resources. What does it say about the capabilities of existing HUD staff when the Secretary says we have to bring in people who are hired for a 2-year term outside of the normal hiring practices to explain HUD programs? It says something is going 
   on. 
   Before the community builders' staff was hired, the roles were not adequately defined by HUD. It is still in the process of developing and defining the role, even though most of the positions have been filled for several months. According to the information we have from the IG, 76 percent of the external community builders' initial hiring was not in accordance with Federal selection rules. The hiring appeared to be political despite the assurances to the contrary. 
   The FHA Commissioner in charge of the multifamily housing has written:  
   Community Builders in certain areas have misinterpreted or overstepped their role in dealing with HUD's identified multifamily projects.  
   In his letter, the Commissioner states:  
   It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Community Builders must communicate with the appropriate HUD staff.  
   In my view, community builders are not acting as HUD staff. They are acting in the capacity of lobbyists or public affairs representatives for HUD.  HUD already has a public affairs office. The public affairs office is providing the direction to these people. The Department recently directed the community builders to reach out to the media to voice strong opposition to the House of Representatives appropriations fiscal year 2000 budget. I can state that they are also reaching out to lobby Congress to keep the community builders. I don't need to fund a group of people whose job it is, in addition to all the other normal functions of HUD, to lobby me and tell the news media how valuable they are when they are only on for 2 years and, according to the information we have, have not even in some instances been able to define the job of HUD and the roles and the programs of HUD adequately. 
   I don't believe there is an amendment pending. We will have more to say about that at length if it is brought up in the form of the amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both sides. There had been great concern in the Chicago area about the realignment of the VA facilities. This measure simply assures appropriate procedures are followed so all parties involved have an opportunity to express themselves. 
   This has been a longstanding concern with the VA. We do believe they should continue to move forward, as we said before, in closing unneeded facilities. But in doing so, it is vitally important they go through the proper processes which allow those affected to have a say and a stake in the process.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Ohio on his staunch support and advocacy of the programs at the Glenn Space Center. Because of his very strong advocacy, we included funds for the future launch program and other things that we think are vital to the long-term interests of NASA. We expect those programs will go forward. My view is, I am willing to accept this amendment and the additional amendment he proposes to ensure that NASA preserves the integrity of the mission of the Glenn Space Center.  
   Having said that, I have some problems. The amendment, if finally adopted into law, would be too constraining and might result in unintended consequences. We need to call NASA's attention to these problems but also give them needed flexibility that might not be there. 
   That said, I expect NASA to operate in good faith in maintaining the programs at the Glenn Space Center. This is critical. I expect NASA can resolve the concerns of Senator DEWINE so these provisions can be dropped in conference. I might note for my colleagues, the Senate report for NASA already states that ``each NASA center be vested with specific responsibilities and activities.'' 
   I think we are all moving in the same direction. I believe the Senator's admonitions included in this amendment that will be accepted here should suffice. 
   So I urge we accept the amendment. I will urge we accept the second amendment as well.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his very moving comments. I agree with him that we need more housing. I stated earlier my concerns that section 8 is not providing more housing. This is a long-term problem on which we must work. There are many challenges in the section 8 program, not the least of which is, as I said earlier, being able to continue the section 8 assistance for those who have it. So I will not pursue this discussion any longer. We will have an opportunity to do so tomorrow. 
   I believe we are winding up. 
   Mr. President, I do have one other amendment I would like to offer which simply calls on the GAO to conduct a study of possible revisions to the capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and report to the Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this act. 
   I am sure everybody is looking forward to having another study from GAO.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand on his selection to serve as Director General of the World Trade Organization. Dr. Supachai, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce, has been an unfailing advocate for the principles of free trade and is an excellent choice to lead this organization. I am very pleased that our faithful friend and ally, the Royal Kingdom of Thailand, will have one of their citizens guiding an international organization. 
   The agreement reached will split the next term between Dr. Supachai and Michael Moore, the former Prime Minster of New Zealand. As many of my colleagues know, the process for selecting a new Director General was at a standstill for months. Renato Ruggerio of Italy, the first and very successful Director General, finished his term and stepped down at the end of April. Despite the fact that his departure was known well in advance, no consensus on a successor was formed and the post remained vacant at a critical time--the Seattle round of trade talks being on the immediate horizon. Most of the countries of Europe and Asia have been united in their support of Dr. Supachai while the administration has supported Mr. Moore. The agreement reached by the member nations will permit Mr. Moore to serve a three year term to be followed by a three year term for Dr. Supachai. 
   For those of you unfamiliar with Dr. Supachai's work, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce, his most pressing responsibility has been developing policy to guide his country through their current economic challenges. This included taking a significant role in shepherding important banking and regulatory reforms through the Thai Parliament that are important to the sound economic foundation of his country. The IMF has reported good news for Thailand on the economic front. After experiencing an economic contraction of 8% in 1997, their economy is expected to grow this year by 2-3% with an expected growth rate of 5% in 2000. Their currency, the baht, has stabilized and the government has rebuilt reserves to higher than pre-crisis levels. This is very good news and a positive sign for an economic recovery for all of Asia. 
   Dr. Supachai was also one of the architects of the economic policies that led his country to merge as a dynamic economic engine in Asia and experience several years of phenomenal economic growth. As Minister of Commerce he has been active in opening the business sector to foreign participation and improving transparency. He helped create the country's Export-Import Bank and has worked very closely with the countries of Southeast Asia in creating the ASEAN free trade zone. In Thailand, he was a strong voice in forging public acceptance of the Uruguay round of trade talks and guiding ratification of the treaty through the Parliament. Throughout the economic crisis, Dr. Supachai's support for free trade has not waivered. His credentials on the issues important to leadership at the WTO speak volumes. 
   I believe it is important that an individual representing Asia and a developing economy has an important role in a prominent international organization, as Dr. Supachai will have. There are over 400 million people living in Southeast Asia alone, this region will soon be the second largest market for our exports. This region and all of Asia are growing in importance to our economy and security. A strong voice representing the Asian economies is overdue. 
   The economic collapse in Asia, Russia and other nations did not simply stifle growth of U.S. exports, it put millions of people out of work in these countries, exacerbated the poverty level and in some cases led to social upheaval. Unfortunately, it caused policy makers in many foreign nations to question the pace of globalization and in some cases question the wisdom of globalization. Many countries believe that they have little to gain through  expanding trade and everything to lose and that their stake in trade negotiations is limited. I do not agree. Increasing fair trade has contributed greatly to improving the standard of living of Americans and sustaining the growth of our economy and it holds the same potential for our trading partners. 
   While this is an unfortunate development, it is not one without a solution. The solution is working with individuals like Dr. Supachai who believe in expanding trade and working to improve the role and the economies of developing nations. Rather than being an after thought, we must begin to work with more nations if more are to believe that they have a role in globalization. For the global trading structure to succeed and prosper, all countries must have faith in the trading system and faith that trade deals are being reached to the benefit of all member nations rather than just the most powerful. Dr. Supachai is uniquely suited to facilitate such change and his increased role in the international stage is a very positive development for the World Trade Organization. 
   Finally, I believe the people of Thailand could have been treated better by the United States in this process. They are our good friends and faithful allies. We on the other hand were slow in selecting a candidate and did not do a good job in forging a compromise. Despite Dr. Supachai's strong advocacy of the principles of free trade, we actively worked against him. Fortunately, groups such as the US-ASEAN Business Council and companies like Boeing were outspoken on Dr. Supachai's strong record on trade issues. This lack of leadership does not enhance the credibility of the WTO and needlessly strains relationships with our friends. But I am confident that the new leadership, Mr. Moore and Dr. Supachai, can overcome these obstacles and look forward to working with them on these issues. 
   So once again, I congratulate Dr. Supachai on his appointment. He is very strong on promoting expanded trade and I am confident that a leadership role for a representative of a Southeast Asian nation is a positive development for the World Trade Organization. I would like to commend the people of Thailand for their persistence and not backing down in their support of their candidate. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Moore and wish him the best; he is taking control of the organization at a critically important time. I look forward to working with both of these gentleman on the issues that are important to advancing free and fair trade around the world.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment requires a study of mining in the Mark Twain Forest to address the scientific gaps identified specifically by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey on behalf of the Forest Service, EPA, and others. While the information is collected, it delays any prospecting or withdrawal decisions for the fiscal year. 
   It does not permit mining, prospecting or weaken environmental standards. It preserves the long-term requirements of a full NEPA process, which will ultimately dictate whether additional mining will occur. 
   The opponents seem to have an argument not with me but with the administration scientists who have concluded that there is insufficient information. The bipartisan county commissioners of the eight counties in the area are unanimous and adamant in their support. I met with the representatives of the 1,800 miners whose continued livelihood in this poor area depends on the opportunity to continue to mine. They want a hearing held in Mark Twain country.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment, as the manager has already stated, deals with a matter that was approved in the committee and was taken out by a procedural move. The amendment requires a study of mining in the Mark Twain National Forest in south-central and southeast Missouri. It requires that it be conducted to address the scientific gaps identified by scientists in the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and others. 
   While the relevant information is collected, the amendment delays any prospecting or withdrawal decisions for the fiscal year. 
   This amendment is a commonsense amendment. It is a modern amendment. It enables the full-blown process to go forward before any decisions are made. 
   This amendment does not permit mining. It does not permit exploration. It does not amend, weaken, or touch environmental standards. 
   It prohibits exploration and withdrawal. It requires a scientific study of the scientific gaps identified by the agencies. It maintains the NEPA requirement for full-blown environmental impact statements which any withdrawal by the Secretary would preclude. 
   This amendment preserves, as I said, the requirement of the full-blown NEPA process. And a full-blown impact statement will ultimately dictate whether any mining should or should not take place if an application is made, if there are deposits of lead discovered. 
   By the time any mining could take place, Senator THURMOND might be the only Senator remaining in this Chamber. 
   The amendment does not give miners their way who want clearance for prospecting now. 
   It does not give the zero-growth opponents their way. Contrary to precedent and current law, they want no economic activity on these public lands which are multiple-use lands in the State of Missouri. 
   Anyone who understands this issue understands that bulldozers are not ready to roll, nor should they be. They don't even know yet what lead might be available. There are too many unanswered questions to make a final decision. Regrettably, some on the extreme want to preclude an opportunity to answer those questions. 
   The fundamental question that this amendment addresses is whether someday, if we were to find lead in those areas, additional lead could be mined safely in the State of Missouri. That is a critical question and that is one that should be answered by the scientists. 
   We are not here to legislate a decision and it should not be hijacked by administrative decree. 
   Some suggest that we know enough already to make what would be a permanent decision for the 1,800 miners who are under the gun for the 10 counties in south Missouri that depend upon this mining. They say we know enough already to prevent any further mining in an area which has 90 percent of the domestic lead deposits. So we would export lead production overseas. 
   This past month I met with the bipartisan county commissioners, Democrats and Republicans, who are elected by and responsible to the people in the counties they serve. They make up the Scenic Rivers Watershed Partnership. They are closest to the issue. They have the most at stake. They are the ones who represent the recreational interests. They are the ones who represent the timber interests. They represent the forest interests. They represent the interests of schools and roads which depend upon the royalties that come from mining. And they support this amendment. They said we must have a full-blown study. 
   There is a technical team that has been set up. 
   A multiagency technical team was established in 1988. It has the USDA Forest Service, the National Park Service, EPA, U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources Division and the Geologic Division, the Mineral Resources Division, the Mapping Division, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and the Department of Conservation. It has the private companies involved; it has the University of Missouri, Rolla; and it has the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   What do these scientists and engineers who have begun the study say? 
   First, they say:  
   The technical team believes that there is insufficient scientific information available to determine the potential environmental impact of lead mining in the Mark Twain National Forest area. This is a consensus opinion that the technical team has held from the beginning through the present. Due to the lack of scientific information available to assess the potential impacts of lead mining, the technical team proposed that a comprehensive study be conducted.  
   That is contained in a letter to me dated July 30, 1999, from Charles G. Groat, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, the Office of the Director, the  U.S. Department of the Interior in Reston, VA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is further backup and supportive information that I can provide. But, in summary, my amendment provides the money for the research that the technical team says it needs, and it preserves the current rigorous environmental process which will take years to complete. If lead is discovered, if it is economically viable, and if the company decides to develop a mining plan and apply for mineral production, then the whole process will have to start. 
   To vote for this amendment is to vote to let the scientists get what they say is necessary to make an informed decision, and it is a consensus of all of those agencies I outlined that they don't have the information. I think it is also a strong consensus of all the agencies that we must protect the environmental resources of the region. 
   As one who has floated and fished on the streams in the Mark Twain National Forest, I can tell you that it is a real gem. I flew over much of the area and I visited on foot much of the area in the last month. I can tell you that it is a beautiful wilderness. But it is a multiple-use area. It is used for recreation; it is used for timber; it is used for mining. We flew over some 160 exploratory drilling sites. But you don't see them because they grow back. As a matter of fact, I had my picture taken in one of the exploratory sites. 
   There is an exploratory site 2 years after the exploration stopped. It is growing back. In another few years you won't even be able to tell it is there. 
   That is why the scientists said that exploratory drilling has no impact. So it is not even an issue. It has no environmental impact. That is not a problem. 
   There are those who do not live in the area who say that no economic use can be made. But I believe that for the good of the country, for the good of the area, to satisfy our needs, to provide the work for 1,800 miners in the area, to provide the support for the schools, for the communities, for the roads and infrastructure in the area, we must follow the long established, rigorous evaluation process designed to allow environmentally acceptable activities and prohibit those that would be adverse to the environment. 
   If you listen to the scientists, as we have, you know that it takes more information than is currently available to make that determination. These questions deserve to be answered before we mine, or before we slam the door in the face of the regions' residents and force our country to become exclusively reliant on foreign sources of this vital mineral. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is a commonsense amendment.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I rise in support of the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 (H.R. 1568). This bill is a critical building block in our efforts to provide significantly improved help to small businesses owned and operated by veterans and especially those small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. This bill was approved by a unanimous vote of 18-0 in the Committee on Small Business after the Committee approved a substitute amendment that I offered with the Committee's Ranking Member, Senator KERRY. 
   Over the past two years, as the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have brought three bills to the Senate floor that place a special emphasis on helping veteran entrepreneurs. The need for this legislation became necessary as Federal support for veteran entrepreneurs, particularly service-disabled veterans, has declined. Significantly, support for veteran small business owners historically has been weak at the Small Business Administration (SBA). 
   The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 seeks to provide assistance to veteran-owned small businesses to enable them to start-up and grow their businesses. The bill places a specific emphasis on small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans and directs SBA to undertake special initiatives on behalf of all veteran small business owners. 
   H.R. 1568 has key provisions that are of particular importance to veterans. The bill establishes a federally chartered corporation called the National Veterans Business Development Corporation (Corporation/NVBDC), whose purpose is to create a network of information and assistance centers to improve assistance for veterans who wish to start-up or expand a small businesses. The Corporation will be governed by a board of directors appointed by the President, who will take into consideration recommendations from the Chairmen and Ranking Members from the Committees on Small Business and Veterans Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives before making appointments to the board. Although funds are authorized during the first four years of the Corporation, it is the expectation of the Committee on Small Business that it will become self-sufficient and will no longer need Federal assistance after this four year start-up period. 
   In an effort to make its programs more readily available to veteran entrepreneurs, the SBA is required to ensure that the SCORE Program and the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program work directly with the Corporation so that veteran entrepreneurs receive technical support and other needed assistance. 
   H.R. 1568 places special emphasis on credit programs at SBA that can be helpful to veterans, and especially service-disabled veterans. The bill specifically targets veterans for the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program, the 504 Development Company Loan Program, and the Microloan Program. 
   A key component of H.R. 1568 is to make Federal government contracts more readily available to service disabled veterans who own and control  small businesses. The bill includes an annual goal of 3% of all Federal contract dollars for these small business owners. This goal is seen as an incentive to Federal agencies to undertake a major effort to make their procurement activities more accessible to veterans who made major sacrifices for our Nation. 
   During the markup of H.R. 1568, the Committee approved a requirement that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) collect data to be reported annually to Congress on the number and dollar value of contracts and subcontracts awarded by Federal agencies to veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. This new requirement is critical if we are to measure the success of Federal agencies in meeting this 3% goal. 
   Last year, the Committee on Small Business approved new initiatives to strengthen the mandate that SBA's programs be more responsive to all veteran small business owners. The ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998'' (H.R. 3412) directed that veterans receive comprehensive help at SBA. This bill passed the Senate unanimously in September 1998; unfortunately, it was not taken up by the House of Representatives before the adjournment in the fall. The bill would have elevated the Office of Veterans Affairs at SBA to the Office of Veterans Business Development, to be headed by an Associate Administrator who would report directly to the SBA Administrator. This provision is contained in H.R. 1568. 
   In addition, H.R. 3412 would have established an Advisory Committee on Veterans' Business Affairs comprised of veterans who own small businesses and representatives of national veterans service organizations. The bill also would have established the position of National Veterans' Business Coordinator within the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) Program. This new position would work within the SBA headquarters to ensure that SCORE's programs nationwide included entrepreneurial counseling and training for veterans. Both initiatives from H.R. 3412 are included in H.R. 1568. 
   More recently, on June 6, 1999, the Committee approved the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999 (S. 918) to assist military reservists called to active duty and the small businesses that employ them. This bill complements the provisions of the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act. Accordingly, the Committee voted unanimously to incorporate the full text of S. 918 into Title III (Technical Assistance) and Title IV (Financial Assistance) of H.R. 1568. 
   During and after the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990's, the Committee heard from reservists whose businesses were harmed, severely crippled, or even lost, by their absence. These hardships can occur during a period of national emergency or during a period of contingency operation when troops are deployed overseas. To help such reservists and their small businesses, H.R. 1568 authorizes a deferral of loan repayments on any SBA direct loan, including a disaster loan, for an eligible small business. SBA is authorized to reduce the interest rate on the direct loans. 
   SBA is also directed to publish guidelines within 30 days of enactment of the legislation to help its lending partners in the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program and the 504 Development Company program to develop procedures for providing loan repayment relief to small businesses that have been adversely affected by the departure of an essential employee to active military duty. Further, the bill establishes a low-interest economic injury loan program to be administered by the SBA through its disaster loan program. The purpose of these loans will be to provide interim operating capital to a small business that suffers substantial economic injury as a result of the departure of its essential employee to active duty and cannot obtain credit elsewhere. 
   Mr. President, I have also introduced a non-controversial amendment to H.R. 1568, which would require the President, rather than the SBA Administrator, to appoint the voting members of the board of directors of the National Veterans Business Development Corporation. Senator KERRY has cosponsored this amendment. This change was requested by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Small Business. It is my understanding that with the adoption of this amendment and Senate passage of the H.R. 1568, as amended, that the House of Representatives is prepared to take up and pass the bill later this evening. 
   We have an opportunity today to approve an excellent bill to help veteran small business owners, and I urge my colleagues to support both my amendment and the bill.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from Ohio for his hard work on this very important bill. The work our nation's poison control centers do is absolutely essential to the safety and health of our children. Not only do poison control centers save lives, they significantly reduce our health care costs by helping American families deal quickly, safely, and efficiently with a poisoning emergency.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to prevent a potentially harmful conflict that has come to our attention as we implement the new HUBZone program adopted in the Small Business Reauthorization Act. It appears this program doesn't quite mesh properly with the procurement of grain products in the Food for Peace program funded in this bill, and I offer this amendment to prevent the major economic disruption that could occur between now and the time we are able to correct this glitch in authorizing legislation. 
   The HUBZone program is a valuable new tool I was able to put together as Chairman of the Small Business Committee. It provides competitive advantages for small businesses located in economically distressed areas as they seek to obtain government contracts. If these small businesses agree to hire 35 percent of their employees from these distressed areas, they become eligible for a 10 percent price evaluation preference in bidding on contracts awarded through free and open competition. The law also provides for certain contracts to be set aside exclusively for competition among HUBZone small business concerns, as well as sole source contracts. 
   As we implement this program this year, we are occasionally running into situations where the program doesn't quite fit with existing law and other programs. We are working to resolve these issues in a manner that we hope will be as consistent as possible with both the intent of the HUBZone law and those other programs. 
   When the government purchases agriculture products for the Food for Peace program, those purchases are a procurement within the meaning of the government's's small business procurement policies, including the HUBZone program. Some products like corn soy blend are procured with a mix of both small business set-asides and full and open procedures. In this particular case, 10% of the corn soy blend is purchased as a set aside for small business and 90% is purchased through full and open competition. 
   Corn soy blend has only a handful of about five vendors, only two of which are small businesses. They would be the only ones allowed to compete for the small 
   business set-aside. Only one of those two small businesses is a HUBZone small business, however. That HUBZone vendor would also be eligible for the 10 percent price evaluation preference in full and open competition. It could bid up to 10 percent more than the other vendors and still be deemed the lowest bidder. For a product like corn soy blend, operating on narrow price margins, this 10 percent preference is likely decisive. 
   This means that this one HUBZone small business could lock up 90 percent or even 100 percent of the entire market for corn soy blend.It would do so as a matter of law, not simply because it produces the best product at the best price. We could accidentally create a monopoly by government action, thanks to the way these various programs come together in this particular type of procurement. 
   I can say as Chairman of the Small Business Committee, this is not the outcome we intended. We are not here to create monopolies, even if the monopoly is currently a small business. The small business program seeks to expand small business opportunities and foster competition, not stifle it. 
   That's why I have offered this amendment. This amendment does not alter any of the existing programs--Food for Peace or HUBZones. It just says, let's not create a monopoly between now and the time we are able to adopt corrective legislation in the next  small business reauthorization bill, which is due next year. I'm sure we can fix this problem appropriately. But in the meantime, contracts for corn soy blend will continue to be awarded, and it is possible the market may have been converted into a monopoly in the short run. 
   My amendment says that no funds will be used in this bill to award HUBZone contracts for Food for Peace commodities if the award would exceed the actual production capacity of the successful HUBZone small business. The amendment places a similar limitation on Food for Progress procurements of commodities, which are procured in a similar fashion. CCC procurements of non-commodity items--such as desks, computers, office supplies, and the other apparatus needed by any Government agency--would not be covered by this amendment. 
   This means that a HUBZone small business would not be allowed to lock up the entire market, collect the HUBZone benefits, and then subcontract the actual contract performance to another firm. The business would be limited by the amount of commodity it could deliver on its own. This prevents an abuse of the program that could create a monopoly position for a HUBZone small business, unfairly threaten the livelihoods of its competitors, and unnecessarily drive up costs for the taxpayers. 
   I should note also that this doesn't lock out anybody, including small businesses that I hope will in fact take advantage of the HUBZone program. It just prevents an abuse of the HUBZone program while we put together a long-term fix that reflects the particular circumstances that prevail in commodities procurement. 
   I would note also that I anticipate this will be necessary only for this year. I know the managers of the Agriculture Appropriations bill sometimes get a little frustrated at the number of general provisions that get inserted into this bill, and many times these provisions tend to be carried over from year to year. In this particular case, we seek only to prevent market disruption in the interim until we tackle this in the small business reauthorization that will be due next year. Thus, I think this provision will be only for the Fiscal 2000 bill that is in front of us. 
   This should be a non-controversial amendment, and I hope it can be cleared by unanimous consent. My staff and I are available to answer questions for anyone needing clarification on this.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I and the several members of this Subcommittee have spent a considerable amount of time working to ensure that other nations do not unfairly discriminate against genetically modified crops grown by American farmers. These crops hold great promise for eliminating hunger in the developing nations of the world. In addition, advances in biotechnology will lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides, improvements in soil quality and many GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) crops have documented health benefits. It would truly be a disaster for the people of those nations--as well as for farm families in this country--if the benefits of these products are lost because of unsound science or straight up protectionism. 
   We are all aware of the problems that we face in opening markets for these products in Europe and many of my colleagues are aware that we face new labeling requirements in Japan. What many of my colleagues may not realize is that the same groups that are fighting these products in Europe are funding similar efforts to stop the introduction and consumption of GMO products in developing countries around the world--some of the very countries that stand to benefit the most from these products. The opponents are now turning their attention to a key U.S. market--Southeast Asia. This area of the world is home to a half billion consumers and the income levels are well above those in countries such as India or China. Unfortunately, the GMO opponents are busy at work to keep us from competing fairly in the markets of Southeast Asia. 
   In Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and other countries in the region, American producers are facing a real threat of closed markets due to the efforts of non-governmental groups based mostly in Europe. This is a very important time in the region as a number of governments are studying how to and whether to regulate genetically modified organisms. As governments are reviewing the issues, it would be a tremendous mistake to allow the GMO opponents to go unanswered. As a government, we should be making every effort to assist our farmers and producers in educating government officials in these countries as to the sound scientific reviews that have been conducted on these products and the extensive regulatory approval process that the products are subjected to in the United States. Unfortunately, it appears that our federal government resources are completely tied up in fighting what some consider to be more pressing battles around the globe. 
   My staff and I have been in contact with the Administrator of the Foreign Agriculture Service, Tim Galvin, several times in the past few months urging him to dedicate a relatively modest amount of funding--$80,000--for the FAS to take internationally-respected scientists to countries throughout Southeast Asia so that they may meet with government officials and scientists who are working to address the GMO regulation issue. It is essential that we move forward with such education efforts to counter the rhetoric and the scare tactics of the NGOs. Several of the countries in this region are proceeding towards implementing regulatory schemes; if we do not take affirmative action on this front we stand to lose valuable markets. Despite the critical need for moving forward with such a program now, I have been unable to get Mr. Galvin to agree to this important program. 
   I also understand that there is a plan to eliminate the regional FAS position in Singapore, which is dedicated to working for biotechnology acceptance throughout Southeast Asia. Such a move would be a terrible mistake. Singapore is in many ways the gateway to the ASEAN region--which will overtake Japan as the second largest market for U.S. products and services by the year 2005. The Agricultural Trade Office's work with the ASEAN Secretariat towards establishing an ASEAN regional trade regime based on sound science and its work with the Singapore regional traders must continue if U.S. agriculture is successfully to realize this region's market potential. We should be focusing on improving and bolstering this office rather than eliminating it at a time when these countries are beginning to work on these important issues. 
   I know that the chairman of the Subcommittee shares my concern about these issues. I urge him to join me in calling on Mr. Galvin and other officials at USDA to move to address the need for the U.S. to become engaged on this issue in Southeast Asia and to fund these important programs.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues on the other side. Yet the President's budget devastates veterans' health care. The flat-line budget proposed by this administration will result in some 13,000 Veterans Affairs employees being RIF'd or furloughed. It will close down facilities. It will throw people out of the care of the veterans facilities. 
   The problem is that this motion does nothing to get money to veterans. This body has already gone on record saying we do not want to stay at the low level submitted by the President. That is why we are going to increase by hundreds of millions of dollars in the appropriations bill the amount we spend for veterans' health care. We are concerned about veterans' health care. That is why we are not going to tolerate the unforgivably small budget that the President has proposed. This is an attempt to provide appropriations when, in fact, it will have no such impact. There is $505 billion set aside in this plan for spending on high-priority matters. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order against the amendment under section 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds that it is not germane.

   Mr. BOND. I too thank the Chairman for his assistance in this matter. DEA's participation in fighting the methampetamine epidemic is essential to state and local law enforcement. As my colleague stated, the DEA provides training for local officers that well prepares them to handle and dispose of the toxic material that they encounter while busting clandestine methamphetamine labs. The DEA also has an important role in the clean up process. There were over 800 clandestine methamphetetamine labs seized in the State of Missouri last year. Most of the labs were busted in rural areas and smaller towns. These towns have police forces and sheriffs offices of a very limited sizes. DEA's presence and help in rural areas is essential to ensure that these communities are not overwhelmed by the drug and the havoc in this wake. If this menace is to be brought under control, local law enforcement must have the assistance of the DEA. The Senator from New Hampshire has been a good friend to Missouri law enforcement as he has worked closely with us in recent years to ensure that the DEA has the resources to focus on this problem and I appreciate him clarifying the use of those designated funds.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, for their initiative to allocate $2.5 million in the Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill to fund the research function of the Office of Advocacy at the Small Business Administration. This is an increase of $1.1 million over the amount in the President's FY 2000 budget request for SBA. 
   The Office of Advocacy, which is headed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, performs an essential role acting as the eyes, ears, and voice from within the Federal bureaucracy on behalf of the small business community. One key responsibility carried out by the Office of Advocacy is the research it conducts on issues critical to small businesses. It is our understanding that $500,000 of the additional funds for the Advocacy research function are targeted toward the review of interpretative regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury and rules issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator KERRY about the failure of SBA to allocate adequate staff to the Office of Advocacy. This shortfall has placed an enormous burden on the ability of the Office to fulfill its mission. While I would encourage the SBA Administrator to allocate staff for the Office of Advocacy at the 1990 level, I realize they may not be able to make such an large increase in one year. Therefore, I would like my colleagues on the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, to clarify their intent for the increase in the FY 2000 budget for the Office of Advocacy.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been very encouraged in recent days by the peace offensive initiated by the new government of Ehud Barak in Israel. The people of Israel long for peace. The new Prime Minister, in his first few days in office, has been energetically trying to lay the groundwork for a secure, lasting peace in the Middle East. I applaud his efforts and trust that Prime Minister Barak's actions will be fully discussed and carried forward in his upcoming talks in Washington during the next week. 
   While I applaud these steps toward peace, I also believe it is imperative that, at the same time, Israel remain militarily strong. The only way a durable peace will be successfully negotiated and maintained in this dangerous but vital region of the world is if Israel deals from a strong hand. Even if Israel is successful in reaching an accommodation with its closest neighbors, it will continue to face very serious strategic threats from Iran, Iraq, and Libya for the foreseeable future. 
   To counter these terrorist states which possess weapons of mass destruction and lie within easy striking distance of Israel's homeland, it is critical that Israel have an effective strategic strike capability that will provide effective deterrence. To do this and to move simultaneously forward in implementing the Wye River Agreement and pursuing peace initiatives with its neighbors, Israel will need more military assistance funding for aircraft purchases from the United States. 
   In this regard, I recently came across a thoughtful Lexington Institute Issue Brief, authored by well-known defense strategist Loren Thompson, ``Bolstering Israel's Strategic Air Power Serves America's Interests.'' In this essay, Dr. Thompson argues that helping Israel to increase it military strength at this time not only will help Israel and further Middle East peace but also help protect America's interests in the region, especially since the  US may have less access to bases in the region and more threats to American security interests in the future. 
   Dr. Thompson states, among other things, that:  
   It (Israel) needs enough money to buy and equip 15 more F-15's for a total force of 40........Making such a purchase would nearly double the Israeli Air Force's capacity for long-range strikes........The US economic and political interest in the Middle East-Persian Gulf region will continue to grow in the years ahead (and) Israel is the only stable, reliable US ally willing to take the necessary risks. Congress and the Clinton Administration need to equip it (Israel) so that it is ready when the time comes.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   As we near the end of this debate, I want to share a few thoughts generally on the proposals we are discussing. Quite frankly, we just had an opportunity to see the amendment which has been offered. Our crack Senators are reading it over to study the measure. They will shortly have comments to offer on that. 
   I want to talk about some areas that I think have become very obvious as we have moved forward in this debate. The first thing we ought to emphasize is that both sides are going to deal with the managed care problems and concerns. We have heard from patients in our States. I have heard a lot of rhetoric and a lot of name-calling about what the various bills do. The simple fact of the matter is, the people of Missouri, the folks who talk to me, the people who are concerned about health care--the small businesses are particularly sensitive--have some things they don't want to do. 
   The first rule of medicine is to do no harm. They want to make sure we don't make it worse. I believe the amendments we have adopted and the direction in which we are going will make the situation better. We are going to assure patients in a managed care plan, if they are turned down for coverage, they can go to a physician for an external appeal, and thanks to the very wisely crafted provision of the amendment offered by my colleagues--Senator ASHCROFT, Senator KYL, and Senator ABRAHAM--if the managed care organization doesn't provide them with that coverage of services that the external appeal said they are entitled to, they will be able to go out and get it someplace else and bill the HMO. 
   What we are saying is, we don't want to give people a lawsuit, a cause of action or, even worse, give their widow or their orphans a cause of action. We want to give them health care. We want to give them a treatment. We want to give them a treatment, not a trial. We want them to make sure they can get health care. That is the important point. That is what the provisions we have adopted do. 
   One of the things we don't want and one of the things our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to want is another bureaucratic nightmare. Do we really want to turn the regulation of our health care system over to the Federal Government, to the bureaucrats at the Health Care Financing Administration? I say not. We have had a lot of experience with HCFA, and it has not been good. 
   The Republican bill is based on the premise that States can do a good job monitoring what is going on in the world of managed care, they can do a good job of deciding what is the appropriate legislative response. Some may do better, some may not do as well. But the nice thing about the laboratory of States is that we can see which States are doing the best job and we can change the law. 
   During my time and service in State government, we worked on assuring better regulation. The States will move  forward. My State has passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. Most States have. They are looking to see how it works. The States that make it work the best are going to be followed by others. 
   The Democratic bill, the Democratic approach, is based on the premise that States can't handle managed care regulation and that Federal bureaucrats are better equipped to do it. The Democratic bill will overturn a host of State laws and replace them with the interpretations of the Federal Government 
   employee. These are the same bureaucrats who produced one nightmare after another in trying to impose their regulatory monstrosities from Washington. Now they want the entire health care system turned over to them. 
   We have already had examples of HCFA's failures related to the issue of consumer protection, the very topic that the Democrats want to turn over to HCFA lock, stock, and barrel. Back in 1996, we entrusted HCFA with more responsibility when Congress passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill designed to make sure health care was portable. How well did HCFA handle this responsibility? According to the General Accounting Office, HCFA admits they pursued a Band-Aid, minimalist approach for protecting consumers. 
   The GAO has another finding that HCFA ``lacks the appropriate experience or expertise to regulate private health insurance.'' These are the people to whom we want to turn over regulatory responsibility for the entire health care system? When they are entrusted with the entire responsibility, when they are incompetent or mess up, the whole country suffers. 
   One of the things I have done as chairman of the Small Business Committee is to try to ensure that Federal agencies live up to the requirements of the law passed in this body and the other body unanimously to reduce redtape, to make sure that Federal agencies take into account how their activities and their regulatory actions would impact small business. We found there were several agencies that weren't doing a very good job. The regulatory process was clogged up. 
   I initiated the ``Plumber's Friend Award'' to unclog the regulatory pipes in these agencies. Needless to say, HCFA and the Department of Health and Human Services were one of the first. We give these awards to Federal Departments which blocked the flow of public participation because they failed to reduce unreasonable and burdensome regulations affecting small business. HCFA and HHS qualified for the award by repeatedly disregarding Federal laws designed to make it easier for small businesses to deal with the massive amounts of regulation and paperwork required by Federal bureaucrats. 
   That is an example of the nightmare HCFA is creating. We saw the nightmares. They were going to impose surety bond requirements on home health care agencies, many of them small businesses in my State. HCFA decided they were going to require the small business home health care agencies to purchase surety bonds that would cover up the Federal Government's mistakes. In other words, they had to provide insurance so if the Federal Government made a mistake, the surety bond would be responsible. A home health care operator told me with tears in her eyes she couldn't raise the money to buy a surety bond. 
   Then they imposed cuts on the home health care agencies that have been putting them out of business left and right. Under the Balanced Budget Act, they were supposed to save $16 billion a year over 5 years. They cut back on the amount of reimbursement so much that they would wind up saving $48 billion a year. They were imposing a system of reimbursement that penalized the good providers, that penalized the providers who were providing the most intensive care in the home. They were penalizing the providers in the most difficult areas--precisely the kind of service we want to keep. 
   HCFA has had a bad track record. Ask anybody who has had to deal with HCFA, and they will say, whatever the problem is, HCFA is not the answer. 
   There are some who think that maybe our colleagues really want to get back to the era of another health care proposal that came from the White House. Known as Clinton Care, the 1993 health care plan was going to be a Federal takeover of health insurance. The wisdom of the Federal Government was going to run health care. 
   Senator GRAMM has done a good job this week talking about some of the possible horror stories that could and would have happened if we passed the Clinton health care bill. Fortunately, we didn't. Some of my colleagues are running around saying they personally helped kill the Clinton health care bill. That sucker wasn't killed by any Republican. It died of its own weight. The Democratic majority leader didn't even bring it up because once they looked at it, they said, this thing isn't going to work. It was dead on arrival. 
   Let me state some of the likely results had we adopted the President's proposal to socialize medicine. 
   Expensive mandates on the Nation's employers would have cost jobs, insurance premiums that would likely skyrocket. It would create 50 new Federal bureaucracies, a new trillion-dollar Federal entitlement. These were the items we would have received.

   Mr. BOND. The bottom line is we would have had 1,200 pages of mandates, rules, requirements, and penalties. It died. But let me remind my colleagues what the President said just a couple of years ago, in September 1997. Talking about his failed effort to impose this failed health care bureaucracy on the American people, he said:  
   If what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it another way. That is what we tried to do, a step at a time until we have finished.  
   That is what I am afraid of. That is what we were trying to do, to get to the point where we had socialized health coverage in the United States. 
   Costs are clearly a problem. Costs are going to be a lot more than $2 million, or one Big Mac, $2 a month or one Big Mac a month, as some of my colleagues on the other side have said. If you have a $2,600-a-year family health insurance program and you have a 5-percent raise, it is a whole lot more than $2 a month. It is about $180 a year, something similar to that. It is a lot more. And when costs go up, people lose their health insurance. 
   We need to fix some of the problems. We need to do it without driving people out of the system. We already have 40 million uninsured people in America. I can tell you one thing that is clear: small businesses are very much concerned about ensuring they do not get priced out of the ability to compete by their health insurance costs.

   Mr. BOND. It talks about small businesses in Kansas City, MO, getting health insurance coverage. But the costs are still the problem, and there are examples of people who are trying to provide health care coverage, but when the costs continue to go up, then they have to drop it. They are fighting over $5 a month. Some of the people who wanted to provide health care for their employees figured they could not afford $1.35 an hour in addition which, on a 2000-hour-a-year job, would come out to around $2,700. They aren't able to afford the increased cost of insurance. 
   If we drive the costs of health insurance up, we are going to find people who cannot afford it. We are going to find employers who drop it. Particularly, if we give the employee the right to sue their health care plan or their employer, as my friends on the other side wish to do, they are not going to provide it. 
   We need to make health care better, more affordable, more accessible. We do not need to drive people out of the health care system. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the opponents of this amendment overlook the fact that the States are involved. The States do regulate health insurance. The States are taking care of those they can cover. 
   This amendment says we should not wipe out State regulation. It also completes the job of ending the tremendous inequity in our health care system which said formerly that self-employed people could only deduct 25 percent of their health insurance premiums. Thanks to the bipartisan support we have had, we say now, by 2003, that there will be 100-percent deductibility. Right now, however, there are 5.1 million uninsured, 1.3 million children. For the woman who is starting a new business, the fastest growing sector of our economy, she starts up an information technology business and she is not able to deduct 100 percent of health care insurance for herself and her family until 2003. She cannot afford to wait to get sick until 2003. 
   I urge my colleagues to support immediate deductibility.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma. In a gesture of goodwill, I ask that the Chair notify me when 13 minutes is up because I would like to hear a full minute from the Senator from Oklahoma. I very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss the amendment that the Senator from Oklahoma has addressed and sent to the floor. 
   First, let me put into context some of my views about the competing Patients' Bill of Rights. I happen to be very proud to be a supporter of the majority or Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. I am proud to be one of 50 Senators who cosponsored the majority bill, and I will be proud to vote for the legislation. 
   As with anything we do up here, there are probably some ways you could say it is not perfect. But I believe it is the best approach we have before us that places reasonable controls on managed care companies, while also helping rather than hurting access and coverage problems. 
   That is something that is extremely important to many Americans--having access and getting the coverage they need. 
   When we look at the competing proposals, I think it is good to drop back to the first rule of medicine, which is do no harm. I am stunned that with the bill offered on the other side, described as helping patients, we are faced with the fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office and others, that  over a million people who have health insurance today probably can't afford it tomorrow, and that thousands more who were thinking they would be able to get insurance would see that opportunity snatched away if their bill, which would drive up costs, were to pass. 
   I wonder how anyone can support such a backwards proposition that we are willing to price people out of health care in the name of helping them. That is a fatal flaw, as I see it, in the Kennedy plan: too much cost; too little gain. 
   In contrast, our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus contains basic, reasonable, commonsense patient protections; access to emergency room care for which their health plan will pay. Americans shouldn't have to worry that their insurance won't pay for necessary emergency room care. Our bill guarantees that patients have information on treatment options. Doctors and patients need to be able to discuss openly all possible treatment options without gag rules. 
   Our bill provides access to a quick, independent, expert appeals process. Patients should get the care they need when they need it. There has been a lot of talk on the other side about how we need to open up the courts for more costly litigation. Well, frankly, we don't want to see widows or orphans having to sue because their breadwinner did not get the health care he or she needed. We want to make sure they get that care promptly, efficiently, and effectively. 
   I am very pleased that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus contains important pediatric and maternal health care protections, which I introduced earlier this year in what we call the Healthy Kids 2000 legislation, which had broad support from major health care supporters, including children's hospitals and pediatricians, who are concerned about care for children. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus gives the right for a child to go see a pediatrician without going through a gatekeeper. It gives the right for a child to see a specialist with pediatric expertise, including going to children's hospitals when necessary. It gives the right to a woman to have direct access to an obstetrician or gynecologist without having to go through some gatekeeper. It gives the right to have a pediatric expert review a child's case when appealing an HMO decision. In other words, somebody who treats kids will be the one who will oversee the decision and be able to participate in the external review as to whether the kind of care the HMO proposes for a child is appropriate for that child. 
   But just as important as what is in our Republican bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, is what isn't in it. It doesn't contain the same costly bureaucratic provisions the Democratic bill has. One would have thought they would have learned something when we had the health care debates of 1993 and 1994, the Clinton plan, which had the Federal Government and its bureaucracy controlling health care. When people took a look at that dog and found out how mangy it was, it failed, not because the Republicans beat it, but because nobody was willing to get out and support it--and with good reason. The more people looked at it, the worse it looked. 
   Well, the Congressional Budget Office has given estimates that the Democratic bill could raise health care premiums anywhere from 5 to 6 percent, depending on which version of the bill we are discussing. I have heard people on talk shows saying that is one Big Mac a month. Five percent of basic family health insurance at $3,600 a year--my math suggests that is a whole lot more than a Big Mac a month. We are talking in the neighborhood of $180 a year. 
   CBO and others have told us that for every 1 percent increase in costs, a couple hundred thousand people will lose health care insurance. Under this bill, that means, under the Democratic version, over a million Americans or more could lose their health care coverage. 
   I speak as chairman of the Committee on Small Business because cost increases for small businesses and small business employees is a No. 1 concern. We have listened to small businesses, and we have heard from small businesses. They say: Please don't do us any more favors. Don't burden us with more costly health care plans. Small businesses are fighting to try to get economical, caring, compassionate, effective health care for their employees and for the business owners themselves. Small business owners are particularly sensitive to the issue of 
   cost. Small businesses--the owners and their families, the employees and their families--would be the ones who would pay for an extravagant bill. 
   Nearly 40 years ago, President Kennedy told the Nation that a rising tide would lift all boats. Unfortunately, the bill before us turns that concept on its head, and perhaps a new doctrine is that rising costs will sink health care hopes. To me, that is a major concern. 
   As an alternative to this heavyhanded bureaucratic approach, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, offered by the Republicans, tries to increase access and coverage. Now, it is extraordinary and unconscionable that the bill we are debating, the Democratic bill, doesn't do anything to improve access to health care. It seems that the only thing our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can think of to improve access is to have Government-run care, like the Clinton health care plan of 1993 and 1994. Since that fell on its face a few years ago, they seem not to have had any good ideas about how to get more people health insurance. 
   We need to increase access. Perhaps the most important part of our bill is the acceleration of the full deduction of insurance costs for the self-employed. I am very pleased that our distinguished majority whip, the Senator from Oklahoma, has introduced an amendment that achieves, for this year, full deductibility of health care costs. That means there is hope that the health care premiums paid this year will be fully deductible. 
   Now, my colleagues, the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Alabama, have already discussed the importance of keeping insurance regulation at the State level. As a former Governor, I can tell you that government insurance regulation, run at the State level, is readily accessible, it is more professional, and it is more responsive to the needs of the citizens. That is why I agree with the portion of the amendment introduced by Senator NICKLES which talks about moving away from Federal Government takeover of health care regulation. 
   But I am particularly pleased that Senator NICKLES has introduced full deductibility based on the Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of 1999, which I introduced on February 3 of this year. I am very proud to have 30 bipartisan cosponsors. We are making progress when we work on a bipartisan basis to assure full deductibility of health care costs for the self-employed. I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   According to the Employment Benefit Research Institute's estimates of the March 1998 current population survey, there are 21.3 million Americans in families headed by a self-employed entrepreneur. Nearly a quarter--23.9 percent--of them have no health insurance. That is 5.1 million uninsured Americans. Even more troubling, that means that the 21.1 percent of the children in self-employed American families are uninsured; 1.3 million children have no coverage for annual checkups, let alone any major health care needs. 
   This amendment would address these alarming statistics by providing an immediate--I mean right now, in real time--100 percent deductibility in order to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to hard-working entrepreneurs and their families. 
   Let me add an additional perspective on the importance of this amendment. Today, one of the fastest growing segments of 
   the small business community is the woman-owned business. Women are opening businesses at a very rapid rate. They are the ones with the entrepreneurial spirit. They may be operating out of their homes, they may be moving from another full-time job, or they may just have a good idea. But women are now seeing an opportunity to start up their own businesses, and we are very proud of the significant contributions they are making to our economy. 
   According to statistics from the National Foundation for Women Businessowners, there are now 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the United States, which compromise almost 38 percent of all U.S. businesses.  In addition, between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103 percent nationwide--more than double. The reasons for this explosive growth are manifold. Topping the list is greater flexibility in meeting the demands of family life, and the ability to spend more time with children. 
   Even more impressive, the National Foundation for Women Business Owners reports that women-owned businesses employ more than 27 1/2 million people, and that employment rate has increased by 320 percent over the past 12 years. 
   Today, while self-employed woman business owners can deduct 60 percent of their health care costs thanks to the strides that we made in previous years, that is still not on a level playing field with a large business which can deduct 100 percent. 
   While the self-employed are slated to have full deductibility in 2003, what woman business owner or her family members can wait 4 more years to get sick? 
   By making health-care insurance fully deductible now, the added tax savings will enable many women business owners to cover their health-care needs and those of their children. In addition, it will encourage these women entrepreneurs to provide health insurance for their employees and their families. 
   And we're not talking about a tax break for ``the rich'' when it comes to the health-insurance deduction for the self-employed. Recent estimates based on the March 1998 Current Population Survey indicate that 68.7 percent of families headed by a self-employed individual with no health insurance earn less than $50,000 per year. 
   These are the people who we are trying to get health coverage. These are the people who need the benefit of full deductibility. 
   Coverage of these entrepreneurs and their children through the self-employed health-insurance deduction will enable the private sector to address the health-care needs of these individuals rather an expensive and intrusive government program. 
   Currently, S. 343, from which my amendment is derived, has the bipartisan support of 30 cosponsors. It also enjoys overwhelming support of small business organizations including the National Association for the Self-Employed, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Small Business Legislative Council, the National Small Business United, and the Health Tax Deduction Alliance, to name just a few. 
   I have also added a provision to the amendment to correct a disparity under current law that bars a self-employed individual from deducting any of her health-insurance costs if she is eligible to participate in another health-insurance plan. This provision unfairly affects entrepreneurs who are eligible for, but do not participate in, a health-insurance plan offered through a second job or through a spouse's employer. The bill ends this disparity by clarifying that a self-employed person loses the deduction only if she actually participates in another health-insurance plan. 
   It has long been my goal that the self-employed have immediate 100 percent deductibility of health-insurance costs. I have sought every opportunity to achieve that goal, and I will keep coming back until we get this job done. 
   I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for pushing for this amendment on the bill so that we can have bipartisan, unanimous support for the effort to ensure that all Americans who are self-employed will have the same kind of benefits in terms of taxes that a large corporation or its employees do; and that is 100 percent deductibility. 
   I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I ask all of my colleagues to join in supporting a very forward-looking amendment which deals with some of the significant problems in the underlying bill offered by our colleagues on the other side and makes significant changes to assure access to fair and equitable health care insurance for all Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Independent Office of Advocacy Act. This bill has been drafted to build on the success of the Office of Advocacy over the past 23 years. It is intended to strengthen the foundation to make the Office of Advocacy a stronger and more effective advocate for all small businesses throughout the United States. 
   The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal government. It is part of the Small Business Administration (SBA/Agency), and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the Office is also intended to be the independent voice for small business within the Federal government. It is supposed to develop proposals for changing government policies to help small businesses, and it is supposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses before other Federal agencies. 
   As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the independent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also a part of the President's Administration. As you can imagine, those are sometimes very difficult roles to play simultaneously. 
   The Independent Office of Advocacy Act is designed to make the Office of Advocacy and Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent advocate within the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small business community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless of the position taken on critical issues by the President and his Administration. 
   The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the Independent Office of Advocacy Act will be unique within the executive branch. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy will be a wide-ranging advocate, who will be free to take positions contrary to the Administration's policies and to advocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact small businesses. 
   In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be the eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal government. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy is the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly believe that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy should be independent and free to advocate or support positions that might be contrary to the administration's policies, I have come to find that the Office is not as independent as necessary to do the job adequately for small business. 
   For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the Salaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated by the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall staff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time employees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of Advocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-board as the result of the hiring freeze imposed by the SBA Administrator. The Independence of the Office is diminished when the Office of Advocacy staff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for new programs and additional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the discretion of the Administrator. 
   In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently completed a report for me on personnel practices at the SBA (GAO/GGD-99-68). I was alarmed by the GAO's finding that Assistant and Regional Advocates hired by the Office of Advocacy share many of the attributes of Schedule C political appointees. In fact, Regional Advocates are frequently cleared by the White House personnel office--the same procedure followed for approving Schedule C political 
   appointees. 
   The facts discussed in the GAO Report cast the Office of Advocacy in a  whole new light--one that had not been apparent until now. The report raises questions, concerns and suspicious regarding the independence of the Office of Advocacy. Has there been a time when the Office did not pursue a matter as vigorously as it might have were it not for direct or indirect political influence? Prior to receipt of the GAO Report, my response was a resounding ``No.'' But now, a question mark arises. 
   Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my efforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy in all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small businesses. However, so long as the Administration controls the budget allocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the independence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this situation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small business community. 
   The Independent Office of Advocacy Act builds a firewall to prevent the political intrustion into the management of day-to-day operations of the Office of Advocacy. The bill requires that the SBA's budget include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No longer would its funds come from the general operating account of the Agency. The separate account would also provide for the number of full-time employees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer would the Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA Administrator to hire staff for the Office of advocacy. 
   The bill also continues the practice of allowing the Chief Counsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of Advocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures directed by federal law and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). I beleive this special hiring authority, which is limited only to employees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it allows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best assist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems confronting small businesses. 
   Mr. Presdient, the Independent Office of Advocacy Act is a sound bill. The bill is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review and consideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small Business, representatives of the small business community, former Chief Councels for Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted much time and effort in actively participating in a Committee Roundtable discussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my Committee held on April 21, 1999. It is my hope the Committee on Small Business will be able to consider the Independent Office of Advocacy Act in the near future.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to applaud my colleagues in the Senate and our friends in the House of Representatives for acting promptly to negotiate a conference report on the Y2K Act. As chairman of the Committee on Small businesses, I have paid particular interest to the small business community's concerns about the Y2K problems. While the ultimate consequences that will result from the Y2K problem are as yet unknown, small family-owned businesses are understandably concerned about their futures after the new year. They are concerned that their companies may be in danger either from the problem itself or from suits brought by trial lawyers concerned only with the fees they can obtain from settlements. 
   These businesses have reason to worry that they will be bankrupted by never-ending litigation. Small, woman-owned and family-owned businesses are the most vulnerable from costly litigation, either as plaintiffs or defendants, because they do not have the time to devote to it and do not have excess revenue to afford it. In addition, small businesses do not want to sue companies with which they have long-standing relationships and whose survival is tied to their own. Yet, these vulnerable businesses see the looming specter of endless litigation on the horizon. 
   Experts have estimated that total litigation costs related to the Y2K problem will be astronomical. For example, the Gartner Group, an international consulting firm has estimated that more than $1 trillion will be spent on Y2K litigation. Therefore, this legislation, by encouraging resolution of Y2K disputes outside the courtroom and decreasing the number of frivolous lawsuits that small businesses may have to face, will help to ensure that litigation arising from this problem will not devastate the millions of small businesses that are the engine of our nation's economy. 
   The small businesses that are troubled about the prospects of Y2K litigation are located on Main Streets all across America, not just Silicon Valley. They are this country's mom and pop groceries, its dry cleaners and its hardware stores. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the nation's largest small business association, strongly supports this legislation. The NFIB surveyed its members and found that an overwhelming 93 percent support capping damage awards for Y2K suits. The small business community is speaking with a unified voice in support of legislation to limit the impact of Y2K suits for the good of this nation and by voting for the conference report today we are not ignoring this voice. 
   The conference report also contains an important amendment that was adopted in the Senate sponsored by Senator GREGG and co-sponsored by me. While the underlying bill will ensure that small businesses do not face financial ruin from costly litigation, the amendment will make certain that our own government does not bankrupt small businesses over the Y2K problem. This amendment will waive Federal civil money penalties for blameless small businesses that have in good faith attempted to correct their Y2K problems, but find themselves inadvertently in violation of a Federal regulation or rule, despite such efforts. 
   Most experts that have studied the Y2K problem agree that regardless of how diligent a business is at fixing its Y2K problems, unknown difficulties are still likely to arise that may place the operations of such businesses at risk. The last thing this government should do is levy civil money penalties on small businesses that find themselves inadvertently confronted with Y2K problems. Many of these businesses will already have had their operations disrupted and may be in danger of going out of business entirely. The Gregg-Bond amendment in the conference report ensures that the Federal government does not push them over the edge. I urge all my colleagues to support the conference report for the sake of our country's small woman- and family-owned businesses and to ensure that the economic health of our nation is not imperiled by the Y2K problem in the coming year and beyond.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to introduce the Save My Home Act of 1999. This legislation is intended to provide a blueprint for HUD to address the problem of owners opting out of the section 8 program by not renewing their section 8 project-based contracts. This is a housing crisis. In my state of Missouri alone, section 8 contracts on over 23,000 units will expire over the next 5 years. Nationwide, section 8 contracts on over 14,000 multifamily housing projects with over 1 million units will expire over the same period of time. 
   The ``Save My Home Act of 1999'' will restate and reemphasize the need for HUD to use its best efforts to renew all expiring section 8 project-based contracts. The bill also provides new authority for section 8 enhanced or ``sticky'' vouchers to ensure that families in housing for which owners do not renew their section 8 contracts will be able to continue to live in their housing with the Federal government picking up the additional rental costs of the unit. The use of sticky vouchers is intended as a last resort. HUD must push for the renewal of the section 8 project-based contracts first. The bill also focuses on appraisals so that the cost of this housing reflects the true market value of the rental units. This has been a huge problem and will continue to be a problem until HUD develops the capacity and expertise to appraise adequately these multifamily housing projects. 
   This legislation is needed because HUD has, until recently, refused to renew section 8 project-based contracts at market levels. In response to this policy, many owners of this housing have refused to renew their section 8 contracts and the housing has been 
   converted to market rate housing and lost as affordable, low-income housing inventory. This means that the assisted low-income families in this housing often have to move because the new rents will be too high for the section 8 rental subsidies. This is a huge problem, especially for the elderly and for persons with disabilities who have come to see this housing as their homes. 
   And this has become a crisis. For example, according to the National Housing Trust, during 1998 alone, owners of 219 properties with some 25,488 units section 8 units voluntarily opted out of receiving federal rental subsidies under the section 8 project-based program. Moreover, it has been estimated that we are losing another 3,000 section 8 units a month because of HUD's inaction. I wish we had better numbers but HUD is not providing us or the housing advocates with this information, and it is not clear that HUD even has this information. 
   However, I do want to be clear about the parameters of section 8 opt-out crisis. HUD currently has the legal authority to renew expiring section 8 contracts at the market rent, but has failed to implement this authority. Congress in the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, as enacted on October 27, 1997 in the VA/HUD FY 1998 Appropriations bill, provided HUD with the authority to renew section 8 contracts up to the rental market level. This was almost 2 years ago, and HUD has only announced recently a renewal policy that it has not yet been able to implement. And despite press releases to the contrary, I am not convinced that HUD intends to renew these contracts except with an additional push from the Congress. 
   I also want to be clear about funding. HUD has enough funds to pay for section 8 contract renewals, even though HUD would have you believe otherwise. In particular, HUD has at least $2 billion in the Housing Certificate fund in excess of what is needed for renewing all expiring section 8 contracts this year. Instead of committing any of these funds for the renewal of section 8 project-based contracts, HUD has dedicated these funds as part of its FY 2000 budget for general section 8 contract renewals. Nevertheless, this money is available now and can be used to renew these expiring section 8 contracts. The real problem is that HUD does not have the ``will'' or ``commitment'' to fund these contracts. In fact, the biggest problem is commitment because you cannot legislate commitment. We need to find a way to make HUD renew these section 8 project-based contracts. 
   HUD's lack of commitment to section 8 project-based housing has been a problem through this Administration. From the start, both HUD and the Administration have had a stated policy of opposing section 8 project-based assistance in favor of vouchers. And this is true whether we are talking about elderly housing, housing for persons with disabilities, or housing that is located in very low vacancy areas, such as rural areas where there is no available housing or high-cost urban areas like Boston and San Francisco. This has been a problem in the past with the Section 202 program and with the Mark-to-Market inventory. 
   One final point is that I know there is interest in both the House and Senate in funding a grant program to assist in the sale of section 8 projects to nonprofits and tenant groups. While I support the concept of selling section 8 projects to nonprofits and tenant groups, I am troubled by the thought of buying projects that the Federal Government has already paid for several times over. This program sounds like another reiteration of the preservation program which we misguidedly funded over several years through the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, resulting in fraud and abuse as we vastly overpaid the value of these projects when we could have been using those funds for more fiscally responsible, affordable housing purposes. 
   I look forward to working with interested Members of Congress on these very important issues.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators CHAFEE, ROCKEFELLER, REED, MOYNIHAN, BREAUX, CONRAD, JEFFORDS, MIKULSKI, and LANDRIEU to introduce the Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999. This important piece of legislation will provide transitional assistance for the estimated 20,000 youths in the United States who ``age out'' of the foster care system at the age of 18 without a permanent family. 
   This legislation builds on the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children (PASS) Act that I co-sponsored in 1997. The Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 increases the funding for the independent living program in order to provide basic living needs, such as housing and food. Additionally, the increased funding provides states the option to grant Medicaid for health care, including mental health needs, to former foster children up to their 21st birthdays as a condition of receiving the increased funding. 
   This legislation also guarantees that state programs are well supervised and provides a wide range of support which focuses on health, safety, and permanency goals. In addition, the bill allows children who receive aid under the independent living program to have assets or resources totaling $10,000, in contrast to the old requirement of $1,000, which deterred foster children from saving money for a sound future. 
   Mr. President, at age 18 foster care children are suddenly expected to be adults, able to take care of themselves. That is not a reasonable expectation, especially for kids deprived of a nurturing parent or other caring adult. As these youths age out of foster care without a permanent family or a structure of continued support, many lack a high school education, have difficulty maintaining employment, and often experience high levels of depression and discouragement. Research has proven that a significant number of homeless shelters users had recently been discharged from foster care. Other studies found that former foster care youth 2 1/2 to 4 years after they ``aged out'' of foster care found that 46% of the youths had not completed high school, approximately 40% were dependent on public assistance or Medicaid and 42% had given birth or fathered a child. 
   Mr. President, I know first hand how this legislation can impact our nation's foster care children. In my home state of Missouri, Epworth Children and Family Services, in St. Louis, provides resources needed to help people who fall through the cracks of a system that is not strong enough to help build a future for foster care children ``aging out'' of foster care. Robin, an 18-year-old foster care youth, was all alone in the world when she entered Epworth's Independent Living Program. Her father was never a part of her life and her mother was serving time in jail. Motivated by the desire to regain custody of her two-year-old baby boy, Robin started the program with high hopes. However Robin struggled as she worked with the caring staff at Epworth. Despite attempts by the professional at Epworth to stretch limited resources to address Robin's ongoing needs, their system failed Robin. She was removed from Epworth by the Missouri Division of Family Services. Robin needed more support, more staff interaction and more resources than the Epworth program could provide. 
   Mr. President, the Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 provides significant assistance to assure that these foster care youth who ``age out'' of the system are provided with the assistance needed to transition out of foster care into independence. The provisions in this bill will assist these youth to begin a supervised and nurtured life outside of the foster care system. They will be given the time and resources they need to enter adulthood prepared. This independent living initiative would give many ``Robins'' the change to be self-sufficient and to contribute to her community. This means a better life for all of our children.

   Mr. BOND. In the last couple days, a lot of people have been talking about the Medicare program and what we want it to look like as we think far ahead into the future. I'm glad this is happening, because this is an important debate. We do need to discuss things like a prescription drug benefit, comprehensive Medicare reform, the long-term solvency of the program, and other related issues. 
   But as we focus on the future of Medicare, we also need to do our best to make sure that the existing program is working as well as it can. That's why we're here today. Part of the existing program-- the home health care benefit--is completely broken, and we've come together to try to fix it. 
   Why do we care? Well, home health care is the key to fulfilling what is virtually a universal desire among seniors and those with disabilities--to remain independent and within the comfort of their own homes despite their health problems. For people who have difficulty leaving their home and who have health conditions that require low- to mid-level medical attention, home health care is a tremendous help. Home health care keeps these people out of more expensive and less comfortable settings such as nursing homes and hospitals. And home care is often the only source of care for many disabled individuals and frail elderly, especially those living in underserved rural and urban areas of our country. Simply put, home health is crucial to millions of Americans' comfort and health, and we must make sure they continue to have access to it. 
   The problem is that more and more Americans do not have access to needed home health services--they simply cannot find a home health agency that will care for them. This means they will either not receive the care they need, or that they will get this care, they'll just get it at more expensive and intimidating facilities like hospitals or nursing homes. This is the crisis we are facing. 
   I would like to take a moment to describe several different ways this home health crisis is rearing its ugly head across the country. 
   First, we have seen literally thousands of home health agencies close their doors in the last two years. Perhaps as many as 2,000 of the 10,000 agencies that existed in 1997 have either been driven out of business or out of Medicare. In Missouri alone, about 75 out of 300 home health agencies have closed since 1997, including the well-respected and well-established Visiting Nurse Association of Greater St. Louis. A few of the agencies that have closed have no doubt been shady characters we should be glad to see go. But many--and perhaps most--of the agencies that have closed are legitimate providers with real patients. 
   Second, those agencies that have survived have had to change drastically the way they operate. Many have been forced into layoffs and cutbacks in other areas that directly or indirectly impact patient care. Many face chronic cash flow problems and may be forced to refund large amounts of cash to the Health Care Financing Administration--perhaps in the hundreds of thousands of dollars--that they accidentally received because they had not yet been informed of the new ground rules for home health payments. Because of the bizarre incentives against caring for patients with the most complex cases, many home health agencies have also been actively managing the types of patients they care for, trying to avoid or discharge costlier patients. 
   All of this is bad for patients, and it will likely get worse. Without Congressional action, it may never get better. I truly believe that without significant changes, home health services within Medicare could practically disappear. Home health services would theoretically still be part of the Medicare program, but few if any people with Medicare would be able to receive care in their home simply because there will be nobody there to provide it for them. 
   The Medicare Home Health Equity Act--which I am introducing today with Senator COLLINS and 12 other colleagues--responds to this crisis and attempts to save home health care within the Medicare program. 
   This bill addresses a variety of payment and regulatory issues, all of which have impeded or prevented home health agencies from providing high-quality, efficient care. Two provisions are particularly critical. 
   First, as I have mentioned, home health agencies currently have little incentive to provide care for sicker and costlier patients. In fact, because more complex patients put an agency at risk of exceeding the annual per patient budget that is now in place for each home health agency, there is actually an incentive not to care for sicker patients. The result--which shouldn't be a surprise--is that home health agencies are actively trying to avoid these sicker patients, either leaving them without care or leaving them to check in to a more expensive health facility such as a nursing home or a hospital. 
   The Medicare Home Health Equity Act solves this problem by creating a system of ``extra'' payments for sicker patients--sometimes these are called ``outlier'' payments. Under this plan, home health agencies would be assured from the start that they could receive extra payments for patients who meet the criteria for ``sicker'' patients. This way, we can remove the incentive for home health agencies to try to deny care to seniors with complex cases. 
   The second crucial provision in the bill is something similar to a last-minute pardon from the governor. In addition to all of the problems they have faced in the last couple of years, home health agencies are scheduled to take another huge payment cut--about 15% of the total amount they receive from Medicare--in October of 2000. I fear that this cut would truly be the death-knell for the industry. We cannot allow this radical payment reduction to take place. 
   In addition to these core provisions, the Collins-Bond bill deals with a variety of payment and regulatory issues, all designed to make sure that Medicare recipients continue to have access to quality home health care and that the home health agencies are permitted to provide that care in an efficient manner. 
   I would like to commend Senator COLLINS for her leadership on this issue. I am pleased that we were able to develop a joint bill so that we could unite our forces behind one bipartisan legislative vehicle and one bipartisan solution. It is also encouraging to see that all of the national trade associations that represent home health agencies are supporting this bill. Finally, I would like to again thank this bill's cosponsors for supporting this effort and for helping to raise awareness that there is a home health crisis that desperately needs our attention in Congress. 
   I for one pledge to do my best to maintain seniors access to home health care. We cannot allow home health services within the Medicare program to disappear. It doesn't make sense for the patients, and it doesn't make sense for Medicare.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this weekend will be doubly special for the residents of McDonald County in my home state of Missouri. On March 3, 1849, McDonald county was established by the State Legislature and named after Revolutionary War hero Alexander McDonald. Not only will this weekend mark the 223rd anniversary of the founding of our country, but it is also the formal celebration of the 150th anniversary of the founding of McDonald County. 
   McDonald County has a distinguished history, including a gold rush in the last century. McDonald County was also the site for the filming of a 1938 movie about Jesse James starring Tyrone Power, Randolph Scott, and Henry Fonda. More recently, every Christmas the Post Office in the city of Noel receives thousands of cards to receive the stamp of ``The Christmas City.'' McDonald County is also a major economic force in the state of Missouri, ranking first in agricultural sales, due to their $50 million poultry industry. 
   I join the citizens of McDonald County in celebrating this milestone in their history. I take great pride in recognizing this historic event and wish McDonald County prosperity in the next 150 years that is even greater than the last. Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing the sesquicentennial of McDonald County.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I point out that over the last 6 years prior to 1998, the steel industry experienced 6 straight years of growth in domestic steel shipments. 
   In 1998, there is a downturn. There is a downturn because of the collapse in the Asian economy, because of the General Motors strike. That is unfortunate. We don't want to see those jobs lost. 
   When you talk about illegal dumping, there are laws against illegal dumping. They are being enforced and they are being enforced effectively. 
   What we are being asked to do in this bill is to put at risk the 20 production jobs for every one steel job; 20 production jobs depending on using steel for the one job in the steel industry. 
   That could be a disaster for our economy. 
   The chairman has already pointed out the cost to the taxpayers, to the consumers. In my State of Missouri, workers in agriculture, in the airplane industry, and small businesses would suffer a loss of jobs and a loss of opportunity if we adopted this measure. 
   I join with the chairman and the ranking member in urging we oppose this measure. 
   Mr. President, I offer a few other points on top of the excellent arguments laid out by my colleagues as to why this bill is a bad idea. 
   The reasons for the surge in steel imports and the decrease in employment in the steel industry are the result of numerous factors and complex conditions. There are a number of forces at work, but the difficult times faced by the steel industry are largely due to economic cycles and conditions. I believe that the industry is asking Congress to take action on its behalf to rectify a status caused by unfavorable conditions. We have a large and diverse economy, with many factors dependent on one another. Taking legislative action on behalf of one industry could have wide and profound ripple affects on may industries that are not for the better and would be a very unwise precedent. The reaction to this legislation could destroy jobs in Missouri industries from agriculture to airplanes and many others. 
   These conditions have not been receiving the level of attention that they deserve in the discussion as to whether erecting trade barriers is the proper approach, if there is an approach, to reducing the increase in steel imports. 
   The largest consumers of steel are automobile manufacturers and construction--two industries whose health is directly related to the health of the economy. We all are aware of the economic conditions facing the Asian nations, particularly facing Japan and the Southeast Asian Nations. This was a very sudden and dramtatic turn of economic fortunes. Previously, those economies had a voracious appetite for steel in the years proceeding their economic problems. The skylines of the Asian business capitals have been transformed from those of small towns into cosmopolitan metropolises rivaling many American cities. But today, the streets of Bangkok are littered with dozens of highrise construction  projects that have ground to a halt. Demand for steel overseas has collapsed. 
   Prior to that collapse, U.S. steel manufactures were enjoying good times. Indeed, a decline in domestic steel shipments was witnesses in 1998, but the decline, which was slight, came on the heels of six straight years of growth. The industry enjoyed good times, they benefited from the growth in demand, from the construction boom here and abroad. But economic upheaval abroad has had a major affect on demand, prices, productivity and profit. Capacity was moving along only to face an almost instanteous drop in demand. Those factors as having contributed to the drop in demand have been minimized. Another factor, the labor stoppage at General Motors last summer, has barely been mentioned. 
   Businesses endure business cycles. I have all the confidence that the industry will take the steps necessary to remain competitive, but taking this legislative action to address the conditions of one industry is unwise. Those factors have been minimized as contributing to the decline in demand around the world. Another factor, the labor stoppage at General Motors last summer, cannot be underestimated for its impact on demand and prices. 
   We are being asked to take legislative action to protect a single industry from conditions that are largely the result of the economy and their business decisions and planning. An act such as this cannot be taken without having severe and far reaching consequences for many other industries. As we have heard on the floor of the Senate, and their own business decisions taking legislative action that will benefit a single industry is a purely protectionist act. 
   Mr. President, we have made a commitment in this country to advancing freer trade and open borders. I believe it is in the best interest of our country and in the best interests of future generations. Trade has many benefits. The competition has led to dramatic improvement in the efficiency and the profitability of the domestic auto industry. It has led to improvements in the efficient and profitability of the domestic steel industry. Prior to the year 1998, shipments of steel increased for six straight years. I believe that growth will return. The benefits are seen all around us in the form of more efficient industries, cheaper products and better made products. 
   Trade also advances our standard of living. As we enjoy the benefits of this communications revolution, open markets will permit it to be prolonged. If other countries close down their markets, the avenues to continue to sell these products will begin to evaporate. There is no dispute the types of jobs that have been created because of this revolutions--they are high paying and highly skilled jobs, the type of jobs that have contributed to the continuing escalating standard of living in the United States. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to raise a problem relating to pharmacy compounding and a proposed Memorandum of Understanding from the Food and Drug Administration with state boards of pharmacy relating to compounding. 
   Pharmacy compounding is a part of the practice of pharmacy that involves specially-tailoring a prescription drug product for a specific patient's needs. A good example is when a pharmacist takes a pill prescribed for an infant--but which that infant can't swallow--and grinds it up and mixes it into a sweet syrup that the baby is happy to take. 
   Pharmacy compounding has been part of what pharmacists do for centuries, and it is important to preserve their ability to do this without huge regulatory hassles. Pharmacy compounding is important for many patients who need specially-designed drugs because no commercially-available product meets their specific needs. Interfering with compounding will only hurt these patients by making it more difficult to get--or even denying them--the specific pharmaceutical products they need. 
   But the Food and Drug Administration is now threatening to create problems for many pharmacists who do a lot of pharmacy compounding--which means problems for the customers they serve. The FDA has proposed a joint regulatory setup with states that calls on state Boards of Pharmacy to investigate pharmacists if more than 20 percent of the total prescriptions they distribute are compounded products sold out-of-state. 
   This proposal is supposed to guard against a handful of bad actors who are mass-producing drugs but are trying to avoid FDA regulation by saying they are actually involved in pharmacy compounding. The problem is that this proposed solution will also interfere with honest pharmacies and pharmacists who are legitimately engaged in pharmacy compounding. 
   Two types of pharmacists who are particularly at-risk of being hassled by this rule are pharmacies that are located in multi-state areas and pharmacists who specialize almost exclusively in pharmacy compounding and who are well-known for their specialty either nation-wide or region-wide. 
   Under the regulatory setup the FDA has proposed, these pharmacies are vulnerable to automatic state investigations or other regulatory actions, even if there is no evidence that they are doing anything but legitimate pharmacy compounding.

   Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman for that comment, and would like to bring up one specific example of the unnecessary problems this proposal creates. 
   Last week, I spoke to a woman from Kansas City, Missouri, who runs two separate pharmacies. One is a typical drug-store type pharmacy where you can go in to fill prescription drugs that came straight from the manufacturer. Her other pharmacy--which is legally separate--is exclusively involved in pharmacy compounding. The only thing this pharmacy does is specially-tailor prescription products for people in the Kansas City area. 
   The problem is that easily over 20 percent of her compounding customers are from across the state line in Kansas City, Kansas. She also suspects that many of these Kansas customers--although she's not sure exactly how many--live more than 50 miles away from her pharmacy, meaning she might not fit in the protections the FDA tried to include for pharmacies that are selling to out-of-state customers locally. 
   Because this pharmacy in Kansas City doesn't meet the somewhat arbitrary FDA guidelines, this woman could automatically be subject to an investigation by the state Board of Pharmacy, even though all of her pharmacy compounding is done legitimately for specific patients. 
   I just don't believe the FDA has done a good job writing these guidelines.  There must be a more sophisticated way to approach this problem that won't threaten legitimate pharmacies with unnecessary regulatory hassles. I believe Congress needs to take a stand on this issue to force FDA to reconsider their proposal.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, much of the discussion and debate in the Senate has focused on high technology and its impact on our everyday lives, particularly with regard to its pivotal role in our economy. We heard about the potential problems related to Y2K computer failures and the need to guard against unreasonable liability in the event that Main Street small businesses, through no fault of their own, become the targets of frivolous lawsuits. In short, we have been preoccupied with the dawn of the 21st century and what we can do to help sustain the robust economic growth that has been fueled by as many remarkable breakthroughs in computer technologies and computer-related services as we could possibly imagine. 
   Last Thursday, a new reality dawned when I saw a copy of a study on electronic commerce, or e-commerce as business conducted over the Internet is known. Many Members got a jolt from the story entitled ``Net's Economic Impact Zooms.'' A study shows $301 billion was generated in revenue in 1998, and it produced 1.2 million jobs. The findings were reported in the USA Today and were drawn from a study conducted by the Center for Research and Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas and Cisco Systems. 
   Frankly, I, too, was shocked but in good company because the figures exceeded the wildest expectations of the experts. To add a little more perspective from that study, consider that  from 1995 to 1998 the new Internet economy grew 174 percent, compared to the 3.8 percent growth in the world economy as a whole. The Internet economy alone ranked among the top 20 economies worldwide. More importantly, this awe-inspiring growth, packed into just a few short years, stands almost toe to toe with the economic horsepower generated by the Industrial Revolution. 
   The onslaught of e-commerce and the Internet puts us in the same position as the snail who was run over by a turtle. When interviewed about it, he said: It all happened so fast I never saw it coming. 
   We are working hard to see if we can work with small businesses to help them see it coming. E-commerce is leading a new business revolution, from Wall Street to Main Street. In my view, there simply is no more potent force at work in the economy with the equal potential to propel nearly every business into the 21st century. 
   As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, it is my pleasure to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take care of and to be concerned about whether small, independent, family-owned, and home-based businesses are adequately prepared to be full partners in the remarkable growth potential that the Internet economy holds. 
   Some folks may assume that the rapid development of new technologies has given Main Street America the tools to compete more effectively, but the unanswered question is whether the technologies readily available to small businesses are truly up to the challenge. 
   Yesterday, in the Senate Committee on Small Business, we held a forum entitled ``e-commerce: Barriers and Opportunities for Small Business.'' We had a blue-chip panel of experts in high-tech computer and software companies and business leaders representing over 20 trade groups to identify and target barriers keeping Main Street businesses from expanding into 
   e-commerce. 
   We were joined by several of the companies that are leading the charge in pushing back the rise of the Internet economy, including an Internet service provider from my home State of Missouri, Primary Network of St. Louis. 
   It was an exciting and informative session considering the potential growth e-commerce will undoubtedly spark for many years to come. One of the participating companies, CyberCash, unveiled new research specifically for yesterday's forum projecting e-commerce business will generate another million jobs over the next 2 years. Those are conservative estimates. 
   Another study from the firm, Cyber Dialogue, shows that many small businesses are already taking advantage of e-commerce-based markets. That study says over 427,000 small businesses added web sites and sold $19 billion worth of products and services over the Internet in the last 12 months, a 67-percent increase since early 1998. 
   Unfortunately, not all the news was good. According to the American City Business Journals and the Network of City Business Journals, only 10 percent of small businesses have a web site today and only 32 percent have access to the Internet. That suggests both a disconnect and, at the same time, an incredible opportunity for Main Street America and for the suppliers of the equipment and services. 
   What is more, we were reminded that for many small businesses you have to be prepared to deal with a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week business. Some small businesses have difficulty raising the capital and acquiring the knowledge to survive in such a dynamic business area. Research has shown that even major companies have been slow to realize the potential, and many are now working hard to regain market shares they lost. 
   Today, thanks to the cutting-edge expertise and the information provided at yesterday's forum, we are a little wiser about the Internet economy. We know that e-commerce can be economic TNT. I think Congress has a duty to make sure that as many independent, family-owned and home-based businesses as possible are not at risk of being left behind in this worldwide business revolution. 
   I am deeply grateful to the occupant of the Chair. His subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations has approved a $1 million earmark we asked for to allow the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy to begin a study of the potential of e-commerce for small business. We are going to ask the Office of Advocacy to develop a web site to help small businesses who want to do business with the Federal Government. 
   Make no mistake, the Internet economy is a train that has already left the station and it is picking up speed by the minute. I look forward to working with my colleagues, both in the committee and in this broader body, to help Main Street America climb on board. 
   I look forward to pursuing this effort. We are outlining just a few steps we will take on the Senate Committee on Small Business. We welcome ideas, participation and suggestions from other colleagues. We invite all Members of the Senate to join in making sure that the smallest businesses in the United States have access to this tremendous engine of economic growth. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Advanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri. 
   Back in 1997, several community and state leaders approached me regarding funding for the Advanced Technical Center, which at that time existed only  on paper and in the minds of these leaders. I immediately had a certain affection for this project. First and foremost, this project would be located in my hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Second, the local leaders came to me with one of the most comprehensive partnerships that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. The partners included Linn State Technical College, the University of Missouri, Moberly Area Community College, the Mexico Area Vocational and Technical School, the City of Mexico, and the State of Missouri. Third, the Advanced Technical Center would provide students with exceptional educational opportunities through highly specialized and advanced technical education and training at the certificate and degree levels in both emerging and traditional technologies. 
   In the fall of 1997, the Senate approved and the President signed the appropriation bill providing $1 million in Federal funds for the Advanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri. The federal support recognized that the key to staying competitive in today's global marketplace is investing in education and training of our current and future workers. The federal funds, in conjunction with the local and state funds, made this project a reality. 
   This Friday, June 18, 1999, the Advanced Technical Center will celebrate its Grand Opening. I am looking forward to being a part of the celebration. But, more importantly, I am proud to have been a participant in the successful partnership that has led to the creation of a model, state-of-the-art technical training and learning facility in my hometown of Mexico, MO.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the amendment to the Y2K Act sponsored by Senator GREGG and which cosponsored. This is an important amendment that will waive Federal civil money penalties for blameless small businesses that have in good faith attempted to correct their Y2K problems, but find themselves inadvertently in violation of a Federal regulation or rule despite such efforts. Most experts that have studied the Y2K problem agree that regardless of how diligent a business is at fixing its Y2K problems, unknowable difficulties are still likely to arise that may place the operations of such businesses at risk. This amendment will ensure that the government does not further punish small businesses that have attempted to fix their Y2K problems, but are nevertheless placed in financial peril because of these problems. 
   As chairman of the Senate Committee on small Business, I have paid particular attention to the problems that small businesses are facing regarding the Y2K problem. Small businesses are trying to become Y2K complaint, but face many obstacles in doing so. One of the major obstacles is capital. Small businesses are the most vulnerable sector of our business community, as many of them do not have a significant amount of excess cash flow. Yet, a great number of small businesses are already incurring significant costs to become Y2K compliant. Earlier this year, Congress passed Y2K legislation that I authored to provide small businesses with the means to fix their own computer systems. Even small businesses that take advantage of that program, however, will see decreased cash flow from their efforts to correct Y2K problems. 
   The last thing, therefore, this government should do is levy civil money penalties on small businesses that find themselves inadvertently confronted with Y2K problems. Many of these businesses will already have had their operations disrupted and may be in danger of going out of business entirely. The Federal Government should not push them over the edge. 
   This amendment has been carefully crafted so that only those small businesses that are subject to civil money penalties through no fault of their own are granted a waiver. Under this amendment, a small business would only be eligible for a waiver of civil money penalties if it had not violated the applicable rule or regulation in the last 3 years. This provision will help to ensure that businesses that have continuing violations or that have a history of violating Federal rules and regulations will not be let off the hook. 
   Small businesses must also demonstrate to the government agency levying the penalties that the business had previously made a good faith effort to correct its Y2K problems. We must not provide disincentives to businesses so that they do not fix their Y2K problems now. This amendment does not provide such a disincentive. In addition, to receive relief, a small business must show that the violation of the Federal rule or regulation was unavoidable or occurred as a result of efforts to prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that could result in harm to life or property. The amendment also provides that, upon identification of a violation, the small business concern must have initiated reasonable and timely efforts to correct it. Finally, in order to receive the relief provided by this amendment, a small business must have submitted notice, within seven business days, to the appropriate Federal agency. 
   What is clear from these requirements is that the amendment will only apply to conscientious small businesses that have tried in good faith to prepare for the Y2K problem and that promptly correct inadvertent violations of a Federal rule or regulation that nevertheless occur as a result of such problem. It is critically important that these innocent victims not be punished by the Federal Government for a problem that confronts us all.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Department of Defense is currently drafting proposed regulations to establish a procedure on how military bases are to solicit and select bids from financial institutions to provide banking services on domestic military bases. The regulations are likely to be issued in June of this year. I understand that the regulations may establish a presumption in favor of bids received from local banks over the bids received from any other bank. 
   It is important that these new regulations not prevent base commanders from approving a bid from a financial institution that specializes in providing banking services to military personnel, if its bid would provide lower cost and more convenient banking services than a bid submitted by a local bank. There are several financial institutions in this country that have made it their business to provide banking services to our armed forces. Their ability to provide affordable and convenient banking services to our military personnel is evident from the bids they have won to establish branches at bases across the country. The Department of Defense should hold an open and competitive bidding process for the establishment of bank branches on military installations and should not shut out these specialized banks from the process. 
   I do not suggest that the location of a bank not be a consideration in the selection process. However, it should not be the primary criterion. The cost and convenience of banking services for our military personnel should be the overriding factor in determining the bid that is selected, regardless of whether it is a bid from a local bank or a specialized military bank. I intend to follow this regulation closely as it is developed. If it is not written in a manager that best serves the interests of our military personnel, I may seek a legislative change of this policy.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the manager of this bill for giving me the opportunity to rise in strongest opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from Wisconsin. 
   This is becoming an annual ritual where the Senator from Wisconsin seeks to undermine the Navy's No. 1 procurement priority against the will of the administration, the Department of Defense, and at the expense of our Navy warfighters. 
   There are quite a few problems with this amendment and the one that he will offer to follow it. But on this first one, it is absolutely not necessary. A fixed-price contract is already in place. So submitting an amendment that purports to do what is already being done is redundant. 
   Cost caps are normally reserved for problem programs to control cost overruns in the development phase. The F-18 E/F program of today is a model program which has consistently come in under budget. It is a well controlled program with cost incentives in place. 
   The attacks on this program can best be summed up by the words: Don't confuse me with the facts, I have my prejudices, and I have my viewpoints that I am going to argue, regardless of what the facts are. Because the facts are that the F-18 E/F procurement program is under budget and it is ahead of schedule. 
   It absolutely amazes me that the Senator from Wisconsin would seek one more time to hamper the program by adding further administrative cost controls for a program that has already been reviewed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee. All three of these bodies reviewed the F-18 program and found no need to add further administrative constraints to this successful program.

   Mr. BOND. Admiral Nathman says:  
   The OT-IIB Report has done an excellent job of further quantifying and qualifying known issues with the F/A-18E/F. The Navy Developmental and Operational Test process is structured to identify issues prior to production to avoid costly production modifications. 
   The OT-IIB Report has revalidated that process, confirming that no such issues exist. The F/A-18E/F Hornet Program remains a model program, on cost, on schedule, under budget and meeting or exceeding all performance parameters.  
   I think we can take the word of the person who has the responsibility for operational program review. We have people who do this for a living and who look at these programs full-time. This is what they are saying about the program. 
   The F/A-18 multiyear contract will be a fixed price incentive contract. It is a capped program in application. But the agency retains contract administration flexibility, and the contractor maintains inherent cost control incentives. The statutory cap being proposed would undoubtedly increase contract administration costs. 
   In an era where we are experiencing vexing retention problems, I see no need to add additional burdens to a major acquisition program intended to give our warfighters the best equipment available. 
   The viability of the Navy's tactical aviation program is directly tied to the success of this program, and any effort to tie up this program with needless administrative controls is counterproductive. The amendment also contains no cost exemptions that would exclude costs beyond the control of the contractor, such as allowance for new technology built into later models or changes in aircraft quantity. 
   To date, the F-18E/F has flown 4,665 hours during more than 3,100 flights with no mishaps. The aircraft just finished the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development phase and is scheduled to enter the Operational Test and Evaluation Phase, or OPEVAL, this week. It is anticipated that OPEVAL will be complete, looking to have a decision on full rate production by March 2000.

   Mr. BOND. Let me reiterate that the F/A-18 program is under budget and ahead of schedule. Why don't we just ask the men and women who have flown them? Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, came before us. He represents, and is responsible for, the men and women who fly these aircraft. He has flown one, and has given overwhelming, enthusiastic, and unqualified support for the Super Hornet. 
   Now, we have hearings in this body for a reason; that is, to listen to the people who have the expertise and the experience. These people have told us that the E/F is the best thing we have for the Navy, and they want them. They know it is ahead of schedule, and under budget, with improved performance. Why do we even bother with hearings if we do not pay attention? 
   I say, with respect to the second amendment, this is an attempt to set up the GAO as a decision making authority in the Defense Department. Constitutionally they are not authorized to do so. We have a director of OPEVAL, who is appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate, to make these decisions. I believe in legislative oversight. I believe in the GAO having a responsibility to raise questions. The people who have the responsibility in the executive branch have answered these questions. 
   I think it is time to quit hampering the program, trying to kill or cripple a program that is providing us the best tactical aircraft for the Navy's carriers. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in what I trust will be a tabling motion to table both of the amendments or to vote against them if they are not tabled. 
   I thank the Chair and the chairman of the subcommittee for giving me this opportunity.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to be joined by Senator KERRY, the Ranking Member on the Small Business Committee, which I chair. Our bill is simple and straightforward. It clarifies and amends certain provisions of law enacted as part of my ``Red Tape Reduction Act,'' the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. In 1996, this body led the way toward enactment of this important law. With a unanimous vote, we took a major step to ensure that small businesses are treated fairly by federal agencies. 
   Like the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which it amended, the Red Tape Reduction Act is a remedial statute, designed to redress the fact that uniform federal regulations impose disproportionate impacts on small entities, including small business, small not-for-profits and small governments. A recent study conducted for the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration documented, yet again, that small businesses continue to face higher regulatory compliance costs than their big-business counterparts. With the vast majority of businesses in this nation being small enterprises, it only makes sense for the rulemaking process to ensure that the concerns of such small entities get a fair airing early in the development of a federal regulation. 
   The bill Senator KERRY and I are introducing focuses on Section 244 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which amended chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act). As a result, each ``covered agency'' is required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel (Panel) to receive advice and comments from small entities. Specifically, under section 609(b), each covered agency is to convene a Panel of federal employees, representing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget, the Chief Counsel of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and the covered agency promulgating the regulation, to receive input from small entities prior to publishing an initial Regulatory Flexibility analysis for a proposed rule with a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Panel, which convenes for 60 days, produces a report containing comments from the small entities and the Panel's own recommendations. The report is provided to the head of the agency, who reviews the report and, where appropriate, modifies the proposed rule, initial regulatory analysis or the decision on whether the rule significantly impacts small entities. The Panel report becomes a part of the rulemaking record. 
   Consistent with the overall purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the objective of the Panel process is to minimize the adverse impacts and increase the benefits to small entities affected by the 
   agency's actions. Consequently, the true proof of each Panel's effectiveness in reducing the regulatory burden on small entities is not known until the agency issues the proposed and final rules. So far, the results are encouraging. 
   Under current law, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are the only agencies currently covered by the Panel process. Our bill adds the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a covered agency. In 1996, the Red Tape Reduction Act expressly included the IRS under the Regulatory Flexibility Act; however, the Treasury Department has interpreted the language in the law in a manner that essentially writes them out of the law. The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 clarifies which interpretative rules involving the internal revenue code are to be subject to compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, for those rules with a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the IRS would be required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel. 
   If the Treasury Department and the IRS had implemented the Red Tape Reduction Act as Congress originally intended, the regulatory burdens on small businesses could have been reduced, and small businesses could have been saved considerable trouble in fighting unwarranted rulemaking actions. For instance, with input from the small business community early in the process, the IRS' 1997 temporary regulations on the uniform capitalization rules could have had taken into consideration the adverse effects that inventory accounting would have on farming businesses, and especially nursery growers. Similarly, if the IRS had conducted an initial Regulatory Flexibility, it would have learned of the enormous problems surrounding its limited partner regulations prior to issuing the proposal in January 1997. These regulations, which became known as the ``stealth tax regulations,'' would have raised self-employment taxes on countless small businesses operated as limited partnerships or limited liability companies, and also would have imposed burdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information requirements. 
   Specifically, the bill strikes the language in section 603 of title 5 that included IRS interpretative rules under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, ``but only to the extent that such interpretative rules impose on small entities a collection of information requirement.'' The Treasury Department has misconstrued this language in two ways. First, unless the IRS imposes a requirement on small businesses to complete a new OMB-approved form, the Treasury says Reg Flex does not apply. Second, in the limited circumstances where the IRS has acknowledged imposing a new reporting requirement, the Treasury has limited its analysis of the impact on small businesses to the burden imposed by the form. As a result, the Treasury Department and the IRS have turned Reg Flex compliance into an unnecessary, second Paperwork Reduction Act.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I am introducing the ``National Conference on Small Business Act.'' This bill is designed to create a permanent independent commission that will carry-on the extraordinary work that has been accomplished by three White House Conferences on Small Business. 
   For the past 15 years, small businesses have been the fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy. When large businesses were restructuring and laying off significant numbers of workers, small businesses not only filled the gap, but their growth actually caused a net increase in new jobs. Today, small businesses employ 55% of all workers in the United States and they generate 50% of the gross domestic product. Were it not for small businesses, our country could not have experienced the sustained economic upsurge that has been ongoing since 1992. 
   Because small businesses play such a significant role in our economy, in both rural towns and bustling inner cities, I believe it is important that the Federal government sponsor a national conference every four years to highlight the successes of small businesses and to focus national attention on the problems that may be hindering the ability of small businesses to start up and grow. 
   Small business ownership is, has been, and will continue to be the dream of millions of Americans. Countries from all over the world send delegations to the United States to study why our system of small business ownership is so successful, all the while looking for a way to duplicate our success in their countries. Because we see and experience the successes of small businesses on a daily basis, it is easy to lose sight of the very special thing we have going for us in the United States--where each of us can have the opportunity to own and run our own business. 
   The ``National Conference on Small Business Act'' is designed to capture and focus our attention on small business every four years. In this way, we  will take the opportunity to study what is happening throughout the United States to small businesses. In one sense, the bill is designed to put small business on a pinnacle so we can appreciate what they have accomplished. At the same time, and just as important, every four years we will have an opportunity to learn from small businesses in each state what is not going well for them--such as, actions by the Federal government that hinder small business growth or state and local regulations that are a deterrent to starting a business. 
   My bill creates an independent, bipartisan National Commission on Small Business, which will be made up of 8 small business advocates and the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy. Every four years, during the first year following a presidential election, the President will name two National Commissioners. In the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of each body will name two National Commissioners and the Minority Leaders will each name one. 
   Widespread participation from small businesses in each state will contribute to the work leading up to the National Conference. Under the 
   bill, the National Conference will take place one year after the National Commissioners are appointed. The first act of the Commissioners will be to request that each Governor and each U.S. Senator name a small business delegate and alternate delegate from their respective states to the National Convention. Each U.S. Representative will name a small business delegate and alternative from his or her Congressional district. And the President will name a delegate and alternate from each state. 
   The small business delegates will play a major role leading up to the National Conference on Small Business. There will be at least one meeting of the delegates at their respective State Conferences. We will be looking to the small business delegates to develop and highlight issues of critical concern to small businesses. The work at the state level by the small business delegates will need to be thorough and thoughtful to make the National Conference a success. 
   My goal will be for the small business delegates to think broadly, that is, to think ``out of the box.'' Their attention should include but not be restricted to the traditional issues associated with small business concerns, such as access to capital, tax reform and regulatory reform. In my role as Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I will urge the delegates to focus on a wide array of issues that impact significantly on small businesses, including the importance of a solid education and the need for skilled, trained workers. 
   Once the small business delegates are selected, the National Commission on Small Business will serve as a resource to the delegates for issue development and for planning the State Conferences. The National Commission will have a modest staff, including an Executive Director, that will work full time to make the State and National Conferences successes. A major resource to the National Commission and its staff will be the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from SBA. The Chief Counsel and the Office of Advocacy will serve as a major resource to the National Commission, and in turn, to the small business delegates, by providing them with both substantive background information and other administrative materials in support of the State and National Conferences. 
   Mr. President, small businesses generally do not have the resources to maintain full time representatives to lobby our Federal government. They are too busy running their businesses to devote much attention to educating government officials as to what is going well, what is going poorly, and what needs improvement for the small business community. The National Conference on Small Business will give small businesses an opportunity every four years to make its mark on the Congress and the Executive Branch. I urge each of my colleagues to review this proposal, and I hope they will agree to join me as cosponsors of the ``National Conference on Small Business Act.''

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about gun shows, pawn shops, and ammo clips these past few days. We have been told that if we just tweak the law a little here, or add another provision making something else illegal that somehow people who gun down others in cold blood won't do it anymore. 
   It's as if wishing would make it so. 
   Thirty years ago we had very few gun laws, and surprisingly, no high school shooting sprees to document every few days, every few weeks, or every few months. 
   But thirty years ago we also had stricter discipline in schools, no school officials worried about lawsuits if they expelled a violent child, and parents who also exerted more control.  
   Now we have a new gun law a year. We have school officials who fear lawsuits, and federal law which seems designed to keep violent kids in classrooms, rather than removed--although I hope the Frist-Ashcroft amendment will make some improvements. And we have an industry--in the name of entertainment--that produces violence and violent pornography at such a pace that no one has any idea of the breadth and width of exposure our kids now have to it. 
   Movies, television, videos, music, computer games. Killing, maiming, and destruction--all in the name of entertainment. 
   Why is anyone surprised in this new topsey-turvy world, that some students plan mass murders rather than planning their graduation party. 
   Today I thought it time to inject a little dose of reality into these proceedings, and get us started down a road which I believe needs to be explored. My amendment empanels an independent commission to study the motion picture industry--from top to bottom--to see if the federal government is subsidizing, facilitating or otherwise encouraging the production of violent, or pornographic materials. And if so, to make recommendations to Congress and the President to promote accountability in the motion picture industry in order to reduce juvenile access to violent, pornographic, or other harmful material in motion pictures. Simply put, we want to discourage, not encourage access to these materials. 
   At the outset, let's make it clear that a great deal of what kids see on the big screen is not harmful and it is done by talented people who are just as concerned about our young people as anyone else. However, there are hundreds, if not thousands of releases each year that have profound effects on teens who see them. 
   Let us be very clear about one other thing before we continue, because we have head a lot about the gun industry and their so-called political power. 
   Mr. President, they don't hold a candle to the movie industry. Hollywood has the money, the glamour, the lifestyle of the rich and famous. They have Beverly Hills, they generate publicity for a living, and they have access to the Lincoln Bedroom. In fact, the NRA actually brought in a famous actor in order to have some hope of getting a fair hearing for its position. 
   But the most disturbing, and least discussed these past few days, is exactly who it is in this country that has glamourized guns and violence. It is certainly not everyone's favorite bogeyman the NRA. It is not the biathletes who compete in the Olympics. Quite simply, it is the entertainment industry. Guns, gore, and violence, targeted not at soccer moms--but to their sons. 
   And worse yet, it is not just gun use, but gun misuse which is glorified. Gun-toting murders as heros, out to right some perceived wrong. Who even knew what an Uzi or Tech 9 was until they saw it in some show?

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it outlines ``copycat'' acts of violence who fashion their criminal actions--murder and rape--off brilliant ``how to'' works of theater such as ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``Basketball Diaries.'' 
   We know that merchants of violence profit handsomely from some products which hurt our children and cost our society. Who for a second believes that the 40,000 murders that our children witness on the TV screen during their childhoods does not have some terrible numbing effect. We can't stop Hollywood from producing the insanity, but we can attempt to discourage it and to help them share in the burden that their ``profiteering at any cost'' imposes on society. 
   Now I don't believe we need any more studies outlining the numbing effects that movie and television violence have on our children. What we need to know is--are the American taxpayers subsidizing this numbing down of American youth? And if so, what can and should we do about it? 
   That is why our Commission looks to people who are independent of the power and influence of the motion picture industry. 
   Clearly, advertising is directed at attracting all audiences including our young. These wealthy and talented industry people have a right to produce this material but we should not extend them every courtesy when it comes to polluting the minds of our young. There is always parental responsibility, but that does not excuse others from acting responsibly as well. 
   Does it, or does it not, take a village to raise a child? Last I looked, Hollywood is part of our village. So where is the responsibility of those who produce the harmful material? 
   Though the power of the motion picture industry is great, we should take a turn listening to parents instead of actors and show leadership instead of cowardice. Some may object on behalf of the wealthy merchants of carnage and smut saying they have a constitutional right to pollute the minds of our children and have no responsibility as an artist or producer to use their power to try and help our nation's parents. But I think they are wrong. Short-sighted and wrong. 
   Thus if we adopt the Bond-Domenici amendment, we will be saying it is time that parents, and grandparents--not just Hollywood moguls--will have an opportunity to participate in the debate on how best to protect our children. And if this notion offends the Hollywood crowd and their ubiquitous presence in Washington--so be it. We should make quite certain that the public is not contributing or facilitating the production of this sort of material and not facilitating its marketing to our young people. Of, that if we 
   are, people understand it and decide it is good use of national resources. 
   Now there are other thoughtful amendments to this underlying bill which call on Clinton Administration agencies to study advertising or anti-trust provisions. My amendment is designed to get the best minds outside of the Clinton Administration and Hollywood--and if you have any serious questions why, I think this past weekend's multi-million fund-raising trip to Beverly Hills answers those immediately. 
   It is with a great sense of frustration that I come to you and that is because I am tired of telling parents that there is nothing we can do to help shield their kids beyond relying on the good will and tender mercies of the same ones making blood money off the trash. 
   If the government can't do anything about it at this time, I think it is worth letting someone on the outside see if it is possible to bring some discipline and responsibility to those who are producing and marketing the insanity. As you all know, not everyone in the film industry is proud of what their colleagues produce for the public. I have no intention of painting with a broad brush, but the ones without discipline--the ones that don't care about our children, should not be shielded from scrutiny just because they may be some of the best people to invite to parties, vacations and fund-raisers. 
   The Commission is proposed to be made up of 12 members appointed by the President, the Majority Leader and the Speaker and review the following:

   Mr. BOND. One always is impressed with the ability of Hollywood and their obfuscation. We have heard some responses from the Hollywood community. They said this is a massive tax bill. That is not what the purpose was. We amended the amendment so it does not even refer directly to taxes. 
   The Senator from Vermont mentioned and gave a wonderful rendition of ``Gone With The Wind'' and ``Star Wars.'' We are not worried about ``Star Wars.'' We are not worried about ``Gone With The Wind.'' We are worried about parents who cannot stop all of the mayhem and violence and murder that is being marketed to their kids, to their kids' friends, to their kids' neighbors every time they turn around. 
   We think it is time that somebody looked at how we hold Hollywood accountable. I am asking not that we investigate. I believe there is enough evidence of these teenage killers, citing the fact that they have been inspired by movies, to know that something has to be done. 
   My good friend from California said, we are regulating content. I believe she was one of the leaders who argued for regulating the content of tobacco advertising and said we are going to eliminate tobacco advertising. That is content. That is regulation. That is regulation of speech. 
   Incidentally, you can regulate what is going to children. We do regulate speech. We do not allow pornography to go to kids. We do not allow tobacco advertising to go to them. I will tell you something, when I see ``Basketball Diaries,'' with Leonardo DiCaprio as a teenage hero walking into a classroom in a black trenchcoat, with a gun, and murdering his fellow students, I see there is a message that Hollywood has sent to our kids. If I could regulate it, if I could stop it, I would like to stop it. 
   I want to get a national debate going and ask and see how we can stop this filth being targeted at our kids. Does anyone think ``Basketball Diaries'' is designed to attract older movie viewers like me? I do not think so. That is targeted directly to kids. How do we deal with that? That is what the Domenici-Bond amendment asks. All of the obfuscation and all of the misleading arguments put up by the good folks in Hollywood are not going to take attention away from the fact that they are responsible. 
   Just in the last couple days the President of CBS said he was going to withdraw a violent drama called ``Falcone.'' I quote Leslie Moonves.  
   While it's not fair to blame the media for the rampage, Moonves said that ``anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with this is an idiot.''  
   I suggest that tells the tale. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Fulton, Missouri's ``I Love America Day.'' Several years ago, the faculty of McIntire Elementary school became concerned that many of the students did not have a true sense of patriotism and national pride. What started out at one elementary school has spread to a communitywide celebration. Each year they highlight all levels of government and place special emphasis on pride in the flag. This year's celebration will include a presentation of the colors by the VFW flag team, a twenty-one gun salute, taps to honor those lost in service, presentations by the VFW, Mayor Craghead, and others, and a special demonstration by the Army's Golden Knights parachute team. As you can see, Mr. President, this event has grown into a wonderful day of activities that will enrich the sense of patriotism not only in our youth, but also in the entire community. I commend the organizers of ``I Love America Day'' for the wonderful example they set for Missouri and the entire country.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Y2K Act from my perspective as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business. The choice presented by this legislation is clear--if you are a supporter of small business in America, you must support this legislation and vote for cloture so that the Senate may proceed on this bill. 
   One of the highest priorities of the small business community for this Congress is that we establish procedures to resolve disputes efficiently arising from the Y2K computer problem. The consequences that may arise from this problem are as yet unknown. However, small family-owned businesses are understandably concerned that their companies may be in danger either from the problem itself or from suits brought by trial lawyers concerned only with the fees they can obtain from settlements. 
   The small businesses concerned with Y2K litigation are located on Main Streets all across America, not just Silicon Valley. They are this country's mom and pop groceries, its dry cleaners and its hardware stores. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the nation's largest small business association, strongly supports this legislation. The NFIB surveyed its members and found that an overwhelming 93% support capping damage awards for Y2K suits. The small business community is speaking with a unified voice in support of Y2K liability legislation and we should not ignore that voice. 
   I have heard during the debate that enactment of this bill will harm small businesses. That simply is not the case. By merely reading the bill, it is apparent that small businesses will benefit greatly from its provision. So that we may dispel the myths surrounding this bill once and for all, it is important to point out several of the provisions of this legislation that small women and family-owned businesses will find particularly helpful. 
   First, the legislation encourages alternative dispute resolution for Y2K lawsuits. This will help small businesses tremendously. According to the Gartner Group, an international consulting firm, more than $1 trillion will be spent on litigation relating to the Y2K problem. Lawsuits are likely to occur up and down the supply chain. That is, if the supplier of a family-owned business has a Y2K failure that impacts its abilities to serve its customers, it may have a lawsuit on its hands. That business, to recoup its losses, may then be forced to turn around and sue its supplier, which very well may also be a small business. The supplier then will sue someone else to recoup its losses. The litigation cycle is never-ending and small businesses have the most to lose. 
   A good example of a small business that may be caught in this cycle of litigation is a constituent of mine who owns a small medical supply company that provides oxygen to patients. He has already determined he has a Y2K problem with his computers and is diligently trying to correct the problem. The Health Care Financing Administration has even required him to create a booklet to provide to customers regarding the steps he has taken to become Y2K compliant. If his suppliers or vendors have a Y2K failure and he cannot supply needed oxygen to his customers, he may very well be subject to lawsuits that could cost him his company. This is the type of situation we must prevent from occurring. 
   Women-owned and family-owned businesses are the most vulnerable from costly litigation, either as plaintiffs or defendants, because they don't have the time to devote to it and don't have excess revenue to afford it. In addition, small businesses do not want to sue companies with which they have long-standing relationships and whose survival is tied to their own. Therefore, encouraging resolution of disputes outside of the courtroom is of great assistance to these businesses. 
   Second, the legislation requires plaintiffs to provide defendants with notice prior to filing a complaint and allows defendants 60 days to correct Y2K problems suffered by the plaintiff. Encouraging mitigation and prompt settlement of claims allows small women-owned and family-owned businesses to recover quickly from business disruptions and, most importantly, allows small businesses to continue doing business. As I stated before, many of these businesses do not have the cash flow to engage in long, drawn-out disputes, if they want to stay in business. This provision will allow small women-owned and family-owned businesses to focus on correcting their problems and continuing in business. This is what small businesses want to do and what Congress should encourage. 
   The bill also establishes punitive damage limits for suits against small businesses. The bill provides that under most circumstances a small business defendant cannot be subject to punitive damages greater than 3 times the compensatory damages awarded or $250,000, whichever is less. I don't believe that anybody can reasonably suggest that this provision will not help the small women-owned and family-owned businesses. Other than the obvious affect the cap will have, placing a limit on punitive damages will allow plaintiffs in meritorious suits to recover their actual damages quicker. Moreover, the cap will decrease the number of frivolous lawsuits that small businesses may have to face, as unscrupulous attorneys will realize that large settlements will not be forthcoming.  
   It is also important to point out what this bill will not do. It will not prevent a small business from availing itself of the judicial system when it has been wronged by another party's actions related to the Y2K problem. The bill does not affect the enforcement of written contracts nor does it prevent a small business from bringing a lawsuit alleging negligence or other grounds based in tort law. The bill merely establishes a procedure to efficiently remedy disputes and preclude a feeding-frenzy on the part of unscrupulous plaintiff's attorneys attempting to earn their fortune from the Y2K problem. 
   Earlier this year, Congress passed Y2K legislation that I authored to provide small businesses with the means to fix their own computer systems. The next step is to discourage frivolous suits and permit small women-owned and family-owned businesses to resolve Y2K disputes without costly litigation. The bill now before the Senate is a bi-partisan compromise that will accomplish this objective without adversely affecting lawsuits that have merit. 
   I believe that the choice is clear. If you are a supporter of small women-owned and family-owned business and you want to see them continue as the economic engine that runs this country, you must support this legislation and vote in favor of cloture so that the Senate may proceed on this bill.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Early Childhood Development Act of 1999'' with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY. 
   Through this legislation, we are seeking to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood education and quality child care programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need. 
   Recent research shows that the first few years of life are an absolutely crucial developmental period for each child with a significant bearing on future prospects. During this time, infant brain development occurs more rapidly than previously thought, and the sensations and experiences of this time go a long way toward shaping that baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting effects on all aspects of the child's life. 
   And parents and family are really the key to this development. Early, positive interaction with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other adults plays a critical role. 
   Here's what's going on during these amazing early years that in so many ways are crucial to each child. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Most things happening in the surrounding world--such as a mother's caress, a father's voice, even playing with a brother or sister--helps this wiring pattern expand and connect. A baby with a stimulating environment will make these connections at a tremendous rate. However, infants and children who play very little or are rarely touched or stimulated develop brains that can be 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. 
   Really we shouldn't be surprised that parents have known instinctively for generations some of these basic truths that science is just now figuring out. Most parents just know that babies need to be hugged, caressed, and spoken to. 
   Of course, the types of interaction that can most enhance a child's development change as the baby's body and mind grow. The types of behavior that are so instinctual for the youngest babies may not be quite so obvious for  two- and three-year-olds. Raising a child is perhaps the most important thing any of us will do, but it is also one of the most complicated. 
   And parents today also face a variety of stresses and problems that were unheard of a generation ago. In many families, both parents work. Whether by choice or by necessity, many parents may not be able to read mountains of books and articles about parenting and child development to keep perfectly up-to-date on what types of experiences are most appropriate for their child at his or her particular stage of development. They also must try to find good child care and good environments where their children can be stimulated and educated while they work. Simply put, most parents can probably use a little help. 
   Many communities across the country have developed successful early childhood development programs to meet these needs. Most of the programs work with parents to help them understand their child's development and to discuss ways to help further develop the little baby's potential. Others simply provide basic child care and an exciting learning environment for children of parents who both have to work. 
   In a report released in 1998, the prestigious RAND Corporation reviewed early childhood programs like these and found that they provide higher-risk children with both short- and long-run benefits. These benefits include enhanced development of both the mind and the child's ability to interact with others, they include improvement in educational outcomes, and they include a long-term increase in self-sufficiency through finding jobs and staying off government programs. 
   Of course, it's no mystery to many people from Missouri that this type of program can be successful. In Missouri, we are both proud and lucky to be the home of Parents as Teachers. This tremendous initiative is an early childhood parent education program that has been designed to empower all parents to giver their young child the best possible start in life. Expanding Parents as Teachers to a statewide program was perhaps my proudest accomplishment when I was Missouri's Governor. 
   With additional resources, these programs could be expanded and enhanced to improve the opportunities for many more infants and young children. And we have found that all children can benefit from these programs. Economically successful, two-income families can benefit from early childhood programs just as much as a single-parent family with a mother seeking work opportunities. 
   The legislation that Senator KERRY and I are introducing will support families by building on local initiatives like Parents as Teachers that have already been proven successful in working with families as they raise their infants and toddlers. The bill will help improve and expand these successful programs, of which there are numerous other examples, such as programs sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as state initiatives such as ``Success by Six'' in Massachusetts and Vermont and the ``Early Childhood Initiative'' in Pennsylvania. 
   The bill will provide federal funds to states to begin or expand local initiatives to provide early childhood education, parent education, and family support. The bill will also expand quality child care programs for families, especially infant care. Best of all, we propose to do this with no federal mandates, and few federal guidelines. 
   Many of our society's problems, such as the high school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, and juvenile crime can be traced in part to inadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. Increasingly, research is showing us that a child's social and intellectual development as well as there likelihood to become involved in these types of difficulties is deeply rooted in the early interaction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years. 
   Ultimately, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is the primary responsibility of his or her parents and family. Government cannot and should not become a substitute for parents and families, but we can help them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet the everyday challenges of parenting.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business to introduce the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence Act of SENSE Act. This bill calls on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to do the sensible thing--wait for sound science before imposing new ergonomics regulations on small businesses. If enacted, the SENSE Act would require OSHA to wait for the results of a study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) before issuing proposed or final regulations, standards or guidelines on ergonomics. As a native of Missouri, the ``Show Me State,'' waiting for the NAS study makes good sense to me. 
   In introducing the SENSE Act, I am pleased to be joined by numerous colleagues from all across the country--including Senators ENZI, JEFFORDS, BURNS, VOINOVICH, SNOWE, ASHCROFT, MCCONNELL, LOTT, NICKLES, HUTCHINSON, MACK, COVERDELL, COLLINS, SHELBY, KYL, FITZGERALD, ABRAHAM, GREGG, HUTCHISON, HELMS, BUNNING, CRAPO, BENNETT, DEWINE, HAGEL, SESSIONS, and CHAFEE. These Senators, like me, agree with their small business constituents that it makes good sense for OSHA to wait for the results of the NAS study before proposing additional regulatory requirements for small businesses. 
   Just last year, Congress and the President agreed to spend $890,000 for NAS to undertake a thorough, objective, and de novo review of the scientific literature to examine the cause-and-effect relationship between repetitive tasks in the workplace and musculoskeletal disorders. The study is intended to achieve a scientific understanding of the conditions and causes of musculoskeletal disorders. The NAS has selected a panel of experts to conduct the study. The panel will examine the scientific data on the multiple factors and influences that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders and answer seven questions provided by Representatives BONILLA and Livingston. The NAS will complete its study by January 2001. As intended by Congress and the President, the NAS study will assist OSHA and the Congress in determining whether sound science supports a comprehensive ergonomics regulation as envisioned by OSHA. 
   In theory, an ergonomics regulation would attempt to reduce musculoskeletal disorders, such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, muscle aches and back pain, which, in some instances, have been attributed to on-the-job activities. However, the medical community is divided sharply on whether scientific  evidence has established a true cause-and-effect relationship between such problems and workplace duties. We need to understand the relationship between work and these injuries before moving forward. 
   Regrettably, rather than waiting for NAS' findings, OSHA now plans to publish a proposed rule by September of 1999. In fact, OSHA officials have suggested that a final rule could be issued by the end of 2000--just a few months before NAS will complete its study. This simply doesn't make sense. The NAS study should identify scientific and medical studies that are based on sound science and provide solid scientific evidence regarding the causation of ergonomics injuries. Our intent is simply to ensure that the requirements of any ergonomics program proposed by OSHA are based on sound science and are effective to improve workplace safety and health. It only makes sense for OSHA to wait for the scientific and medical information needed to know whether it is headed down the right path. 
   Waiting for the NAS study won't stop the progress being made as ergonomic principles are applied to the workplace. And, progress is being made. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of injuries and illnesses involving repeated trauma, strains, sprains, tears, and carpal tunnel syndrome are all on the decline. Employers are actively implementing measures to address ergonomic risk factors. The SENSE Act is in no way intended to discourage employers from continuing to implement voluntary measures where appropriate and effective. Similarly, the SENSE Act does not prevent OSHA from continuing to work on ergonomics. In fact, I would encourage OSHA to use the time prior to the completion of the NAS study to research ergonomics further, identify successful prevention strategies, and provide technical assistance. For those who would argue that waiting for the NAS study will result in more employees being injury, OSHA can exercise its enforcement authority under the General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, to ensure a safe workplace and address any significant ergonomic hazards. My bill doesn't change that authority provided under current law. 
   Simply put, the SENSE Act requires OSHA to wait for NAS to complete its study and submit the findings in a report to Congress. Congress would then have 30 days to review the final report before OSHA issues proposed or final regulations, standards or guidelines. From where I stand, it only makes sense for Congress and OSHA to have the benefit of the NAS study before OSHA proposes to require employers to implement a comprehensive program addressing musculoskeletal disorders. 
   Tomorrow in the other body, the compansion bill to the SENSE Act is scheduled for mark up. H.R. 987, known as the ``Workplace Preservation Act,'' was introduced by Representantive ROY BLUNT from Missouri on March 4. Representative BLUNT is doing an excellent job shepherding his bill through the other body. In fact, his efforts have produced a bipartisan list of 138 cosponsors. I expect the Senate to show similar support for our Nation's small businesses. 
   I urge my collagues in the Senate to take a good look at the SENSE Act and join us in supporting legislation to ensure that the federal government does not propose an ergonomics regulation for small businesses until Congress can assess the findings of the NAS study. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence (SENSE) Act be printed at this point in the RECORD.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on March 2, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued its decision in the Environmental Defense Fund versus Environmental Protection Agency lawsuit whereby the EDF filed suit challenging several provisions of the EPA's air quality conformity rule. The court ruled in favor of the EDF. 
   This decision overturned a well-established EPA rule permitting previously approved transportation projects being ``grandfathered'' into transportation air quality conformity plans. The court decision eliminates any flexibility for local authorities to proceed with projects and protect them from disruptions caused by issues often beyond their control--including changes in federal regulations and standards. In addition, the court decision impacted use of submitted budgets, non-federal project flexibility, grace periods before SIP disapprovals, and SIP safety margins. 
   As of April 19, the Federal Highway Administration had identified ten areas in conformity lapse where transportation projects are impacted. The areas are: Ashland, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Monterey, California; Santa Barbara, California; Knoxville, Tennessee; Paducah, Kentucky; and South Bend, Indiana. 
   Many people probably thought that would be the end of the list. To give another example of why this is such an important issue--one week ago today the United States Department of Transportation determined that the Kansas City metropolitan area's conformity plan had lapsed. The Kansas and Missouri Divisions of the Federal Highway Administration halted approval of transportation projects in the region. More and more areas could be faced with this situation. 
   If we do not address this issue, it could potentially bring to a halt transportation improvement projects around the country--further jeopardizing the safety of the traveling public, hindering economic growth, and in my opinion, doing nothing to improve the air quality situation in any of these areas. 
   Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. 
   Mr. President, the only thing this legislation does is amend the Clean Air Act to reinstate those EPA rules which were struck down or remanded in the Environmental Defense Fund vs. Environmental Protection Agency lawsuit. No more. No less. This legislation has zero impact on the Clean Air Act of EPA's rules. 
   In 1997, in the EPA's information on the final conformity rule that incorporated the 1997 changes, EPA reported the following:  
   The conformity rule changes promulgated today result from the experience that EPA, the Department of Transportation, and state and local air and transportation officials have had with implementation of the rule since it was first published in November of 1993. While these changes clarify the rule and in some cases offer increased flexibility, they will not result in any negative change in health and environmental benefits.  
   So the EPA got together with the stakeholders, issued a rulemaking, provided the public comment period, issued a final rule, practiced for several years, and defended the position in court. I want to take this position and codify it. 
   Mr. President--there will be some who will argue for more or less restrictive changes to the underlying conformity provision in the Clean Air Act. Should that discussion and debate occur? Yes. I might support some of those changes. However, we have an immediate situation where transportation projects around the country are or could be impacted by the court's ruling. States and metropolitan areas across the country are needing assistance with this issue. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this common sense legislation that simply takes EPA's own regulations on conformity that the court overturned and puts them into law. 
   Mr. President, we must address the immediate situation and then continue the debate on conformity to address further needs.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Families for  Home Education (FHE) in observance of Home Education Week, May 2-8, in my home State of Missouri. I join with the Missouri General Assembly in recognizing their commitment not only to excellence in education, but also to the promotion of public policy that strengthens the family. 
   Home educators make tremendous sacrifices to educate our nation's young people and they are making a difference. Countless studies show that parental involvement positively impacts the education of a child. Home-schooled children, in particular, benefit greatly from the individualized, one-on-one training they receive from dedicated parents and home educators. They are also afforded unique opportunities to participate in apprenticeships, and community and civic organizations. These activities serve to strengthen social skills and enrich their overall educational experience. 
   In today's challenging society, it is more important than ever that our young people receive a quality education if they are to succeed in the expanding global market. Home educators play a vital part in preparing children, tomorrow's workforce, to successfully compete and prosper in the adult world. I commend these dedicated parents and FHE, and wish them continued success in their endeavors.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, during the past recess, the third anniversary of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, better known as the Red Tape Reduction Act, passed on March 29 with little notice or fanfare. 
   Let me suggest that while the Red Tape Reduction Act is hardly a household word, it is well worth commemorating, and it is extremely important to the small businesses in America who are oppressed by excessive Government regulation and unthinking regulation imposing unnecessary burdens on them. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD letters of support that speak to the importance of this law to our Nation's small businesses.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the need for oversight to find out what Government agencies are doing with the laws we pass. Today, I am here to report on the oversight of the Small Business Committee, because we want to make sure that the small businesses get the fair treatment they are entitled to under the law. 
   Unfortunately, while we have made some progress and offered hope to many small businesses, we have found a number of agencies have failed to make the grade. So in a few moments, I am going to announce a new series of awards for small-business-oppressing Government agencies who deserve to have some help in unclogging the regulatory pipelines in their office. 
   For several decades, small business owners have watched with dismay as Federal regulations have proliferated. These regulations are taking increasingly large amounts of time and money to interpret, and compliance costs have soared. Until recently, we were shocked by the general assumption that small business owners spend 5 percent of their revenues to prepare their taxes. 
   Last Monday, in a hearing we had in the Small Business Committee, we found it worse than we imagined. The committee heard testimony from Brian Gloe, the co-CEO of Rosse Lithographing Company in Kansas City, that his business, for example, pays more than 16 percent of its net income just to figure out how much it owes the IRS. That is even before they write the check to pay the taxes. 
   As my colleagues well know, the IRS is just one Federal agency. Other agencies imposing huge burdens on small businesses include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Add to that list the countless other agencies a small business must deal with, depending on what products it sells or services it provides. Each of these agencies has thousands of requirements which must be followed under penalty of fines or even prison time. 
   In short, the Red Tape Reduction Act was long overdue. I was very pleased that this body passed the measure unanimously. It passed the House on a consent calendar. It was signed into law on March 29, 1996. It was designed to provide tools to small business owners to assure regulatory fairness and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. 
   The new law contains important innovative provisions. One, it gives small entities the ability to take an agency to court for failing to consider ways to reduce the economic impact of their new regulations. 
   Two, it requires agencies to prepare ``plain English'' compliance guides so that small business owners will not have to hire a team of lawyers just to interpret the regulations. 
   Three, it makes it easier for small businesses to recover attorney's fees when agencies make demands for outrageous fines and penalties that are not sustainable in court. 
   And finally, it allows Congress to review and disapprove certain new agency regulations that are extreme or are not what Congress intended. 
   Despite the straightforward nature of this law, it seems some agencies are ignoring Congress' commonsense mandate to make things simpler for the little guy and other agencies are actively fighting against it. On March 10, Senator KERRY, the ranking Democrat on the Small Business Committee, joined me in hosting a roundtable with representatives of small business on of the Red Tape Reduction Act. We learned that many agencies have failed to fulfill their obligations under the new law and under the Regulatory Flexibility Act which preceded it. 
   These important laws apply to all regulations, unless the head of any  agency can demonstrate that a new rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. That makes sense to me. When new regulations will affect small businesses, the agency should comply with the law so the burdens on 
   small businesses will be identified and reduced. 
   You would think that agencies would embrace gladly the opportunity to help, rather than impose unnecessary burdens on the smallest of businesses. Regrettably, that just is not the case. A closer look shows that these agencies are using every trick in the book, exploiting every known loophole, and creating new ones not to comply with the law. Rather than help, they work to exempt the regulations from the law. 
   Here are a couple of examples: No. 1, false and ridiculous claims. EPA is infamous for its legalistic dodge, asserting that the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter would not affect small entities. This flies in the face of our experience, when they jack the standards up so hard it requires punitive measures that harshly burden small businesses. I have heard from many government officials in towns throughout Missouri who are concerned that their constituents will lose jobs as a result of those standards. 
   Two, raising the bar. Agencies avoid compliance with the law by erroneously asserting a rule would not have a significant impact on small businesses. But data from the affected small businesses clearly show otherwise. They are being affected in large numbers. 
   Three, the artful dodge. Agencies like the EPA and OSHA avoid the law by issuing guidance and permits rather than rules subject to notice and comment. I guess they have not heard the old saying: If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it must be a duck--even if they want to call it a permit or guidance. 
   Fourth, the plain old loophole. The Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, in particular has abused a narrow ``good cause'' exception to avoid following these laws. 
   These are just a few examples of ways to get around the law. Instead of implementing simple, needed reforms, the agencies thumb their noses at Congress and the millions of small business owners. Their sleight of hand has not gone unnoticed. I am not going to stand idly by. Too often in Washington, when we pass a law in Congress, we move on to something else and forget about it. The agencies write the regulations, implement the laws however they want to, and your unsuspecting constituents find out the law they think was passed is something else entirely once the regulators write the regulations. That is why we need to change the views of some of the Washington bureaucrats. 
   I am not going to look the other way. I am going to make sure the agencies do what the new law requires them to do and what is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Several months ago, I asked the General Accounting Office to assess agency compliance with the provisions of the Reg Flex Act. Today, I am releasing GAO's report and findings. 
   While the Reg Flex Act has been the law for 18 years, GAO found that the agencies' knowledge of the actual requirements is lacking and that noncompliance is widespread. Agencies are failing right and left to meet the basic requirements of the law passed by Congress and enacted on a bipartisan, unanimous basis by the Congress in 1996. 
   Congress told them to look over the agency's regulations to see if there is any way we can change or eliminate regulations to make life easier for small business. That is all--just a review, just a recommendation. But they are not even doing that. 
   The GAO identified seven agencies that have consistently issued regulations affecting small business but have failed to conduct the periodic reviews required. What is the holdup? The agencies have thousands of employees. It seems the administrators might be able to use one or two of them to look at the regulations and see if any can be changed, particularly in this administration which touts its so-called ``reinventing Government'' plan. 
   Perhaps this award we are announcing today will remind them. Today I am awarding the ``Plumber's Best Friend Award,'' a plunger, to each agency which has failed to get the process moving, those agencies which need to unclog their pipelines and review existing rules. I am sending the head of each agency a letter explaining the requirements for periodic review and asking them to outline the steps they will take to get the agency in compliance. 
   And now for that moment you all have been waiting for. The winners of the first ``Plumber's Best Friend Award'' are: Department of Commerce, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, Department of the Treasury, Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   But the grand prize winner in my book is the Small Business Administration. Believe it or not, the agency whose mission it is to safeguard the interests of and to assist small business owners has failed to follow this small-business-friendly law. Think about it; SBA should be the advocate for small business at the Cabinet table, ensuring Government-wide compliance, not showing indifference to the law. I was stunned that the SBA cannot get a passing grade. 
   But it gets even worse. Nine other agencies completely failed to report to Congress by March 29 on their efforts to help small business as required in the act. All agencies that regulate small entities were to provide informal compliance assistance and penalty reductions for those small businesses seeking to comply in good faith. As we have learned, if we do not require progress reports, no progress is made. So we gave everyone 2 years to figure out how to do the right thing. But nine Federal agencies could not even get a report out on time. Ask yourself what happens to a small business woman running a business out of her home if she does not get an IRS, OSHA, or EPA form filed on time. They do not just overlook it; they come down on and crack hard on the small business. 
   The agencies failing to even report were the Departments of Defense, Justice, Veterans Affairs, the General Services Administration, the National Archive and Records Administration, the National Space and Aeronautics Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Control Board. 
   But, again, most outrageous among the nine agencies that missed the deadline: the Small Business Administration. In fact, when I brought this to the SBA Administrator's attention, the SBA's general counsel had the audacity to claim the SBA was not covered by certain provisions of the law because SBA was not a regulatory agency. So today I am sending another letter to SBA, explaining why they are covered by the Red Tape Reduction Act and calling on the Administrator to take immediate steps to comply with the law.

   Mr. BOND. For the Reg Flex and Red Tape Reduction Act to deliver the benefits intended by Congress, the agencies must comply with the law. It is that simple. Too many agencies, too many officials, unfortunately, in this administration seem to have the attitude that they are Olympians on the hill who know what is best for the peasants in the valley, when it really is the other way around. We should be listening to what the people who create the jobs and the economic well-being in our country, the small business sector, are saying. 
   Perhaps these plungers will help unclog things. But if sunshine and friendly persuasion will not work and if a plumber's friend cannot get it unclogged, it may be time to put civil penalties and fines in place so the agencies know we are serious. The job we are telling them to do is simple: Help small business, don't hurt it. If they will not do it, if the plumber's best friend won't help them, then we will change the law again and impose some penalties. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I join Senator DOMENICI in thanking my colleague, Senator ASHCROFT, for his very thoughtful comments on the budget. Those of us who work on the numbers sometimes get lost in the trees and fail to see the forest. But I thought the Senator from Missouri did a very effective job in explaining why this budget is so important to the working American in the average family who sits around the kitchen table and tries to figure out how to spend their money and wonders why those of us in Washington cannot spend our money with the same kind of discipline. 
   Today is April 14. It is an ideal time for us to consider this final version of the budget resolution. While so many of our constituents will be staying up late tonight to finish their own income taxes before tomorrow's deadline, we look like we are going to be able to meet an April 15 deadline of our own. The Congressional Budget Act created a deadline of April 15 for Congress to adopt its budget for the upcoming year, and this year looks like it will be only the second time since the Budget Act was adopted in 1974 that we in Congress will meet the deadline and will deliver a budget on time. I am sure many of our friends and colleagues and neighbors back home will be astonished to hear that. Taxpayers, those who are carrying the load that we are distributing, have to meet their April 15 deadline every year. I can understand their amazement, why we cannot seem to meet our April 15 deadline. Meeting the deadline is a major step forward in demonstrating to our fellow Americans we can be responsible in spending their tax money. I commend Chairman DOMENICI and all the conferees on doing whatever it takes to make that happen. 
   Senator DOMENICI is responsible for the discipline that this budget imposes on spending. Through his good efforts and with the cooperation of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they even met the time deadlines that were required as well. But, as our constituents put the final touches on their tax forms, it is important they be able to read in the papers about how their taxes will be spent next year. Adopting the budget at this time amounts to full disclosure. Taxpayers are sending in their checks. We need to deliver the details of what they are buying. This year I think the taxpayers will have less cause for buyers' remorse than in the past. 
   I think, when the American people heard what the President proposed in February, they probably wished their tax forms carried a money-back guarantee. Just think of what the President sent us and look how far we have come. The proposal made by the President would destroy the budget discipline that has helped us balance the books. It would have actually broken the spending caps by $22 billion in new budget authority and $30 billion in actual cash outlays. The conference report we have before us keeps to the caps and keeps to the discipline the taxpayers demanded. 
   When you listen to the President's budget, someone might get the idea that it really presented a sound fiscal plan. That is patently false. This budget that the conferees presented us saves more of the surplus than the President over the next 5 and 10 years. That is why we will have lower debt levels than the President's proposal, from the year 2000 to the year 2009, even if one adjusts for Social Security equity purchases. 
   This means the President's new spending is larger than our 
   tax cuts. You do not hear too much about that, but that is what the President proposed. We have heard great complaints about leaving options in the budget for tax relief for American families, but the President proposed to spend more than that, new spending already above what we already do. The President would spend 35 percent of the surplus over the next 5 years on programs unrelated to Social Security or Medicare. To do that, he would have to use $158 billion of Social Security's money to pay for them. 
   Our tax cut that we empower in this budget is smaller than the President's  new spending, which is why we felt it was essential that we save the entire Social Security surplus. The President's budget talks about 15-year budget estimates and talks about how much he would save over the extended period. When you talk about saving money down the line and spending it in the short term, I do not think you have to tell the American taxpayer what that is all about. 
   There is an old saying about ``a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'' The President front-loads his spending and says leave it to a future President to come up with more savings. I do not believe that dog hunts in my State or any other State in the Nation. That is not the way to go. 
   That is why I believe, when I introduced the President's budget as an amendment, for those who did not like the budget presented by the majority, the Republican budget, that the President's budget got a whopping two votes on the floor of the Senate. That was the President's budget, all his assumptions, what he wanted to do. People who said ours was so bad, our friends on the other side of the aisle, two of them voted for it. It was not a viable option. What we have presented is a good option. 
   The conference report, as I said, will save Social Security surpluses for Social Security. It keeps to the contract we have with our seniors and puts the ``trust'' back in the Social Security trust fund. I look forward to working with Chairman DOMENICI and, I hope, with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to create a formal lockbox to enforce this approach. 
   At a time when tax revenues are at their highest level since World War II, and income taxes are at an all-time high relative to our gross domestic product, the President proposed not to reduce taxes, but to increase them. The President's budget requested increased revenues $82 billion over the next 5 years. 
   That is 80 different revenue raisers, 80 different increases in taxes or fees or revenues. The conference report which we have before us today goes in the opposite direction by permitting Congress to fashion responsible tax policy. We could leave in the pockets of the people who do the work, who create the jobs, who create the products, the goods and services, some $778 billion between 2000 and 2009. 
   I have my ideas on how we need a flatter, simpler, fairer tax that will encourage economic development, but that is not going to be debated until we get around to the actual tax provisions. 
   I think, however, that all taxpayers should welcome the news as they work on their tax forms today and tomorrow that there is a hope there might be a little less taxes to pay in future years. It is also important to note that not a dime of that tax relief will come at the expense of Social Security. All of it will be funded from the non-Social Security portion of the surplus. 
   Let me cite one specific example of where this conference report makes a significant improvement over the President's budget. On a specific program that is of great concern to me, to the people of my State of Missouri, and I believe to people throughout the country, people who are concerned about a healthy environment, who want to see clean water, who want to clean up the wastewater that could carry pollution, that could carry damaging and dangerous illnesses that despoil our natural environments and put us at risk of waterborne diseases, the President proposed to whack $550 million out of the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund. 
   This program is not a very trendy one, it is not an environmental boutique program that sounds good in a press release, but it affects Missourians whether they drink water, whether they swim, or whether they fish. It means in the future that citizens in every State of the Nation can expect cleaner water. The funding is imperative for public health protection, for environmental protection, and economic growth. 
   During the Budget Committee markup of the budget resolution, I said these cuts would not stand. Chairman DOMENICI was able to restore a good chunk of the President's cuts, and I thank him for that. But in this conference report, I am hopeful we can restore even more of this crucial funding. 
   The conference report puts an additional $1.1 billion in the overall funding category for natural resources and environment for 2000. I will be working to try to get a good part of that for the State revolving funds. That is money that goes back to the people who are building the facilities, who are operating the facilities, who have had hands dirtied cleaning up the wastewater in this country and assuring that we have safe drinking water. 
   As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles the EPA budget, I am confident that the additional funding will be a crucial resource in restoring the funds the President slashed. 
   Mr. President, I am encouraged that as our constituents finish their tax returns and pay off their taxes, we do not have to be ashamed of how we will be using the money they worked so hard to provide their Government. In fact, we are going to be letting them keep a bigger portion of their money through tax relief in the future. We will protect our children and our grandchildren from the debts that come from excessive spending. 
   We will keep our promises to retirees who depend on Social Security--all of this signed, sealed, and delivered by the April 15 deadline. 
   This budget will put the trust back in Social Security. If there is any surplus remaining, we can give needed tax relief to working families. It will say that we need to rescue Medicare by making the structural changes in it that are needed, not by putting in the pot more IOUs that will be future debt burdens on our children. 
   We also made a commitment to reform education, to put decisionmaking back in the hands of parents, teachers and local schools. 
   We are able to have this debate about what to do with the surplus because we have some good things going for us in this country. Our overall economic activity is good. We have relatively low unemployment. We have steady growth. We have a stock market, for those people who are interested, that has gone out of sight. Why is that so? First, I think a sound monetary policy. We have had good monetary policy. We have kept inflation under control. We have avoided the hidden tax of inflation. 
   Secondly, after fighting long and hard, this Congress, through its majority, has gotten the President to accept the discipline on spending, to put caps on spending so that ``if we don't got it, we ain't gonna spend it,'' to put it in the vernacular. We have caps that keep spending under control. That means, like most Americans, we will not be spending money we do not have. 
   Congress and the President have to sit down and decide what our priorities are going to be, to take care of priorities without saying yes to every spending opportunity that comes along. It is going to take some tough decisions, and many of those tough decisions are still coming down the pike. But you tell a family that has to live within their budget that we have to make tough choices, and they will tell you, ``So, what's new? What's different between what we have to do and what every American family has to do?'' We have to establish that discipline. 
   Now is not the time to abandon the discipline and go back to the old ways of runaway spending. It seemed easy in the past to spend money that we did not have, to run up the debt, but when you think about it, we were running up the debt on our children's and our grandchildren's credit cards. That debt was building up for them to pay in the future, and it had a tremendously harmful impact on our Nation's economy. Poor fiscal discipline was holding our economy back. 
   With the Federal Government's budget under control, with sound monetary policy, with a promise that we are going to allow the taxpayers to keep more of their money that is not needed for the work of the Government, we have the conditions to allow the strong, free market economy to continue to grow, to create jobs, to create wealth, and to provide for the families of America, for the individuals who work hard and who are the people we are to serve in this Government. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with Senator DOMENICI. I appreciate his leadership. I hope that my colleagues will vote on both sides of this aisle for the budget so that we can get about the business of developing spending plans that comply with the  discipline of a balanced budget, one that augers well for the future of this country. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the second time in less than a year, the Senate is considering legislation to establish a pilot disaster mitigation loan program at the Small Business Administration (SBA). Last year, the Committee on Small Business voted unanimously to include a proposal to establish a disaster mitigation pilot program introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Senator CLELAND, as an amendment to H.R. 3412, the ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.'' H.R. 3412 passed the Senate on September 30, 1998; however, the House of Representatives was not able to consider the bill before Congress adjourned last fall. 
   As the Chairman of Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies, I have been concerned about our Nation's disaster relief program. I have worked at length with FEMA Director Witt and other Administration officials over the past several years to address the escalating costs of disaster relief and the need to tighten up this program. Since 1989, we have spent $25 billion on FEMA disaster relief, and there remains more than $2.6 billion in anticipated costs associated with open disasters. Much work needs to be accomplished to tighten the criteria for declaring disasters and eligibility for disaster relief funding, as well as stronger insurance requirements, so that we can bring these ever-escalating costs under control. 
   One way to mitigate against future disaster losses is to undertake preventive measures. Preventive measures to mitigate against future disaster losses, rather than the current strategy of response and recovery, could save as much as 50 percent of projected disaster relief loan costs.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I apologize, but I want to take a break from the fascinating discussions, the dissertations on autobiographical materials, and raise a new subject. I will talk about the budget. I apologize for making this major shift in the direction of the debate, but I am offering today the President's budget. 
   We offered this in the Budget Committee because a lot of people have been talking about the President's budget. Unfortunately, nobody has offered it here to date. I thought we ought to have an opportunity to discuss it. 
   Some of our colleagues waxed very eloquent in the Budget Committee on the benefits of the President's budget. Of course, people who know budgets know that they are just basically a bunch of numbers, but those numbers do have consequences. When people talk about how great the President's budget is, when it comes time to vote on it, nobody seemed to want to do that in the Budget Committee, so I thought I would give all of our colleagues an opportunity to vote. 
   As I look at the President's budget plan, it reminds me of the so-called garbage boat, the garbage barge that floated in the Atlantic a few years ago. Everybody kept saying how important it was to get the garbage buried someplace but nobody wanted the barge to land on their shores. A lot of our colleagues have talked about how important and how wonderful the President's plan is, but no one wants to take custody of it, nobody wants to take responsibility for it. 
   I suggest that this substitute would be a great opportunity for somebody who wants to work from the principles and the ideas of the President's plan to vote for it. Then we can move forward and work on it. 
   Why do our friends on the other side keep running away from the President's plan? The problem comes up when we move away from talking about general principles, platforms, and commitments and start talking about the details of the plan. I agree we ought to talk about principles, but principles are not enough. We have to get down to the point of talking about some plans, some numbers. 
   In the Senate, we vote on a plan, not on some vague statements claiming to be principles. I am from Missouri and, of course, our motto is ``Show Me.'' Show me how these principles translate into a budget. That is what this amendment is all about. This is putting before the Senate the actual numbers that the President has set out to implement the details of his budget plan outlined to us and to the Nation just a month and a half ago. It is a vote on the specific plan proposed by the President. 
   Now, let's take a look at what the President's plan does. This is just in summary, and there are a lot of things we can say about it. First and foremost, the President's plan breaks the budget discipline we worked so hard to achieve, the spending caps we agreed to in the balanced budget amendment that helped get control over spending and produced a surplus. These caps would be shattered by the President's plan. 
   We would not have any surplus to be worrying about if we had not, under the leadership of our distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, fought and fought and fought against plans that were vetoed, against objections from the other side, against every manner of obstacle, finally to get a plan in place which capped spending and produced a budget, where we are reducing the deficits and moving toward a surplus in the future. 
   This has been stated by many observers as one of the reasons why there has been some strength in the economy, because after years of watching a totally undisciplined Federal spending machine raise the deficit and build on the debt of this Nation, we finally are getting spending under control. 
   We have had good monetary policy. Our fiscal policy has been a disaster. Under the leadership of Chairman DOMENICI, we have finally gotten a handle on the fiscal policy. But the President's budget plan proposes to spend $30 billion more than we agreed to in the balanced budget amendment. He breaks the cap. This is going back to the old spend and spend and spend proposals that put us in the position where we have run up trillions of dollars of debt on our children's and our grandchildren's credit cards. 
   I think it is very important that we focus on the budget caps. The plan goes against the principles we supposedly agreed to around here. I was very interested that, on February 28, the distinguished minority leader was being questioned by Cokie Roberts on the ``This Week'' program. When asked if we should keep the caps, his response was, ``Absolutely.'' Cokie Roberts says, ``So you are against breaking the caps?'' Senator DASCHLE says, ``Absolutely. I think we've got to live within those caps. We set them out. We all voted for them, agreed to them. We knew the ramifications when we did so. We know what kind of a surplus we are going to enjoy if we have them. I think we ought to stick with them.'' 
   Well, that is a strong statement of principle in favor of the caps. I agree with it. But that principle is violated by the budget plan submitted by the President. That is why I think we are going to see a significant number of Members on the other side of the aisle vote against the President's plan, because the plan does not carry out the principles that he has so widely espoused and been so roundly cheered for espousing. 
   Here is another principle from the President himself. This is from the State of the Union Message, January 27, 1998. Within the first portion of the remarks, he said:  
   If we balance the budget for next year, it is projected we will have a sizable surplus in the years immediately after. What should we do with the projected surplus? I have a simple four word answer: save Social Security first. Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is, every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the measures necessary to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.  
   That was one time I was pleased to stand up and applaud the President, because I agreed with that principle. I agreed with the principle that we ought to take the money from the surplus, the surpluses we are seeing now, and apply them against Social Security. But what does the President's plan do? The President's plan, as outlined in the budget--you have heard about the devil being in the details. Man, that is an understatement when it comes to the President's budget, because it is full of devils. You can imagine what you call a place that is full of devils. There is a place named for that. That is what the President's budget is. The President's plan would spend a whopping $158 billion of the Social Security surplus on the President's big spending schemes.  
   Let me show you this chart. Here is an opportunity to take a look at the difference in the two plans. Here is the plan before us, Senator DOMENICI's plan, ``The Fate of the Social Security.'' It says here is the surplus. Here is the President's plan. He says we can save this much, and then we want to invest some in equities. I believe Senator ASHCROFT addressed that equity question. He wants to have the Federal Government investing in the stock market and taking control, 
   potentially, of companies through ownership--a new form of nationalization, a national economic scheme that would make a central planner of the Marx or Lenin era salivate with anticipation. And then the President wants to spend $158 billion out of that surplus. That, Mr. President, is not saving the Social Security surplus for Social Security. 
   These are some of the specifics of the plan. That is why we need an up-or-down vote on the President's plan, not on some vague statement by the President on the principles. That is why I have offered the plan. 
   Let's talk a little bit about Medicare. We have heard that the President does wonderful things about Medicare. Well, you know, I was very interested. I want to look at this because the President's plan cuts about $9 billion out of Medicare for the next 5 years to pay for new spending programs. 
   Mr. President, in my State, if you freeze hospital payments and you squeeze down on the money that the providers are getting, you are on the verge of doing something disastrous. Many of the small rural hospitals and rural health care providers in my State are at the point where they can no longer stay in business if the reimbursements are ratcheted down. The system has fatal flaws in it that need to be corrected. Throwing money at a fatally flawed system will not save it, and ratcheting it down further is going to wind up having small rural hospitals closed, having rural hospitals no longer able to take Medicare patients. It is going to wind up in denying Medicare to the people who most need it. 
   If we are serious about Medicare reform--and I hope we all are--we had better go to work on the recommendations made by the bipartisan members of the Medicare Commission, led by our colleagues, Senators BREAUX and KERREY on the other side, with the active leadership of Senators GRAMM and FRIST on our side, and others, because throwing money at Medicare is not going to save a system that is fatally flawed. 
   I wish to clear away some of the chaff that has been thrown out in discussions about Medicare by citing a fellow who I believe is a rather credible observer, David Broder. On March 15, he wrote an article that appeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, talking about the fury of some of the Finance Committee members in the Senate. He explained it. He said:  
   The committee had just received prepared testimony saying in unusually blunt language that Clinton, far from cracking the Medicare problem, may be making it worse. Dan Crippen, the director of CBO, said that by transferring $350 billion from the anticipated budget surpluses to the Medicare trust fund, the Clinton plan would ``delay the date of insolvency.'' 
   But the transfer would do nothing to address the underlying problem: ``Rapid growth in spending for Medicare.....will still outstrip anticipated revenues.''  
   Listen to what Broder said:  
   The prescription drug benefits Clinton touted (but left out of his budget because he has no way to pay for them) ``would be popular with beneficiaries,'' Crippen said, ``but the additional program costs would be large.''  
   Broder goes on to opine:  
   By raising expectations, Clinton has made the Medicare problem worse. 
   David M. Walker, the head of GAO, was even more biting. By proposing a large-scale shift of general revenues to a program now largely financed by payroll taxes, Walker said, the Clinton proposal ``could serve to undermine the remaining fiscal discipline associated with a self-financing trust fund concept.'' 
   Meantime, he said, ``it has no effect on the current and projected cash-flow deficits'' in Medicare and ``would not provide any new money to pay for medical services.'' The Clinton program, he said, ``does not include any meaningful program reform that would slow spending growth......At the same time, it could strengthen pressure to expand Medicare benefits in a program that is fundamentally unsustainable in its present form.''  
   There you have it. You have the President's budget plan, which is smoke and mirrors as far as Medicare goes. We have had the testimony before the Budget Committee from the Director of CBO and the Director of the General Accounting Office. It does nothing for Medicare. It provides some transfer of trust fund balances and shifts money back and forth with funny accounting. It gives new life to that old meaning that, ``I'm from the Federal Government, trust me. 
   I am going to shuffle notes around and claim that we have solved some problems.'' 
   The Clinton plan puts more IOUs into Social Security that will increase the debt held by the public. It is likely that the plan that he has presented will actually increase the debt that my son and the children and grandchildren of this country will have to carry for the rest of their lives. By raising the debt, it does nothing to save Social Security; it just increases the burden. Oh, yes. And taxes. At a time when we are looking at surpluses, he increases taxes so there will be more money to spend. This is a real plan. These are not principles. This is what his plan does. If there are some in this body who think that the President outlined the right way to go, I would say show me. Show me your support for it. Here is what it does. Show me if you are willing to vote for it. 
   Mr. President, I don't know a lot of our colleagues who want to endorse a plan like that. I certainly wouldn't. But I appreciate the opportunity to give them the chance to speak up for the President's plan. 
   I thank the Chair. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BOND. Thank you, Madam President. 
   This amendment is an opportunity for all of our friends who think that the President's budget outlines the plan which we should follow to express themselves by voting for it. The President has said we must save the entire surplus to save Social Security, but the actual details of the plan takes $158 billion out of Social Security over the next 5 years. 
   The President and the minority leader have said that we need to stay in the caps. This budget plan breaks the caps by $38 billion. These are the actual details. These are the actual plans and the absolute numbers that we think come from the President's budget. 
   For our friends who believe that the President's budget is a preferable means of charting our spending programs for this coming year, I say vote for this. 
   I believe it does not fix Medicare. It ignores Medicare. It spends money that should be put into the retiring debt from the Social Security surplus, and I urge my colleagues to vote no.

   Mr. BOND. Mr President, today we in the United States Senate have an opportunity to take an important step in strengthening the Women's Business Center Program at the Small Business Administration. The ``Women's Business Center Amendment Act of 1999'' authorizes SBA to make grants totaling up to $11 million annually to Women's Business Centers throughout the United States. 
   During the past decade, the number of women-owned small businesses has exploded. Women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing segment of our nation's business community. Years ago, there was an advertising campaign slogan proclaiming that women ``had come a long way.'' I find that slogan very applicable to the plateau now reached by women entrepreneurs. During this time, women business owners have established themselves as a key component of our small business community, which has been the engine driving our economy during the 1990's. 
   The research foundation arm of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) has conducted studies which show that women no longer are having more trouble than men obtaining bank loans. However, obtaining a loan does not guarantee a business' success. In fact, many small businesses that start out well capitalized end up failing. Success of a small business is usually dependent on the owner's management capabilities. Women's Business Centers offer help to women entrepreneurs who are looking to start a business or who already have a business by providing them with business and education training, including marketing, finance, and management assistance. 
   For the past three years, I have worked with Senator DOMENICI Senator KERRY, and members of the Committee on Small Business first to save and later to expand the Women's Business Center Program. In 1996, when the Administration sought to zero-out the budget for the program, I helped lead the effort to earmark funds for the program within the SBA FY 1997 budget. Senator DOMENICI, Senator KERRY and I sponsored the ``Women's Business Centers Act of 1997,'' which expanded the program from $4 million to $8 million per year. This bill was incorporated into the ``Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997'' (Public Law 105-135). 
   Last year, I sponsored the ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,'' which included an increase from $8 million to $12 million and made other reforms in the Women's Business Center Program. This bill passed the Senate unanimously; unfortunately, the House of Representatives was not able to act on the bill before Congress adjourned. In light of the pressing demand to expand the authorization for the Women's Business Center Program, I applaud the Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, JIM TALENT, and the Committee's ranking Democrat, NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, for their efforts to push through House-passage of the bill so quickly this year. 
   The ``Women's Business Center Amendments Act of 1999'' brings us a giant step closer to achieving our goal of having at least one Women's Business Center up and running in each of the 50 states. Under this bill, SBA will be able to continue to fund the existing 35 eligible Centers and provide seed funding to new eligible applicant Centers in states not yet served by the program. 
   The bill authorizes $11 million for Fiscal Year 2000 for the Women's Business Center Program; however, the Administration has requested $9 million. This summer I intend to work closely with Senator KERRY on legislation to allow Women's Business Centers that have completed their initial three or five year Women's Business Center grants with SBA to apply for another five year grant to allow them to be able to continue to provide the high level of service they are currently delivering to women small business owners. Our initiative may require an increase in SBA's budget for the Women's Business Center Program for FY 2000, and I intend to study very closely the financial needs of the program. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will urge my colleagues to support an increase in the FY 2000 budget for the program, if necessary, that will allow it to expand and meet the needs of the growing number of women-owned small businesses. I strongly believe we must pursue this course even if that means pushing for an increase above the amount requested in the President's budget request. 
   Mr. President, it is critical that the Senate vote to approve the ``women's Business Center Act of 1999,'' so that the Federal government can continue to help make small business ownership a reality for women entrepreneurs. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's kind words. I did a colloquy on the Senate floor last March on this issue with the then junior Senator from New York, Mr. D'Amato, outlining the funding needs of the Northeast. In that colloquy we discussed the fact that of the $250 million the Senate was appropriating for HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) , that $60 million was meant for Maine and the rest of the Northeast.

   Mr. BOND. Yes, the figure was smaller, but the fact remained that the Ice Storm, as the first big storm of the year, was the impetus for us to provide supplemental funding to the CDBG program to help Maine and other states cover the costs of the disaster where FEMA wasn't able to assist.

   Mr. BOND. As the Senator and I have discussed, I also was dismayed at the treatment Maine and the other Northeast states received--the fact that the money was not provided until six months after the bill was enacted, and the fact that I have yet to receive an acceptable explanation from HUD as to  the funding formula used to allocate the money. The Northeast's experience is one of several reasons why the bill before us today transfers the money to FEMA.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999. I am pleased to report the bill received unanimous support of my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business, when we voted to report the bill on February 5, 1999. This is important legislation for one simple reason: it makes more investment capital available to small businesses that are seeking to grow and hire new employees. 
   In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business owners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although investment capital is readily available to large businesses from traditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking investments in the range of $100,000-$2.5 million have to look elsewhere. SBIC's are frequently the only sources of investment capital for growing small businesses. 
   Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our Nation's best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at critical points in the early growth period for many companies that are familiar to all of us. For example, Federal Express received a needed infusion of capital from two SBA-licensed SBIC's at a critical juncture in its development stage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known companies, when they were not so well-known, such as Intel, Outback Steakhouse, America Online, and Callaway Golf. 
   What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program  provides to Main Street America Small businesses. These are companies we know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street companies provide both stability and growth in our local business communities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld Equipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufactures utility truck bodies in St. Clair, MO. The truck bodies are mounted on chassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Steelweld provides truck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., Texas Utilities, Paragon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet. 
   Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, Elaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk right out of high school. She rose through the ranks of the company and was selected to serve on the board of directors. In December 1995, following the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, Ms. Hunter received financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for Business (CFB) Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of Steelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt and seller debt were also used in the acquisition. 
   Since Mr. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was redesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, Steelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million and 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's experience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States. 
   In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the future of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the Committee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business Administration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure the future of the program. Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the growing demands of small business owners for debt and equity Investment capital. 
   Last year, the Senate unanimously approved a bill similar to the bill that is now before the Senate. Today's bill includes two technical changes in the SBIC program. The first change removes a requirement that at least 50 percent of the annual program level of the approved participating securities under the SBIC Program be reserved for funding with SBIC's having private capital of not more than $20 million. The requirement became obsolete following SBA's imposition of its leverage commitment process and congressional approval for SBA to issue 5-year commitments for SBIC leverage. 
   The second technical change requires SBA to issue SBIC guarantees and trust certificates at periodic intervals of not less than 12 months. The current requirement is 6 months. This change will give maximum flexibility for SBA and the SBIC industry to negotiate the placement of certificates that fund leverage and obtain the lowest possible interest rate. 
   The Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999 clarifies the rules for the determination of an eligible small business or small enterprise that is not required to pay Federal income tax at the corporate level, but that is required to pass income through to its shareholders or partners by using a specified formula to compute its after-tax income. This provision is intended to permit ``pass through'' enterprises to be treated the same as enterprises that pay Federal taxes for purposes of SBA size standard determinations. 
   The bill would also make a relatively small change in the operation of the program. This change, however, would help smaller, small businesses to be more attractive to investors. SBIC's would be permitted to accept royalty payments contingent on future performance from companies in which they invest as a form of equity return for their investment. 
   SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, which give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the equity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the small business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be payable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty feature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to attract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient to attract venture capital. 
   Lastly, the bill increases the program authorization levels to fund participating securities. In fiscal year 1999, the authorization level would increase from $800 million to $1.2 billion; in fiscal year 2000, it would increase from $900 million to $1.5 billion. The two increases have become necessary as the demand in the SBIC program was growing at a rapid rate. Higher authorization levels are necessary if the SBIC Program is going to meet the demand for investment capital from the small business community. 
   Mr. President, this is a sound bill, which has the unanimous support of all 18 members of the Committee on Small Business. On February 2, 1999, a similar version of this legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402-2. I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of the Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support to the resolution. For a long time now, the Palestinians and the Israelis have been negotiating a peace, based on compromise and a vision of peaceful coexistence. 
   These negotiations have been difficult, for both sides. But, they have progressed steadily towards an extraordinary agreement. One which could be a model for all the world to marvel. 
   A unilateral declaration by Chairman Arafat would destroy the advances he has made for his people in their quest for peaceful political and geographic autonomy. It is provocative, and it goes against every tenet of every accord to which he has affixed his signature. It would destroy any goodwill he has developed in this body because of his good faith negotiation with the Israeli Government. 
   I am proud that this body has the courage to stand up and voice its opposition to any unilateral moves by Mr. Arafat. I hope that he can see through the political fog he has created by floating this situation, which was made obviously in an effort to pander to radical elements. 
   As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I call upon all my colleagues to send a clear message that we could not accept such a declaration.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one year ago today, the Birth Defects Prevention Act passed the House of Representatives, clearing its way for the President's signature. 
   With this new funding, the Centers for Disease Control has implemented a national strategy, in conjunction with the States and local organizations such as the March of Dimes, to prevent the devastating incidence of birth defects. 
   Building upon that success, today I rise to introduce the Healthy Kids 2000 Act--comprehensive approach which addresses the broad spectrum of health issues affecting our nation's children. 
   And I want to thank the March of Dimes and the National Association of Children's Hospitals for supporting me in this effort to improve the health of our nation's children and pregnant women as we move into the new millennium.  
   I also want to thank my colleague from Ohio, MIKE DEWINE, for his work on children's health issues, and for allowing me to adopt some of his ideas for inclusion in this bill. Senator DEWINE has been a dedicated leader on children's health, and has been essential to the development of the sections of this bill that focus on poison control centers and pediatric research within the National Institutes of Health. 
   I am struck, every time I go into the neonatal wards across my home state of Missouri, at the tiny one and two pound babies, hooked up to monitors and tubes and looking so helpless. Many of them will survive; a few may not. My first thought is always one of thanks that I have been blessed with a very healthy son. 
   The good news is that we are making progress in preventing diseases and in making sick and injured children well. Healing never thought possible a few years ago for those who are burn victims, or born with birth defects, or trauma victims, or even cancer patients, now occurs on a daily basis around our country. 
   The question about how to finance health care and how to improve access to and the quality of health care, however, are the hottest challenges we face as a nation. 
   There are some things we can all agree on: that the care and well-being of our children should come first, particularly those who are ill. Prenatal care is also paramount, because a great deal of child health is determined in the womb. 
   Thus as a nation, we must stand up and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. 
   That is why I am introducing the ``Healthy Kids 2000 Act.'' The idea behind it is simple: we want pregnant women to be healthy, and we want children to be healthy. So we are going to remove some of the barriers they encounter in receiving good, appropriate health care. 
   This bill will give States the flexibility to enroll eligible pregnant women in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and to coordinate essential outreach efforts to enroll qualified children. This program has already been funded by Congress to assist 10 million children whose families lack health insurance. These children are eligible to receive basic health care services like immunizations and antibiotics for ear infections, but pregnant women are not now eligible. Since so much of a child's health is determined in the womb, it is imperative that low-income pregnant women receive quality prenatal care. 
   Similarly, we need to ensure that the National Institutes of Health research machine is focusing on diseases and conditions which afflict our nation's children, such as birth defects, SIDS, cystic fibrosis, juvenile diabetes, and arthritis, just to name a few. A simple statistic will highlight this need: 80% of prescription medications marketed in the U.S. today are not approved by the FDA for use by children under 12 because studies have not been conducted to document their safety or whether or not they work for children. That is a terrible disservice to the young people of our country who may need the relief of a particular prescription drug. 
   This bill will also consolidate programs and provide more funds for local initiatives to prevent birth defects and maternal mortality. 
   150,000 infants are born each year with a serious birth defect, and birth defects are still the leading cause of infant death. During the 1990s we have witnessed an increase in maternal death during pregnancy and childbirth. There is no question that we need better approaches to ensure that women have healthier, safe pregnancies, and healthier babies. And my bill will help fund these vital prevention strategies. 
   This bill will also ensure direct access to obstetric care, and direct access to pediatric care. Children have health needs that are very different than those of the adult population. Diseases and medications behave differently than in adults, and when children are treated, it should be by those who understand those differences. 
   Finally, this initiative will assist children's hospitals in educating the next generation of pediatricians. Even with strapped budgets, teaching children's hospitals offer the more egalitarian health care in this country. These hospitals turn no one away. And it is essential that we support this noble mission by equipping children's hospitals with the tools to continue their educational and research efforts. 
   So much of the most important work in our society goes unnoticed, and unrewarded. Saving the lives of our children, improving the health of our children, even caring for our children on a daily basis is not glamorous work, or sometimes even all that much fun. Doctors, nurses, mothers, fathers, child-care workers and teachers are performing the most difficult, and the most important, work of our society: raising up the next generation to be happy, healthy, and productive citizens. 
   We must assist them in their efforts, and we can take a positive step by debating and enacting Healthy Kids 2000.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleague from Alabama, Senator SHELBY, in reintroducing legislation, which we proudly offered in the 105th Congress and will work to enact during the 106th Congress. Our goal is to ensure that the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service does not usurp the power to tax--a power solely vested in Congress by the U.S. Constitution. ``The Stealth Tax Prevention Act'' will ensure that the duly elected representatives of the people, who are accountable to the electorate for our actions, will have discretion to exercise the power to tax. This legislation is intended to curb the ability of the Treasury Department to bypass Congress by proposing a tax increase without the authorization or consent of Congress. 
   The Stealth Tax Prevention Act builds on legislation passed unanimously by the Senate in the 104th Congress. As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I authored the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act--better known as the Red Tape Reduction Act--to ensure that small businesses are treated fairly in agency rulemaking and enforcement activities. Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act provides that a final rule issued by a Federal agency and deemed a ``major rule'' by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget cannot go into effect for at least sixty days. This delay is to provide Congress with a window during which we can review the rule and its impact, allowing time for Congress to consider whether a resolution of disapproval should be enacted to strike down the regulation. To become effective, the resolution must pass both the House and Senate and be signed into law by the President or enacted as the result of a veto override. 
   Later this month, I will commemorate the third anniversary of the Red Tape Reduction Act's enactment by highlighting the progress made to date and the obstacles small businesses continue to face primarily due to agency noncompliance. Because of the IRS' significant impact on the activities of small businesses, the Service's implementation of the Red Tape Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is of utmost importance to the Committee on Small Business. 
   The bill Senator SHELBY and I introduce today amends this law to provide that any rule issued by the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service that will result in a tax increase--any increase--will be deemed a major rule by OIRA and, consequently, not go into effect for at least 60 days. This procedural safeguard will ensure that the Department of the Treasury and its Internal Revenue Service cannot make an end-run around Congress, as it attempted with the ``stealth tax'' it proposed on January 13, 1997. 
   In that case, the IRS issued a proposal that is tantamount to a tax increase on businesses structured as limited liability companies. The IRS proposed to disqualify a taxpayer from being considered as a limited partner if he or she ``participates in the partnership's trade or business for more than 500 hours during a taxable year'' or is involved in a ``service'' partnership, such as lawyers, accountants, engineers, architects, and health-care providers. 
   The IRS alleges that its proposal merely interprets section 1402(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code, providing clarification, when in actuality it is a tax increase regulatory fiat. Under the IRS proposal, disqualification as a limited partner will result in a tax increase on income from both capital investments as well as earnings of the partnership. The effect will be to add the self-employment tax (12.4% for social security and 2.9% for Medicare) to income from investments as well as earnings for limited partners who under current rules can exclude such income from the self employment tax. 
   Under the bill introduced today, this tax increase on limited partners, if later issued as a final rule, could not go into effect for at least 60 days following its publication in the Federal Register. This window, which coincides with issuance of a report by the Comptroller General, would allow Congress the opportunity to review the rule and vote on a resolution to disapprove the tax increase before it is applied to a single taxpayer. 
   The Stealth Tax Prevention Act strengthens the Red Tape Reduction Act and the vital procedural safeguards it provides to ensure that small businesses are not burdened unnecessarily by new Federal regulations. Congress enacted the 1996 provisions to strengthen the effectiveness of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law which had been ignored too often by government agencies, especially the Internal Revenue Service. Three of the top recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business sought reforms to the way government regulations are developed and enforced, and the Red Tape Reduction Act passed the Senate without a single dissenting vote on its way to being signed into law on March 29, 1996. Despite the inclusion of language in the 1996 amendments that expressly addresses coverage of IRS interpretative rules, the IRS continues to bypass compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
   As 18 of my Senate colleagues and I advised Secretary Rubin in an April 9, 1997, letter, the proposed IRS regulation on limited-partner taxation is precisely the type or rule for which a regulatory flexibility analysis should be done. Although, on its face, the rulemaking seeks merely to ``define a limited partner'' or to ``eliminate uncertainty'' in determining net earnings from self-employment, the real effect of the rule would be to raise taxes by executive fiat and expand substantially the spirit and letter of the underlying statute. The rule also seeks to impose on small businesses a burdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information requirement that would affect  millions of limited partners and members of limited liability companies. The IRS proposed this ``stealth'' tax increase with the knowledge that Congress declined to adopt a similar tax increase in the Health Security Act proposed in 1994--a provision that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1994 would have resulted in a tax increase of approximately $500 million per year. 
   The Stealth Tax Prevention Act would remove any incentive for the Treasury Department to underestimate the cost imposed by an IRS proposed or final rule in an effort to skirt the Administration's regulatory review process or its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. By amending the definition of ``major rule'' under the Congressional Review Act, which is Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act, we ensure that an IRS rule that imposes a tax increase will be a major rule, whether or not it has an estimated annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000. Our amendment does not change the trigger for a regulatory flexibility analysis, which still will be required if a proposed rule would have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' We believe the heightened scrutiny of IRS regulations called for by this legislation will provide an additional incentive for the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service to meet all of its procedural obligations under the Reg Flex Act and the Red Tape Reduction Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important legislation to ensure that the IRS neither usurps the proper role of Congress--nor skirts its obligations to identify the impact of its proposed and final rules. When the Department of the Treasury issues a final IRS rule that increases taxes, Congress should have the ability to exercise its discretion to enact a resolution of disapproval before the rule is applicable to a single taxpayer. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act Senator SHELBY and I introduce today provides that opportunity.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to honor a very special person with whom many of us have worked over the years on a variety of technical and important issues. These issues have been and continue to be of great importance to the American consumer and the world marketplace. 
   I learned recently that John Hoffman, currently Senior Vice President of Sprint Communications, has decided to leave and remit the ongoing telecommunications debate to others. I think that what I, and others, will perhaps miss most, is the calm, rational and fair presence that John brought to the telecommunications debate here in Congress and elsewhere. 
   John has spent his entire career, some thirty years, with Sprint, helping bring it from a small local exchange company to a major state-of-the-art communications company providing services to millions of businesses and consumers. 
   Throughout John's career, which began in 1970 while John was still in law school at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Sprint was called United Telecom, he persevered through tough times and retained his vision of what the small company could become. I don't think there is any doubt that his ideas and efforts were right. 
   Sprint, today, is a global communications company at the forefront in integrating long distance, local and wireless communications services and one of the world's largest carriers of internet traffic. With John's help and diligence, Sprint built the nation's only all-digital, fiber optic network and is the leader in advanced data communications services. 
   John has been a good friend to me over the years. He should be very proud of his contributions to making Sprint the world class company it is today. 
   I wish the best to John, his wife Linda and daughter Heather. Good luck John, and feel free to call me--I know you have a phone.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come back to the floor to talk about Ed-Flex and the importance of that measure for the good education of our kids, and that is what we ought to be talking about. 
   We heard a lot of posturing. Everybody thinks the ideas that come out of Washington are great. Frankly, listening to some of the ideas, I think those are good ideas. If we were a great big United States school board, if we were making the decisions, if we had the responsibility and the authority of making decisions for educating our kids, these might be ideas we would adopt. In any event, they are good ideas to be talking about. 
   There is a real disconnect, and that is what the Ed-Flex measure begins to address. I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will let us have a vote on this very, very important bill. We need to move on. There are a lot more things we need to do in education beyond this. 
   I am going to have a very radical proposal to get the Federal Government strings off local education all the way. But I think Ed-Flex is a good bipartisan start, and it builds on a successful example that has been tried in 12 States. It is working. It is working because it gives the flexibility to local school districts to decide how they wish to use the money. 
   The people in the local schools--the school board members, the teachers, the administrators, the parents--know the names of the kids. They know Joe and Sally and Harry and Willie and Thelma and the kids who are being educated in that school district. They know what their challenges are. Some of the good ideas we have in Washington may not work in a particular school district. It may not be the right recipe. Who better to make the decision than the people who know the children, who know their potential, who know their problems? 
   I have found in meetings with educators and parents in every section of this State--in the metropolitan areas, in the urban schools, in the suburban schools, in the rural schools, in the big school districts and the small school districts--that there is one theme that has become a recurring and a growing crescendo. It is: The Federal camel's nose is under the education tent, and it is not doing good things. It is taking time away from the task of educating the kids. When a teacher has to spend hours writing a grant or a principal has to spend time to figure out if they are doing things the way the bureaucrats in Washington want them, he or she is not worrying about what is good for educating Sally or Tommy or Ralph or Cheryl or the kids who are actually getting educated. 
   I am very fortunate, my son is finishing up high school. We watched during his education; we wanted to know what was going on in the classroom, how was he working with his teacher. We as parents knew that. The people who run the local schools know that, but those coming up with great ideas in Washington have no idea of the names of the kids or what their problems are. 
   I thought maybe it would help my colleagues if I shared a 
   few of the stories we are getting from schools in our State. These are smaller schools. It does not matter what the size of the school is, the child who is in that school is just as important whether she or he is in a major metropolitan school district or in a small rural district. 
   Here is a letter from the superintendent of the Bismarck R-V School District. In part it says:  
   ..... In our small school of 700 students, we receive less than $15,000 in the combination of Title II, Title IV and Title VI funds. The restrictions on these funds make them very difficult to deal with for such a small amount of dollars. Some years we consider not using them, simply because the time and effort are not worth the small amount we receive. Removal of some or all of the restrictions would allow us to use the funding to better meet the needs of our school instead of spending the funds in the very restrictive designated areas of Federal funding.   
   Signed, Donald E. Francis, Superintendent, Bismarck R-V Schools. 
   North Mercer District R-3 Public Schools:  
   ..... As the system now works we are overwhelmed by federal and state forms and regulations. We also sacrifice many dollars to support federal and state bureaucracies that compound the forms, rules and regulations. 
   We encountered one program this school year with in excess of 150 pages of instructions. We would like to bring dollar, services and equipment directly to children for their educational benefit.  
   And one more. The Webb City School District R-7:  
   ..... Those of us who have spent a career in education have repeatedly experienced the jubilation of anticipation that arose from promises made by the Federal Government toward education. Unfortunately, however, excitement was then always tempered by the reality of the red tape that accompanied the promise. As the result, frustration was generally the only product forthcoming.  
   Signed, Ronald Lankford, Superintendent of Schools, Webb City School District R-7. 
   Mr. President, that is just a very small sample of the kind of response we are getting from our schools. I challenge any one of you here, any one of our colleagues, to go home and ask the educators who have the job--it is a wonderful opportunity, it is the most important job that we have in this country--of educating our students: Are the 763 different Federal education programs we have right now improving education? I get an overwhelming no. We have to worry about the Washington bureaucracy rather than the needs of the kids in our classrooms. 
   This reality has been recognized. The Nation's Governors--Democrat, Republican, and Independent--50 to 0, said, ``We want to expand Ed-Flex; we want the opportunity in all of the schools in this country to get rid of and cut away some of the bureaucracy and some of the redtape and put that money directly back to education.'' 
   There is bipartisan support for this bill. The bill has been supported by the President, by the Secretary of Education, both of whom were former Governors. I am a former Governor. I served with both of them, and we know the importance of education. But the decisions on how we spend the last dollar of Federal aid are not best made here, they are best made at the local school district level. 
   I really hope we can move forward and get this money directly to the schools, giving them the flexibility to use those funds where they are most needed. I urge our colleagues to allow us to do so and pass this bill and go on to the many other important issues involving education that we will be facing later this year. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time. 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank you very much. I will begin, although my colleague and my cosponsor on this measure is on his way over. Let me begin the discussion of this measure. 
   I thank my colleagues, Senators BENNETT and DODD, particularly for the work of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem communicating to both the government agencies and the private sector about the seriousness of the year 2000 computer problem. I look forward to their presentations to the Senate today on the potential economic and national security concerns that this problem raises. I also thank Senators BENNETT and DODD, and particularly my ranking member, Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, for their cooperation and valuable assistance in the drafting of this important piece of legislation. 
   As my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business and the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem know very well, the year 2000 computer problems may potentially cause great economic hardships and disruptions to numerous Americans and to numerous sectors of our economy. I am very pleased that the Senate has decided to make this problem one of its top priorities and has scheduled discussions on this topic early in the legislative session this year. It is commendable that the Senate is taking action on this problem quickly, and that we are taking action before the calamity happens, instead of after it occurs, which could otherwise be the case. 
   It is imperative that we move quickly on this measure. And I hope that we can work with our colleagues in the House to pass it and send it to the President, because by definition, since this is 1999, the year 2000 problem grows closer every day with the coming of the end of this calendar year. 
   The bill before us is an important step toward ensuring the continuing viability of many small businesses after  December 31, 1999. The bill will establish a loan guarantee program to be administered by the Small Business Administration that will provide small businesses with capital to correct their Year 2000 computer problems and provide relief from economic injuries sustained as a result of Y2K computer problems. Last year I introduced a similar bill that the Committee on Small Business adopted by an 18-0 vote and that the full Senate approved by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives did not act on the legislation prior to adjournment. I reintroduced the bill this year because the consequences of Congress not taking action to assist small businesses with their Y2K problems are too severe to ignore. My colleagues on the Committee on Small Business unanimously approved this legislation once again and I sincerely hope that we can pass this bill, and as I said earlier, that the House of Representatives will act on this legislation promptly. 
   The problem that awaits this country, and indeed the entire world, at the end of this year is that many computers and processors in automated systems will fail because such systems will not recognize the Year 2000. Small businesses that are dependent upon computer technology, either indirectly or directly, could face failures that could jeopardize their economic futures. In fact, a small business is at risk if it uses any computers in its business, if it has customized software, if it is conducting e-commerce, if it accepts credit card payments, if it uses a service bureau for its payroll, if it depends on a data bank for information, if it has automated equipment for communicating with its sales or service force or if it has automated manufacturing equipment. 
   Last June, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held hearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. The outlook is not good--in fact it is poor at best, particularly for the smallest business. The Committee received testimony that the entities most at risk from Y2K failures are small and medium-sized companies, not larger companies. Two major reasons for this anomaly is that many small companies have not begun to realize how much of a problem Y2K failures could be for them, and many may not have the access to capital to cure such problems before they cause disastrous results. 
   A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated 4.75 million small employers are potentially subject subject to the Y2K problem. The committee has also received alarming statistics on the number of small businesses that could potentially face business failure or prolonged inactivity due to the Year 2000 computer problem. The Gartner Group, an international information technology consulting firm, has estimated that between 50% and 60% of small companies worldwide would experience at least one mission critical failure as a result of Y2K computer problems. The committee has also received information indicating that approximately 750,000 small businesses may either shut down due to the Y2K problem or be severely crippled if they do not take action to cure their Y2K problems. 
   Such failures and business inactivity affect not only the employees and owners of small businesses, but also their creditors, suppliers and customers. Lenders will face significant losses if their small business borrowers either go out of business or have a sustained period in which they cannot operate. Most importantly, however, is the fact that up to 7.5 million families may face the loss of paychecks for a sustained period of time if small businesses do not remedy their Y2K problems. Given these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe economic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant in time and there are only 10 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on. 
   A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by the Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer in Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business depends on trailing

Given these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe economic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant in time and there are only 10 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on. 
   A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by the Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden Fields Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer in Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business depends on trailing technology purchased over the years, including 386 computers running custom software. Mr. Davis uses his equipment to run his entire business, including handling the company's payroll, inventory control, and maintenance of large databases on his customers and their specific needs. In addition, Golden Fields has a web site and sells the farm equipment it manufactures over the internet. 
   Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Davis is aware of the Y2K problem and tested his equipment to see if it could handle the Year 2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment and software could not process the year 2000 date and would not work properly after December 31, 1999. That is when Mr. Davis' problems began. Golden Fields had to purchase an upgraded software package. That cost $16,000. Of course, the upgraded software would not run on 386 computers, so Golden Fields had to upgrade to new hardware. Golden Fields had a computer on each of its 11 employees' desks, so that each employee could access the program that essentially ran the company and assist filling the internet orders the company received. Replacing all the hardware would have cost Golden Fields $55,000. Therefore Golden Fields needed to expend $71,000 just to put itself in the same position it was in before the Y2K problem. 
   Like many small business owners facing a large expenditure, Mr. Davis went to his bank to obtain a loan to pay for the necessary upgrades. Because Golden Fields was not already Y2K compliant, his bank refused him a loan because it had rated his company's existing loans as ``high-risk.'' Golden Fields was clearly caught in a Catch-22 situation. Nevertheless, Mr. Davis scrambled to save his company. He decided to lease the new hardware instead of purchasing it, but he will pay a price that ultimately will be more expensive than conventional financing. Moreover, instead of replacing 11 computers, Golden Fields only replaced six at a cost of approximately $23,000. Golden Fields will be less efficient as a result. The experience of Mr. Davis and Golden Fields has been and will continue to be repeated across the country as small businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will have on their business. 
   A recent survey conducted by Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Group on behalf of National Small Business United indicates that, like Golden Fields, many small businesses will incur significant costs to become Y2K compliant and are very concerned about it. The survey found that to become Y2K compliant, 29% of small businesses will purchase additional hardware, 24% will replace existing hardware and 17% will need to convert their entire computer system. When then asked their most difficult challenge relating to their information technology, more than 54% of the businesses surveyed cited ``affording the cost.'' Congress must 
   ensure that these businesses do not have the same trouble obtaining financing for their Y2K  corrections as Mr. Davis and Golden Fields Agricultural Technologies. Moreover, Congress must deal with the concerns that have recently been raised that there may be a ``credit crunch'' this year with businesses, especially small businesses, unable to obtain financing for any purposes if they are not Y2K compliant. 
   In addition to the costs involved, there is abundant evidence that small businesses are, to date, generally unprepared for, and in certain circumstances, unaware of the Y2K problem. The NFIB's most recent survey indicates that 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on taking action or do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry about. In addition, the Gartner Group has estimated that only 5 percent of small companies worldwide had repaired their Y2K computer problems as of the third quarter of 1998. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act that the Senate is considering today will serve the dual purpose of providing small businesses with the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000, and making lenders and small firms more aware of the dangers that lie ahead. The act requires the Small Business Administration to establish a limited-term loan program whereby SBA guarantees the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to assist small businesses in correcting Year 2000 computer problems. The problem will also provide working capital loans to small businesses that incur substantial economic injury suffered as a direct result of its own Y2K computer problems or some other entity's Y2K computer problems. 
   Each lender that participates in the SBA's 7(a) business loan program is eligible to participate in the Y2K loan program. This includes more than 6,000 lenders located across the country. To ensure that the SBA can roll out the loan program promptly, the act permits a lender to process Y2K loans pursuant to any of the procedures that the SBA has already authorized for that lender. Moreover, to assist small business that may have difficulty sustaining sufficient cash flows while developing Y2K solutions, the loan program will permit flexible financing terms so small businesses are able to service the new debt with available cash flow. For example, under certain circumstances, a borrower may defer principal payments for up to a year. Once the Y2K problem is behind us, the act provides that the loan program will sunset. 
   To assure that the loan program is made available to those small businesses that need it and to increase awareness of the Y2K problem, the legislation requires that SBA market this program aggressively to all eligible lenders. Awareness of this loan program's availability is of paramount importance. Financial institutions are currently required by federal banking regulators to contact their customers to ensure that they are Y2K compliant. The existence of a loan program designed to finance Y2K corrections will give financial institutions a specific solution to offer small companies that may not be eligible for additional private capital and will focus the attention of financial institutions and, in turn, their small business customers to the Y2K problem. To increase awareness of this program, I have already contacted the governor of each State to make them aware of the potential availability of the program. Moreover, so that we can state that we directed our best efforts to mitigating the Year 2000 problem, I am seeking to find other ways that the Federal government can assist State efforts to help small businesses become Y2K compliant. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to ensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a substantial number of small business failures following January 1, 2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing segment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield to my good friend and distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Small Business Committee.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, once again. His work on this measure, as so many others, and the work of his staff has been essential to assuring a product that meets the needs of small business and also deals with legitimate concerns which were raised initially by the SBA and others, and we are grateful to him for that effort. I thank him for his strong leadership and the very compelling case he makes. 
   Obviously, all the members of the Small Business Committee believe very strongly that small business needs some help, and we would love to have more people talking about the Y2K problem, but I should advise my colleagues, and those who are watching, that there is, as we speak, a hearing going on in the Y2K Committee where Senator DODD and Senator BENNETT are exploring some of the other issues. 
   This is really ``Y2K Day'' in the Senate because, as I stated in the opening, when we finish the vote on this measure--which I hope will be overwhelming in favor of it--there will be a confidential hearing regarding the Y2K issue in room S-407, and at 2:15 p.m., we will begin consideration of a resolution to fund this special committee dealing with the Y2K issues. 
   I noticed on one of the morning television shows that we are getting some good coverage and discussion in the media about the Y2K problem, and today certainly the Senate has explored in many, many different aspects how we can help smooth the transition to January 1, 2000, and beyond, when computers, if they are not fixed, might think that it is 1900 all over again. 
   Mr. President, we invite Members who want to come down to speak on this issue to do so. We hope they will have some time. We have 20 minutes more. And after, I may use some time on another matter, but I want to find out if there are other Members who wish to address the Y2K problem first. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is simple and clear. The only thing the bill does is to repeal the highway sanction provisions in the Clean Air Act. 
   I want to start by saying that I know what the so-called environmental community is going to say. Actually, they have already said it. I recall a press release that said, ``Another smoggy stealth attack is in the works,'' and ``sharpening the dirty-air knives.'' Well, that sounds fancy and exciting, but it is just flat wrong. 
   Mr. President, I ask you, where is the common sense? I do not want dirty air. And I do not think anybody in this room, in this body, wants dirty air. But any attempt to change the status quo gets some spinmeisters at work. 
   Let me explain where there is a real problem. There is a provision in the Clean Air Act that allows the EPA Administrator, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, to halt highway funding for a nonattainment area. For instance, if a State does not have an approved clean air plan, after a certain period of time sanctions apply, and those sanctions include halting highway funding. Now, transit funding can continue and bike path money can go forward. There is also a ``safety'' exemption where the Secretary of Transportation determines that a ``project is an improvement in safety to resolve a demonstrated safety problem and likely will result in a significant reduction in, or avoidance of, accidents.'' 
   I have several problems with that provision. 
   First, highway funding is a matter of safety. We dedicate transportation funds to specific improvement programs, like railroad crossings and programs on drunk driving. But highway safety is also an issue when it comes to road conditions. 
   In my own State of Missouri, I can tell you that highway fatality rates are higher than the national average because roads are more dangerous. In the period 1992 to 1996, 5,279 people died on Missouri highways. Nationally, Federal Highways estimates that road conditions are a factor in about 30 percent of traffic fatalities. Well, I believe that figure is higher in Missouri, because I have been on the narrow two-lane roads and have seen the white crosses where people have died. 
   Highway improvements, such as wider lanes and shoulders, adding or improving medians, and upgrading roads from two lanes to four lanes can reduce traffic fatalities and accidents. The Secretary can grant exemptions from the current law to allow a project to go forward, but he can also deny them. I have a problem with the Government, the Federal Government, micromanaging a State's transportation plan. 
   The law also says the State will have to submit data to justify that the ``principal purpose of the project is an improvement in safety.'' Tell that to the grandmother who has lost her granddaughter on a stretch of highway. She will never go to the prom, because she was killed on that highway. 
   I would argue that highway construction and improvements are almost always a matter of safety and that to have to seek an exemption is an unnecessary and inappropriate delay. Any further delay imposed by the Federal Government on highway projects which are necessary for safety is unacceptable. 
   Second, taking away or imposing any kind of delay on highway funding does nothing to improve air quality or to reduce congestion. According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, ``Congestion damages air quality, increases travel times, costs an estimated $43 billion annually in delays in the country's 50 largest urban areas, and generates additional delay costs in rural and suburban areas.'' 
   Some will argue, ``If you build it, they will come.'' That normally applies to baseball diamonds, but they are talking about highways. I am not denying that there is some truth to that, but congestion already exists. They are already there. People in our State and rural Missouri are driving, and they are driving on narrow highways because they have to. There are no trolleys; there are no regularly scheduled buses. Halting or delaying funds to address the problem is inappropriate. 
   I think the cliche, ``Pay now or pay more later,'' is appropriate. What we would be ``paying'' for is potentially the loss of life, loss of economic opportunities, and the loss of convenience for the traveling public. Isn't this an issue of quality of life? I think so.  
   Third, the Highway Trust Fund is supported by highway users for highway construction and maintenance. It is a dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose. The people of Missouri are paying highway fund taxes and not getting a full dollar back for their highways. And to take away some of the money that they have put in because of totally unrelated concerns is inappropriate as a punitive sanction. 
   The 105th Congress spent the entire Congress, almost, working on a transportation policy. 
   One of the most contentious debates we had at the time and the significant outcomes of that debate was the issue of the trust fund. The Congress finally agreed to and the President signed into law what I refer to as the Bond-Chafee provision which says that the money goes in as the money comes out the next year for transportation and programs authorized by law. 
   Included in TEA-21--highway dollars being spent on--is $8.1 billion over 6 years for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. This is money dedicated to helping States and local governments meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Under current law, CMAQ--as it is called--funding will continue without interruption, but highway construction could be halted or face a delay. 
   Using a ``dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose'' as a hammer in this instance is, I believe, inappropriate and unfair. 
   I do not view this legislation as an attack on the Clean Air Act. It is a matter of common sense. 
   Some may ask, if they do not already know, what precipitated the introduction of this legislation. I contemplated introducing this bill in the past but had other matters that were more important. But on November 8, 1998, the San Francisco-based Sierra Club filed suit in the District of Columbia District Court against the EPA to force the EPA to mandate sanctions not just on St. Louis and the nonattainment area but on the entire State of Missouri and to make these sanctions retroactive. That action, I believe, is irresponsible and extreme. 
   The EPA itself chose not to impose sanctions on the St Louis area or the State of Missouri because the State and the nonattainment area are doing everything that is necessary to come into compliance. The St. Louis area has adopted an inspection/maintenance program. They have instituted a plan to reduce volatile organic compound emissions by at least 15 percent. They have opted into EPA's reformulated gasoline program. And the St. Louis Regional Clean Air Partnership has been formed to encourage voluntary actions. In these circumstances, the Sierra Club lawsuit is purely punitive and purely unwarranted, but it is possible as long as we have this legislation on the books. 
   I do not personally know one Member of the Senate who fought for highway funding for his or her State's highway needs who would support actions to take that funding away, especially in a frivolous lawsuit by a group with a different agenda, with different priorities than the citizens of the State who are paying in the money. If this provision of law is left in place, what is happening in Missouri could happen elsewhere. Highway sanctions are in place for Helena, MT, and a situation is developing in Atlanta, GA, which has been brought to my attention. 
   There are those who say you can count the number of times highway sanctions have been imposed on one hand, but that still is too many. I disagree with the linking of highway funds and clean air attainment. We must address both. Quality of life requires both clear air and safe highways. I am dedicated to both. I hope we can have hearings and move on this measure in the near future.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his great leadership. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Ed-Flex because it gives States and local officials in 12 States now greater freedom from regulation in the use of Federal education dollars. We need to expand that. This is moving in the right direction. It is not all the way there. They should be encouraging innovation, creativity, and flexibility on the local level in regard to education. We should not be handcuffing teachers, principals, and others from trying to do what is right for the kids in their schools. 
   I think expanding Ed-Flex is a step in the right direction of putting our Nation's children first and not the red tape and bureaucracy. 
   Ed-Flex is a step in the right direction because it moves in the direction of putting decisionmaking back where it belongs, on the local and State level. It proposes consolidating funding and removing the strings that Washington has put on. 
   My colleague from Rhode Island has talked about his meetings with local educators in Rhode Island. Over the last 2 years, I have met with principals, teachers, superintendents, parents, and school board members in every section of my State. It is amazing what they tell me when I ask them about how our Federal programs are helping them. They say, ``They are burying us in red tape. We have to hire people to write grant applications, and to try to play `Mother May I' with the Federal Government. We are taking away time from our task, which should be educating our children and providing them with a quality education.'' They say that too many of them--if they fight and finally get a competitive grant for 3 years, that grant runs out and then they are faced with taking away money from their basic programs of providing quality education to fund a Federal program that was stuffed down their throats. 
   At our best count, we have about 763 Federal education programs. I challenge every single one of my colleagues to go back home and ask the educators: Do you really need 763 different Federal prescriptions? Are they really helping you educate your children? I can tell you that the response from my State is overwhelming, and I believe it will be from your States as well. 
   When we think about the tremendous waste in time and bureaucracy with 4,500 people in the DOE, the bureaucracy overseeing them, and 13,000 at the  State bureaucracies, those are dollars that are not going to the classrooms. Who is accountable for education? Are we as a Congress? I don't think so. I don't think anybody elected us to a national school board. Ed-Flex is moving away from the concept that we have come to Washington to be a national school board. 
   I say to you, to the President, and I say to the Secretary of Education: If you want to run local education, run for the school board, or be a superintendent or a principal. 
   Now, I hope we can pass this bill cleanly out of here and send it on to the President, get it signed. Let's expand on this program. I will tell you one thing for sure. If they start adding amendments to it, I have something called a ``Direct Check for Education.'' Direct check for education would put the money directly in the schools, not on the basis of a complicated formula, but on the basis of average daily attendance. I have explained that program to school districts throughout my State.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the direct check for education doesn't block grant education funds; it doesn't affect title I or include vocational education, special education, or Eisenhower Professional Development; it just says send the money directly back to the school districts, eliminating the time spent reviewing grant applications and the paperwork burden. It replaces a cumbersome and costly process with a resource of flexible funding. 
   Do we need 100,000 new teachers? In many small school districts, they figure it comes out to about .16 students for their entire district, or .1. How do you hire .16 teachers? Some districts may need to use that money to pay more so they can keep good teachers. This would allow them to do it. Some of my colleagues say you will take power away from the States and the States ought to be running it. I say the State regulations can still stay in effect, but the accountability is going to be at the local level. 
   We have school boards that we elect to take care of our educational needs and to make sure that our children get a quality education. I have a really radical proposal: Let's go back to the old system where school boards are responsible through the superintendents and principals and teachers and allow them to use the good ideas. We have lots of good ideas up here, and we ought to offer those voluntarily and say: Here is a good idea; do you want to try it? 
   The President just came up with a whole new series of standard things he wants to do for every school district in the Nation. They may well be good ideas. If you were a school superintendent, they might be just the thing to do. Let's suggest to them that these are things they might want to require. They may have a different way of going about it. I am willing to take the chance on putting that money in the hands of the people, the local educators who know our kids, know kids' names, and know their problems. 
   I believe Ed-Flex is a tremendous step in the right direction. I urge that we pass it without amendment. If we do start amending it, I am going to give my colleagues an opportunity to vote on sending the money directly back to the schools. Let's be radical, and let's do something that can make a difference. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, I do not intend to give a comprehensive statement, nor do I intend to use all of the time allotted. But I feel it is very important to answer some of the points that have been raised. And let me deal with just a few of those. 
   When I spoke to you in a previous session here, I mentioned the cover story, and said that while the cover story was not impeachable--the cover story which was admitted by counsel for the White House--it is a framework and a context in which we judge other actions. 
   Objection has been made by my friends primarily on this side of the aisle that on occasion we have cited evidence where the President may not have been truthful, and we may have raised other arguments that go beyond the boundaries of the articles of impeachment as grounds for impeachment. Let me hasten to add that I hope that no one would vote for a conviction on anything other than the items set forth in article I and the items set forth in article II. If there are other activities that may bear upon or indicate a pattern of conduct, that is one thing. But we must make our decision on the basis of that which has been presented to us by the House. 
   On the other side, we have heard some very spirited and enthusiastic attacks on the independent counsel and on the House managers and even on the Paula Jones case itself. Let me make just a few points. 
   No. 1, we threw Judge ALCEE HASTINGS out of office as a judge for lying in a grand jury proceeding where he was not convicted. The objective is not to say that you can only commit perjury when a case is won or someone is convicted. 
   No. 2, the independent counsel got into this because the attorney general felt that there were grounds to pursue the potential violations of law by the President in the Monica Lewinsky case. And a three-judge court agreed, and the independent counsel was assigned to pursue this. 
   Whatever you may think about what the House did, or what the Paula Jones attorneys did, or what the independent counsel did, that is not the question before us. That can be addressed, as some of my colleagues said, if there are investigations by the Department of Justice on improper activities by the OIC. Let that proceed in its own realm. We are here to judge on the evidence before us. 
   As I said, we have a cover story. We have a cover story that was utilized regularly throughout by this President and by Monica Lewinsky. 
   Objection has been made that, while we have the clear testimony that William Jefferson Clinton never said you should lie, he never said expressly you should file a false affidavit. Well, of course, he didn't. Of course, he didn't. He is a very sophisticated, very able lawyer. And, if you are concocting a scheme to obstruct justice, you don't tell somebody who is to be part of that scheme with you that you should lie under oath, that you should file a false affidavit because those people might just get called to testify under oath at some point, as they were in this case. But Mr. Clinton didn't have to do that, because Monica Lewinsky understood very clearly that she was to stay with the cover story until she was told not to. She filed the false affidavit that he sought. He and his counsel used it in the deposition. 
   Why was it filed? To keep him from having to testify truthfully in the deposition. Was he surprised by it? I do not believe it has one iota of credibility to say that after he went out and procured that false affidavit, he didn't know that his attorney was going to use it, and he was not going to rely on it. He got her to do the felonious deed of filing a false affidavit so he could avoid the danger of having to lie himself in a deposition. 
   Mr. Clinton didn't engage in a conspiracy with his lawyer, Mr. Bennett. We hear about the one-man conspiracy. No. He foisted that on his attorney. And Mr. Bennett, when he found out about the falsity of that affidavit, had to do what no attorney ever wants to do--he had to write a letter to the judge, and say, ``Disregard it. Disregard it. I was part, inadvertently, of a scheme to defraud the court.'' And you notice he is not in the case any longer. He could not be part of that. 
   We know that Mr. Clinton enlisted his loyal secretary to violate the law to go pick up gifts, and she and Monica Lewinsky, once again, committed felonies to continue the story to protect the President. And the gifts wound up under Betty Currie's bed. 
   Mr. Clinton went to Betty Currie on a Sunday and 2 days later and told her things that he hoped she would say before the grand jury. He told his other subordinates things that he hoped they would say. He even trashed her when it appeared that she might be a hostile witness. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I suggest to you that when you have this clear-cut evidence of a scheme carried out with direct evidence, testimony of Monica Lewinsky and others, Betty Currie and his subordinates, an Audrain County jury would not have any trouble finding him guilty of tampering with a witness or obstructing justice.

   Mr. BOND. On Friday, February 12, 1999, I voted to convict President William Jefferson Clinton on both counts of the Impeachment Articles brought by the United States House of Representatives charging that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice. My reasons follow. 
   BACKGROUND
   On January 16, 1998, at the request of the United States Attorney General Janet Reno, the three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expanded the previously entered Order authorizing the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr to look into certain matters relating to a lawsuit brought against President William Jefferson Clinton by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones alleging sexual harassment. Pursuant to that Order, Ms. Jones' attorneys issued subpoenas for evidence and deposed Mr. Clinton and others seeking information on a pattern of conduct that might be relevant to the issues in the Jones case. 
   The President denied in a deposition in the Jones case and in a forceful statement to the American public that he had sexual relations with ``that woman,'' referring to Monica Lewinsky. Subsequently, however, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a stained blue dress that she had worn in an encounter with the President; a scientific examination revealed that the DNA on the dress was President Clinton's DNA. 
   The Office of Independent Counsel convened a federal grand jury to look into the matter and deposed Mr. Clinton in The White House on August 17, 1998, about his participation in the Jones lawsuit. 
   The Office of Independent Counsel then referred the matters developed in the investigation to the United States House of Representatives, which on December 19, 1998, voted two Articles of Impeachment against Mr. Clinton alleging that he committed perjury before the federal grand jury in four instances and that on seven occasions he had obstructed justice by tampering with witnesses and evidence in the Jones case proceedings. 
   For the sake of brevity, I shall only cover several of the allegations and evaluate the evidence supporting them. 
   ALLEGATIONS
   Counsel for the President has admitted that there was an inappropriate relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky and that they had concocted a cover story to conceal their relationship and activities. On December 17, 1997, at approximately 2 a.m., Mr. Clinton telephoned Ms. Lewinsky after he learned that she had been summoned for a deposition in the Jones case. According to this testimony he called to tell her of the death of the brother of Mr. Clinton's secretary. Ms. Lewinsky states that he told her about the death of the brother, but that he also reminded her of their cover story and notified her that she was included on the witness list in the Jones case. 
   According to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Mr. Clinton further stated that they might be able to avoid her testimony if she executed an affidavit. Although Mr. Clinton had also reminded Ms. Lewinsky of her cover story, the White House Counsel made much of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky said that the President did not tell her to file a false affidavit and did not link the cover story to the need to file an affidavit. 
   I do not believe it is at all inconsistent with a scheme or out of the ordinary to note that the President would not make such a connection. As an experienced attorney, the President would know he would be in grave danger if he ever explicitly asked anyone to file a false affidavit or to lie under oath. To paraphrase a statement made  during the trial by Vernon Jordan, ``He is no fool.'' He would have known that such a statement could be revealed by subsequent judicial inquiry. 
   Mr. Clinton did not have to tell Ms. Lewinsky expressly to execute a false affidavit. She knew that in the absence of contrary instructions she was to continue to follow their story. She was referred by the President's best-friend Vernon Jordan to an attorney who drafted the affidavit for her. The President, through Mr. Jordan, was kept advised of the progress of the affidavit. 
   During the time that Mr. Jordan was serving as liaison between the attorney and the President in the procuring of the affidavit, he was also pursuing a job search for Ms. Lewinsky, which he admitted was under his control. 
   The President's lawyer was presented the affidavit and offered it into the evidence when the President was summoned before federal judge Susan Webber Wright to participate in the deposition on January 17, 1998, by the Jones attorneys. The President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, referred to the deposition in evidence and stated that it showed that there ``is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form'' with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Bennett further stated, ``In preparation of the witness for 
   this deposition, the witness (Mr. Clinton) is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, for I have not told him a single thing he doesn't know .*.*.*.'' (Clinton deposition transcript, Evidentiary Record, Vol. XIV, at p. 23.) Although the videotape of the deposition showed the President looking in the direction of the attorney when the affidavit was presented, Mr. Clinton subsequently stated that he was not paying attention and had no knowledge of the representations made by his attorney about the affidavit. 
   I believe that to be totally incredible. 
   The President had known that Ms. Lewinsky would be a prime subject of the deposition and he had asked Ms. Lewinsky to file an affidavit and took steps to be kept advised of the progress of that affidavit. Subsequent events showed that his attorney, Mr. Bennett did not at the time know the falsity of the affidavit and that Mr. Clinton was apparently the only one at the deposition who was fully aware of the fraud that was being perpetrated on the court. 
   When Mr. Bennett later learned the falsity of the affidavit, he did what any attorney hates to do and that is to advise the court that he provided false information. He asked that the affidavit and his characterization of it be disregarded. 
   I believe Mr. Clinton encouraged the execution of a false affidavit, secured job assistance to help prevent truthful testimony, and allowed his attorney to make false statements as alleged in Article II, paragraphs 1, 4, and 5. 
   When Mr. Clinton testified before the federal grand jury on August 17, 1998, he was asked:  
   A. If he misled Judge Wright in some way then you would have corrected the record and said, excuse me Mr. Bennett, I think the judge is getting a mis-impression by what you are saying? 
   A. ......I wasn't even paying much attention to this conversation. 
   Q. Do you believe, Mr. President, that you have an obligation to make sure that the presiding federal judge was on board and had the correct facts? 
   A. I don't believe I ever even focused on what Mr. Bennett said in the exact words he did until I started reading this transcript carefully for this deposition.--(Deposition of President Clinton, page 30, lines 2-5.) 
   I therefore believe he provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the Federal grand jury concerning statements he allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge as alleged in Article I, paragraph 3. 
   On December 28, 1997, the President met in his White House office with Ms. Lewinsky and exchanged gifts. During the course of the conversation Ms. Lewinsky raised the question of what to do with other gifts he had provided her and which had been subpoenaed by the attorneys for Paula Jones. According to Ms. Lewinsky, he made no definitive statement about the gifts. 
   Very shortly thereafter, according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Mr. Clinton's personal secretary Bettie Currie initiated a series of telephone conversations, in which in effect Ms. Currie communicated to Ms. Lewinsky that she understood from the President that Ms. Lewinsky had something for her. Pursuant to those telephone calls Ms. Currie picked up gifts from Ms. Lewinsky and took them back to Ms. Currie's apartment where she stored them under her bed. 
   During the course of proceedings in the Senate, Ms. Lewinsky was asked in a deposition about these telephone calls and expanded upon her testimony about them. A prior statement by Ms. Currie that Ms. Lewinsky had actually initiated the call was recanted by Ms. Currie, and I believe the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky is credible. By hiding the gifts rather than presenting them to the Jones attorneys pursuant to the subpoena Ms. Lewinsky committed a felonious act and, if Ms. Currie had knowledge of the subpoena, she also committed a felonious act of concealing materials covered by a valid subpoena. Mr. Clinton, by orchestrating, facilitating, and encouraging the suppression of evidence under subpoena, also committed a felonious act. I, therefore, believe that the charge in Article II, paragraph 3, of the Impeachment Articles is proven. 
   During the course of his deposition by the Jones attorneys, President Clinton continued to rely on his cover story and on the perjurious affidavit submitted by Ms. Lewinsky. During that deposition he referred repeatedly to Ms. Currie as one who would corroborate the cover story which he and Ms. Lewinsky had devised. Immediately after his testimony on Saturday, January 17, 1998, he called Ms. Currie and summoned her to come into his office on a Sunday, January 18, 1998. There he stated five rhetorical questions to Ms. Currie: (1) ``I was never really alone with her ..... right?''; (2) ``You were always there when Monica was there ..... right?''; (3) Monica came to see me and I never touched her right ..... right?''; (4) ``She wanted to have sex with me and I can't do that ..... ?''; (5) ``You could see and hear everything ..... right?'' 
   Each of these statements supported the position taken by the President in the Jones deposition, but each one of these statements was false. The President was transmitting to Ms. Currie what he wanted her to say should she be called as a witness in this case. For good measure, he even went back to her a couple of days later and walked her through the statements again. It is uncontroverted that he made those statements, but he attempted to justify them on the basis that he was trying to refresh his memory. 
   His statements to Ms. Currie on January 18, 1998, and several days later constituted relating a false and misleading account of relevant events to influence corruptly the testimony of a witness in a federal civil rights action as alleged in Article II, paragraph 6, of the Impeachment proceedings. 
   Subsequently, he also made statements to his subordinates including Sidney Blumenthal, John Podesta, and Erskin Bowles. The statements he made to them were also known by him to be false and were designed to provide misleading information through them which could be and subsequently was transmitted under oath in the judicial proceedings by the subordinates. 
   His statements to his subordinates on January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, were false and misleading statements to potential witnesses in a federal grand jury proceeding to influence corruptly the testimony of those witnesses as alleged in Article II, section 7, of the Articles of Impeachment. 
   At his federal grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, Mr. Clinton falsely and corruptly denied he had attempted to influence the testimony of witnesses and impede the discovery of evidence in civil rights actions as set out in the analysis above. Thus, the committed the acts as charged in Article I, paragraph 4, the count charging perjury. (See Clinton grand jury transcript at 107-08, Evidentiary Record, Vol. III, Part 1 of 2, pp. 559-60.) 
   I believe that the evidence presented on the above charges was clear and convincing that the President engaged in a continuing scheme to fabricate and establish in federal court proceedings a false story about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that through circumstantial evidence, the direct testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie, Mr. Blumenthal, and others, plus the corroborating evidence, he was shown to have committed the acts charged. 
   The totality of his actions can be judged in the success with which he  maintained his cover story. Had it not been for the DNA on the stained dress, there is little likelihood that the false cover story would have been exposed for the lie that it was. In perpetrating that false and misleading story Mr. Clinton 
   tampered with witnesses, obstructing justice in the civil rights lawsuit brought against him by Paula Jones. He also falsely misrepresented these acts in testimony before the grand jury August 17, 1998.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, February 27 is the 150th anniversary of the founding of William Jewell College, a small liberal arts college in Liberty, Missouri, and one of the oldest four-year colleges west of the Mississippi River. 
   William Jewell's reputation is far larger than its size. Because of the quality of its academic programs and facilities, and the breadth of its student and public service activities, Jewell is recognized as a preeminent liberal arts college in the Midwest. Jewell is classified among the nation's top 162 liberal arts colleges by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Jewell has been recognized in the prestigious ``National Liberal Arts'' category in the ``America's Best Colleges'' edition of U.S. News & World Report. 
   Affiliated with the Baptist church since its founding, the college places a strong emphasis on Christian values, character development, and public service. Jewell is listed regularly in the Templeton Foundation's Honor Roll of Character-Building Colleges. 
   The institution has awarded more than 14,000 baccalaureate degrees since its founding. While most of its students are from Missouri, the school attracts students from nearly half of the 50 states and more than a dozen foreign countries. 
   Alumni accomplishments at the highest levels of business, industry, government and the professions figure prominently in maintaining Jewell's reputation as a preeminent liberal arts college. And the college is frequently referred to as the ``Campus of Achievement'' due to the high percentage of Jewell students appearing in annual ``Who's Who'' directories. 
   And, on a personal note, Jewell graduates are certainly overrepresented on my Senate staff in terms of their percentage of the Missouri population! 
   While the school has a right to be proud of its achievements, what sets it apart from other colleges are the opportunities it offers all of its students, and the larger Kansas City community. William Jewell's Fine Arts Program, now in its 34th season, is a regional and national treasure, having presented  Luciano Pavarotti's American recital debut in 1973. Each year, the Fine Arts Program brings to Kansas City venues internationally acclaimed orchestras, ensembles, dance troupes, plays, musicals, and individual performers. 
   International programs in England, Japan, Australia, India and Ecuador give students the opportunity to travel widely and study at some of the world's great centers of learning. The recently endowed Pryor Leadership Studies program is a unique curriculum of course work, activities and lectures which actively promote personal, vocational and civic leadership development. And a Service Learning certificate program, sustained by its own endowment, encourages formal involvement in community service activities, along with national and international outreach, and mission trips. 
   It is a credit to her faculty, administration, board, alumni, and students that William Jewell has been able to maintain high academic standards through the years, and to serve so well the Kansas City community, the State of Missouri, and the entire nation. 
   I offer the entire William Jewell community a heartfelt congratulations on their first 150 years!

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. I have just a few brief thoughts on this budget that has been submitted to us. The President's budget says we are going to have about a $4 trillion surplus over the next 15 years. He has said, and we agree, that we should fix Social Security first. We are going to do that. He believes that we ought to set 62 percent of the surplus aside for fixing Social Security. Again, we agree, because that is about what Social Security receipts are provided. 
   But when we got his budget message and when we heard his State of the Union, we didn't see a fix to Social Security. We saw new gimmicks, financial gimmicks, borrowing more money. And under this plan that he has presented, while we are supposedly running these surpluses that will amount to $4 trillion, we are going to have to raise the debt ceiling within a couple of years because he is issuing more bonds. We are going to borrow our way into solvency for Social Security. Nobody has explained yet how that is going to work. But it is clear that he has not proposed any responsible reform of the Social Security system to make sure it is there. We in Congress are going to have to develop a plan. I believe we will. It is going to take some of the surplus, 62 percent. I think that we must do that because we owe that not only to those who are retired now and those who are about to retire, but to the baby boomers and others coming along who want to see retirement security. 
   So we have 38 percent. What do we do with the remaining 38 percent of the surplus? I have spent a lot of time. I traveled around the State of Missouri many, many days listening to and talking with people, telling them: We finally got that budget deficit monster slain. What should we do with the surplus we are going to start running? And they had two very strong ideas. They said, No. 1, pay off the debt. We started to pay off the debt. If it hadn't been for the President's having invested some $20-plus billion in spending last year, we would have paid off $20 billion more. 
   Frankly, around this place there is nothing quite so tempting as an unspent surplus. If you don't return it to the taxpayers, it is going to get spent. We already have a historically high tax rate as part of our gross domestic product, the highest it has been since the end of World War II. And we are continuing to take more and more money. We need to have tax relief. That is the other thing that the people of Missouri say: We want tax relief; lower, simpler, flatter taxes. 
   Small businesses spend 5 percent of what they take in just figuring out how much they are going to have to pay in taxes. That is before they pay taxes. It is too complicated. It is too high. It discourages economic activity. Those who made fun of the capital gains tax relief and objected to it now have to admit that reducing capital gains brought more economic activity and brought a tremendous increase in capital gains revenue. If we give families and small businesses the opportunity to keep some of their money, do you know what? They can spend it better than we can in Washington, and that is what I propose we do. 
   But the President is not content with a $4 trillion surplus. He wants to increase Federal Government revenues by raising taxes. And on top of that, he is going to spend it all, he is going to spend more of it, he is going to spend $100 billion in new spending. He busts the cap. He even raids the tobacco settlements from the States because he has so many good 
   ideas on how to spend it. 
   Mr. President, I do not believe the people of America want those good ideas. It is unbelievable, $4 trillion in  surplus yet every dollar of it spent, then more taxes are added. This is a classic example of the Federal ``Father Knows Best,'' requiring the States, localities, and most of all the families, the working men and women in America, to play ``Mother May I?'' 
   Let's take a look at education, something I think is a top priority, and the President says it is a top priority, too. It is about that point where we diverge 180 degrees. The President wants to be your local school superintendent. Do you know, we have over 763 Federal education programs. The system is not working now. We have too much Federal bureaucracy, too much Federal red tape. Yesterday the President told the school board members who were in town from school boards all across the country, he said, ``Listen to what they are saying in the schools.'' I have. Do you know what they are saying? Do you know what educators and the administrators and school board members are saying? ``We have too much Federal regulation and dictates. We spend too much time on misplaced Federal priorities.'' 
   That is why I want, and I think my colleagues want, to return dollars directly to the classroom. Do not run it through the bureaucracy in Washington, DC. Don't even run it through the State bureaucracies. It is the school districts that have to make the decisions. They are the ones that know the kids' names. They are the ones that know the strengths of the kids. They are the ones that know the challenges they face. Let them make the decisions and take the Federal handcuffs off of local educators.

   Mr. BOND. One final item I need to get in. Last year, we worked very hard for a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, or TEA 21. I led the fight with Chairman JOHN CHAFEE and Chairman JOHN WARNER to make sure we put the trust back in trust fund; that is, we told the American people that we would send back, for highways, the money in the trust fund as it increased. In this budget he proposes more boutique programs. He wants to go back on the promise we made last year. We have great highway needs and there is absolutely no reason to get more Federal programs when it is the States who need to build the highways. We need to start over again on transportation and education and make some sense out of this budget.

   Mr. BOND. 
   Mr. President, small businesses today face enormous burdens when it comes to taxes. Each year they pay a growing portion of their revenues on income, employment, and excise taxes. Yet even before they write the tax check, they spend more than 5% of their revenues just to comply with the tax laws. These revenues are spent on accountants, bookkeepers, and lawyers to sort out the countless pages of tax laws, regulations, forms, instructions, rulings, and other guidance published by the IRS. In addition, small business owners must dedicate valuable time and energy on day-to-day recordkeeping and other compliance requirements, all of which keep them from doing what they do best--running their business. 
   As the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have heard from small business owners in Missouri and across this country that they are more than willing to pay their fair share of taxes. But what they object to is paying high tax bills and vast amounts for professional tax assistance only to end up the victim of an unfair tax code. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will eliminate two major sources of that unfairness and provide a level playing field for the millions of men and women who work exceedingly hard to make their small enterprises a success. These bills are common-sense measures that respond to the calls from small businesses for tax fairness and simplicity. 
   My first bill, the ``Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of 1999,'' will end one of the most glaring inequities that has existed in our tax law--the deductibility of health-insurance costs for the self-employed. For nearly five years, I have been working to see that the self-employed receive equal treatment when it comes to the deductibility of health insurance. 
   During the 105th Congress, we made substantial progress. First, in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we broke through the long-standing cap on the deduction to provide 100% deductibility. Then, last Fall, we passed legislation that will speed up the date that self-employed persons can fully deduct their health-insurance costs to 2003. We also significantly increased the deductible amounts in the intervening years over the prior law. While I strongly supported these improvements, the self-employed still cannot wait four more years for 100% deductibility when their large corporate competitors have long been able to deduct such costs in full. 
   With the self-employed able to deduct only 60% of their health-insurance costs today, it comes as no surprise that nearly a quarter of the self-employed still do not have health insurance. In fact, five million Americans live in families headed by a self-employed individual and have no health insurance. And those families include 1.3 million children who lack adequate health-insurance coverage. 
   Mr. President, it is time to finish the job once and for all in this Congress. My bill will increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed to 100% beginning this year. A full deduction will make health insurance more affordable to the self-employed and help them and their families get the health insurance coverage that they need and deserve. 
   The ``Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act'' also corrects another inequity in the tax law affecting the self-employed who try to provide health insurance for themselves, their families, and their employees. Under current law, the self-employed lose all of the health-insurance deduction if they are eligible to participate in another health-insurance plan--whether or not they actually participate. 
   This provision affects self-employed individuals like Steve Hagan in my hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Mr. Hagan is a financial planner who runs his own small business. Although he has a group medical plan for his employees, Mr. Hagan cannot deduct the cost of covering himself or his family simply because his wife is eligible for health insurance through her employer. The inequity is clear. Why should he be able to deduct the insurance costs for his employees but not for himself and his family? What if the insurance available through his wife's employer does not meet the needs of their family? 
   Besides being patently unfair, this is also an enormous trap for the unwary. Imagine the small business owner who learns that she can now deduct 60% of her health-insurance costs this year, and with the extra deduction, she can finally afford a group medical plan for herself and her employees. Then later in the year, her husband gets a new job that offers health insurance. Suddenly, her self-employed health-insurance deduction is gone, and she is left with two choices. She can bear the entire cost of her family's coverage, or terminate the insurance coverage for all her employees. The tax code should not force small business owners into this kind of ``no win'' situation when they try to provide insurance coverage for their employees and themselves. 
   My bill eliminates this problem by clarifying that the self-employed health-insurance deduction is limited only if the self-employed person actually participates in a subsidized health insurance plan offered by a spouse's employer or through a second job. It's simply a matter of fairness, and a step we need to take now. 
   The second bill that I introduce today is the ``Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999.'' This bill will provide clear rules and relief for entrepreneurs seeking to be treated as independent contractors and for businesses needing to use independent contractors. As the Chairman of the Small Business Committee, I have heard from countless small business owners who are caught in the environment of fear and confusion that now surrounds the classification of workers. This situation is stifling the entrepreneurial spirit of many small business owners who find that they do not have the flexibility to conduct their businesses in a manner that makes the best economic sense and that serves their personal and family goals. 
   The root of this problem is found in the IRS' test for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Over the past three decades, the IRS has relied on a 20-factor test based on the common law to make this determination. On first blush, a 20-factor test sounds like a reasonable approach--if a taxpayer demonstrates a majority of the factors, he is an independent contractor. Not surprisingly, the IRS' test is not that simple. It is a complex set of extremely subjective criteria with no clear weight assigned to any of the factors. As a result, small business taxpayers are not able to predict which of the 20 factors will be most important to a particular IRS agent, and finding a certain number of these factors in any given case does not guarantee the outcome. 
   To make matters worse, the IRS' determination inevitably occurs two or three years after the parties have determined in good faith that they have an independent-contractor relationship. And the consequences can be devastating. The business recipient of the services is forced to reclassify the independent contractor as an employee and must pay the payroll taxes the IRS says should have been collected in the prior years. Interest and penalties are also piled on. The result for many small businesses is a tax bill that bankrupts the company. But that's not the end of the story. The IRS then goes after the service provider, who is now classified as an employee, and disallows a portion of her business expenses--again resulting in additional taxes, interest and penalties. 
   Mr. President, all of us in this body recognize that the IRS is charged with  the duty of collecting Federal revenues and enforcing the tax laws. The problem in this case is that the IRS is using a procedure that is patently unfair and subjective. And the result is that businesses must spend thousands of dollars on lawyers and accountants to try to satisfy the IRS' procedures, but with no certainty that the conclusions will be respected. That's no way for businesses to operate in today's rapidly changing economy. 
   For its part, the IRS has adopted a worker classification training manual, which according to the agency is an ``attempt to identify, simplify, and clarify the relevant facts that should be evaluated in order to accurately determine worker classification *.*.*.'' There can be no more compelling reason for immediate action on this issue. The IRS' training manual is more than 150 pages. If it takes that many pages to teach revenue agents how to ``simplify and clarify'' this small business tax issue, I think we can be sure how simple and clear it is going to seem to taxpayers who try to figure it out on their own. 
   The ``Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act'' is based on the provisions of my Home-Based Business Fairness Act, which I introduced at the start of the 105th Congress. My bill removes the need for so many pages of instruction on the 20-factor test by establishing clear rules for classifying workers based on objective criteria. Under these criteria, if there is a written agreement between the parties, and if an individual demonstrates economic independence and independence with respect to the workplace, he will be treated as an independent contractor rather than an employee. And the service recipient will not be treated as an employer. In addition, individuals who perform services through their own corporation or limited liability 
   company will also qualify as independent contractors as long as there is a written agreement and the individuals provide for their own benefits. 
   The safe harbor is simple, straightforward, and final. To take advantage of it, payments above $600 per year to an individual service provider must be reported to the IRS, just as is required under current law. This will help ensure that taxes properly due to the Treasury will continue to be collected. 
   Mr. President, the IRS contends that there are millions of independent contractors who should be classified as employees, which costs the Federal government billions of dollars a year. This assertion is plainly incorrect. Classification of a worker has no cost to the government. What costs the government are taxpayers who do not pay their taxes. My bill has three requirements that I believe will improve compliance among independent contractors using the new rules I propose. First, there must be a written agreement between the parties--this will put the independent contractor on notice at the beginning that he is responsible for his own tax payments. Second, the new rules will not apply if the service recipient does not comply with the reporting requirements and issue 1099s to individuals who perform services. Third, an independent contractor operating through his own corporation or limited liability company must file all required income and employment tax returns in order to be protected under the bill. 
   In the last Congress, concerns were raised that permitting individuals who provide their services through their own corporation or limited liability company to qualify as independent contractors would lead to abusive situations at the expense of workers who should be treated as employees. To prevent this option from being abused, I have added language that limits the number of former employees that a service recipient may engage as independent contractors under the incorporation option. This limit will protect against misuse of the incorporation option while still allowing individuals to start their own businesses and have a former employer as one of their initial clients. 
   Another major concern of many businesses and independent contractors is the issue of reclassification. My bill provides relief to these taxpayers when the IRS determines that a worker was misclassified. Under my bill, if the business and the independent contractor have a written agreement, if the applicable reporting requirements were met, and if there was a reasonable basis for the parties to believe that the worker is an independent contractor, then an IRS reclassification will only apply prospectively. This provision gives important peace of mind to small businesses that act in good faith by removing the unpredictable threat of retroactive reclassification and substantial interest and penalties. 
   A final provision of this legislation, Mr. President, is the repeal of section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. This section affects businesses that engage technical service providers, such as engineers, designers, drafters, computer programmers, and systems analysts. In certain 
   cases, Section 1706 precludes these businesses from applying the reclassification protections under section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. When section 1706 was enacted, its proponents argued that technical service workers were less compliant in paying their taxes. Later examination of this issue by the Treasury Department found that technical service workers are in fact more likely to pay their taxes than most other types of independent contractors. This revelation underscores the need to repeal section 1706 and level the playing field for individuals in these professions. 
   In the last two Congresses, proposals to repeal section 1706 enjoyed wide bipartisan support. The bill I introduce today is designed to level the playing field for individuals in these professions by providing the businesses that engage them with the same protections that businesses using other types of independent contractors have enjoyed for more than 20 years. 
   Mr. President, the bills I introduce today are common-sense measures that answer small business' urgent plea for fairness and simplicity in the tax law. As we work toward the day when the entire tax law is based on these principles, we can make a difference today by enacting these two bills. Entrepreneurs have waited too long--let's get the job done! 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD a copy of each bill and a description of its provisions.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999. I am pleased to announce that two of my colleagues from the Committee on Small Business, Senator KERRY and Senator LIEBERMAN, have joined as principal cosponsors. This is an important bill for one simple reason: it makes more investment capital available to small businesses that are seeking to grow and hire new employees. 
   In 1958, Congress created the SBIC Program to assist small business owners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although investment capital is readily available to large businesses from traditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking investments in the range of $500,000-$2.5 million have to look elsewhere. SBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital for growing small businesses. 
   In 1992 and 1996, the Committee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business Administration to correct earlier deficiencies in the law in order to ensure the future of the program. Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the growing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment capital. 
   Last year, the Committee on Small Business approved a bill similar to the bill being introduced today. Today's bill includes two technical changes in the SBIC program. The first change removes a requirement that at least 50 percent of the annual program level of the approved participating securities under the SBIC Program be reserved for funding with SBICs having private capital of not more than $20 million. The requirement has become obsolete following SBA's imposition of its leverage commitment process and Congressional approval for SBA to issue five year commitments for SBIC leverage. 
   The second technical change requires SBA to issue SBIC guarantees and trust certificates at periodic intervals of not less than 12 months. The current requirement is six months. This change will give maximum flexibility for SBA and the SBIC industry to negotiate the placement of certificates that fund leverage and obtain the lowest possible interest rate. 
   The Small Business Investment Improvement Act of 1999 clarifies the rules for the determination of an eligible small business or small enterprise that is not required to pay Federal income tax at the corporate level, but that is required to pass income through to its shareholders or partners by using a specified formula to compute its after-tax income. This provision is intended to permit ``pass through'' enterprises to be treated the same as enterprises that pay Federal taxes for purposes of SBA size standard determinations. 
   The bill would also make a relatively small change in the operation of the program. This change, however, would help smaller, small businesses to be more attractive to investors. SBICs would be permitted to accept royalty payments contingent on future performance from companies in which they invest as a form of equity return for their investment. 
   SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, which give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the equity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the small business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be payable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty feature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to attract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient to attract venture capital. 
   Lastly, the bill increases the program authorization levels to fund Participating Securities. In Fiscal Year 1999, the authorization level would increase from $800 million to $1.2 billion; in Fiscal Year 2000, it would increase from $900 million to $1.5 billion. The two increases have become necessary as the demand in the SBIC program was growing at a rapid rate. Higher authorization levels are necessary if the SBIC Program is going to meet the demand for investment capital from the small business community. 
   Mr. President, this is a sound legislative proposal, which has the support of many of my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business. It is my hope we will be able to conduct a committee markup of this bill in the near future.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today because this is a special day in our nation's history. On this day in 1944, Harry S. Truman, a proud Missourian and U.S. Senator at the time, authorized the christening of the U.S.S. Missouri. The Missouri is this country's last and most celebrated battleship. Senator Truman's 19-year old daughter, Margaret, christened this great battleship and sent the ``Mighty Mo'' and her crew on missions for our Armed Forces in World War II, the Korean War, and Operations Desert Storm--a time of service spanning nearly half a century. Today she begins a new era of service as a memorial to educate and remind new generations of Americans about the great sacrifices and even greater victories that have occurred during her military service. She is a symbol of American triumph and spirit as she majestically stands watch over the U.S.S. Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. 
   Today, in this unstable world, we should re-commit ourselves to honoring lasting symbols of unity and dedication. The 900-foot Battleship Missouri is one such symbol. This era of patriotism, sacrifice, bravery, and duty will not be forgotten, and in fact must be revered, remembered, and taught to our children and grandchildren. 
   For the United States, World War II began with a surprise attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. It finally ended on the decks of the ``Mighty Mo'' on September 2, 1945. On that day, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, and Chester Nimitz, Fleet Admiral of the U.S. Navy, signed the Instrument of Surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers and the United States. It is a moment that will now forever be immortalized to America and citizens of the world. 
   Most importantly, we need to remember that the ``Mighty Mo'' would not have played such an important role without the brave and true service of America's servicemen and their families. These men risked their lives at great personal sacrifice, all in the name of our country. They are the backbone of the great history of the U.S.S. Missouri. Many of these veterans are form the State of Missouri, including Seaman John C. Truman, the nephew of our 33rd president. 
   Today, January 29, 1999, is yet another significant day in the service of the U.S.S. Missouri--for today she opens permanently to the public as the Battleship Missouri Memorial. I urge all Missourians and all Americans to go see this great ship and experience her glorious history firsthand. I thank the U.S. Navy and the U.S.S. Missouri Memorial Association for creating such a special memorial for the world to enjoy for generations to come. 
   Congratulations to all involved for getting this memorial up and running. Congratulations to my friend Senator DANIEL INOUYE, who has been personally involved in this project. Finally, congratulations to the U.S. Navy, the people of Hawaii, the people of Missouri, and all Americans who now have the opportunity to visit and experience a crucial part of our great state's heritage.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as you know, this year the Miss USA Pageant will be held in my home state of Missouri this Friday. I rise today to recognize the hard work and dedication of the nearly 400 volunteers from Branson, Missouri who have donated multiple hours to ensure that this year's pageant runs smoothly. 
   The volunteer corps is an integral part of the pageant. They operate the entire pageant as well as all of the events leading up to it. It is the tireless effort and the many behind the scenes hours of the volunteers that make this pageant successful year after year. This year will be no different, as the people of Branson have done a wonderful job. 
   This Friday night, as millions of people across the country and around the world look to Branson for the crowning of the next Miss USA, I encourage all Americans to recognize the effort of the citizens of Branson who won't appear on camera and whose names won't scroll across the screen. Mr. President, I now ask the Senate to join me in recognition of these unsung heroes of the Miss USA Pageant.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Mildred Jamison for her hard work and dedication at The Faith House in North St. Louis, Missouri. The Faith House is a Child Caring/Placement Agency that is committed to helping children with special needs. Children that have been served by the Faith House include those that have been drug exposed, have HIV/AIDS, have been emotionally or sexually abused, are medically fragile (including transplant recipients and burn victims), physically and mentally challenged children, and those that are developmentally delayed. In the six years that The Faith House has contributed to the community, over 500 young lives have been changed by Ms. Jamison's vision. 
   I commend Ms. Jamison for her hard work and tireless dedication. I encourage communities across the nation to look to The Faith House as a model and inspiration for similar programs. It is my sincere hope that Ms. Jamison will continue to change young lives and enrich the community of North St. Louis for many years to come.

    Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act along with my colleagues Senators BENNETT, SNOWE, DODD, KERRY, and MOYNIHAN. This bill provides small businesses with the resources necessary to repair Year 2000 computer problems. Last year I introduced a similar bill that the Committee on Small Business adopted by an 18-0 vote and that the full Senate approved by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives did not act on the legislation prior to adjournment. I am reintroducing this bill because the consequences of Congress not taking action to assist small business with their Y2K problems are too severe to ignore. 
   Given the effects a substantial number of small business failures will have on our nation's economy, it is imperative that Congress promptly pass legislation that ensures that small businesses are aware of the Y2K problem and have access to capital to fix such problems. Moreover, it is imperative that Congress pass such legislation before the problem occurs, not after it has already happened. It is, therefore, with a sense of urgency that I am introducing the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. 
   The problem is that certain computers and processors in automated systems will fail because such systems will not recognize the Year 2000. In fact, a small business is at risk if it uses any computers in its business, if it has customized software, if it is conducting e-commerce, if it accepts credit card payments, if it uses a service bureau for its payroll, if it depends on a data bank for information, if it has automated equipment for communicating with its sales or service force or if it has automated manufacturing equipment. 
   Last June, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held hearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. The outlook is not good--in fact it is poor at best. The Committee received testimony that the entities most at risk from Y2K failures are small and medium-sized companies, not larger companies. The major reason for this anomaly is that many small companies have not begun to realize how much of a problem Y2K failure will be, and many may not have the access to capital to cure such problems before they cause disastrous results. 
   A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated 4.75 million small employers are subject to the Y2K problem. This equals approximately 82 percent of all small businesses that have at least two employees. The Committee has also received information indicating that approximately 750,000 small businesses may either shut down due to the Y2K problem or be severely crippled if they do not take action to cure their Y2K problems. Such failures will affect not only the employees and owners or failed small businesses, but also their creditors, suppliers and customers. Lenders will face significant losses if their small business borrowers either go out of business or have a sustained period in which they cannot operate. Most importantly, however, is the fact that up to 7.5 million families may face the loss of paychecks for a sustained period of time if small businesses do not remedy their Y2K problems. Given these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe economic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant in time and there are only 11 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on. 
   A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by the Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer in Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business depends on trailing technology purchased over the years, including 386 computers running custom software. Mr. Davis uses his equipment to run his entire business, including handling the company's payroll, inventory control, and maintenance of large databases on his customers and their specific needs. In addition, Golden Fields has a web site and sells the farm equipment it manufacturers over the internet. 
   Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Davis is aware of the Y2K problem and tested his equipment to see if it could handle the Year 2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment and software could not process the year 2000 date and would not work properly after December 31, 1999. That is when Mr. Davis's problem began. Golden Fields had to purchase an upgraded software package. That cost $16,000. Of course, the upgraded software would not run on 386 computers, so Golden Fields had to upgrade to new hardware. Golden Fields had a computer on each of its 11 employees' desks, so that each employee could access the program that essentially ran the company and assist filling the internet orders the company received. Replacing all the hardware would have cost Golden Fields $55,000. Therefore, Golden Fields needed to expend $71,000 just to put itself in the same position it was in before the Y2K problem. 
   Like many small business owners facing a large expenditure, Mr. Davis went to his bank to obtain a loan to pay for the necessary upgrades. Because Golden Fields was not already Y2K compliant, his bank refused him a loan because it had rated his company's existing loans as ``high-risk''. Golden Fields 
   was clearly caught in a Catch-22 situation. Nevertheless, Mr. Davis scrambled to save his company. He decided to lease the new hardware instead of purchasing it, but he will pay a price that ultimately will be more expensive than conventional financing. Moreover, instead of replacing 11 computers, Golden Fields only replaced six at a cost of approximately $23,000. Golden Fields will be less efficient as a result. The experience of Mr. Davis and Golden Fields has been and will continue to be repeated across the country as small businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will have on their business. 
   A recent survey conducted by Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Group on behalf of National Small Business United indicates that, like Golden Fields, many small businesses will incur significant costs to become Y2K compliant and are very concerned about it. The survey found that to become Y2K compliant, 29 percent of small- to medium-sized businesses will purchase additional hardware, 24 percent will replace existing hardware and 17 percent will need to convert their entire computer system. When then asked their most difficult challenge relating to their information technology, more than 54% of the businesses surveyed cited ``affording the cost.'' Congress must ensure that these businesses do not have the same trouble obtaining financing for their Y2K corrections as Mr. Davis and Golden Fields Agricultural Technologies. Moreover, Congress must deal with the concerns that have recently been raised that there may be a ``credit crunch'' this year with businesses, especially small businesses, unable to obtain financing for any purposes if they are not Y2K compliant. 
   In addition to the costs involved, there is abundant evidence that small  businesses are, to date, generally unprepared for, and in certain circumstances, unaware of the Y2K problem. The NFIB's most recent survey indicates that 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on taking action or do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry about. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act that I am introducing today will serve the dual purpose of providing small businesses with the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000, and making lenders and small firms more aware of the dangers that lie ahead. The Act requires the Small Business Administration to establish a limited-term loan program whereby SBA guarantees the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to assist small businesses in correcting Year 2000 computer problems. 
   Each lender that participates in the SBA's 7(a) business loan program is eligible to participate in the Y2K loan program. This includes more than 6,000 lenders located across the country. To ensure that the SBA can roll out the loan program promptly, the Act permits a lender to process Y2K loans pursuant to any of the procedures that the SBA has already authorized for that lender. Moreover, to assist small businesses that may have difficulty sustaining sufficient cash flows while developing Y2K solutions, the loan program will permit flexible financing terms so small businesses are able to service the new debt with available cash flow. For example, under certain circumstances, a borrower may defer principal payments for up to a year. Once the Y2K problem is behind us, the Act provides that the loan program will sunset. 
   To assure that the loan program is made available to those small businesses that need it and to increase awareness of the Y2K problem, the legislation requires SBA to market this program aggressively to all eligible lenders. Awareness of this loan program's availability is of paramount importance. Financial institutions are currently required by Federal banking regulators to contact their customers to ensure that they are Y2K compliant. The existence of a loan program designed to finance Y2K corrections will give financial institutions a specific solution to offer small companies that may not be eligible for additional private capital and will focus the attention of financial institutions and, in turn, their small business customers to the Y2K problem. 
   This loan program is of vital importance and we must ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay for it. Because the Y2K loan program would be part of the existing 7(a) business loan program, funds that have already been appropriated for the 7(a) program for fiscal year 1999 may be used for the Y2K loan program. Nevertheless, I intend to watch the 7(a) loan program carefully to determine whether the Y2K loan program will cause the 7(a) loan program to run short of funds. If the appropriated amount will not support the expected loan volume of the general 7(a) loan program and the new Y2K loan program, I intend to work with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to attempt to secure additional funds targeted specifically for the Y2K loan program. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to ensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a substantial number of small business failures following January 1, 2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing segment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond.

   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we start this 106th Congress, I think it is clear that education is going to be one of the top priorities we will address in this session of Congress. We are going to be working on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and I believe all of us, on both sides, are saying that this is a national priority. 
   As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator JOHN KERRY, said in a speech that he made at Northeastern University, ``Ever since there has been a United States of America, there have been public schools. And there has been a constant debate about how to make them work.'' I know that since I was elected to the United States Senate 12 years ago I have listened and participated in the many debates on public education that have occurred in this institution. I have even had some ideas of my own on how to improve education--some of which have been passed by this body and signed into law. 
   My intentions, like those of my Senate colleagues--have been good intentions. We all share the same goal of providing our children with a great education. We have been trying to do the right thing. 
   Today, however, our good intentions have mushroomed into burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have empowered the federal government and bureaucrats. We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have once again established a system where supposedly the Olympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley. 
   Mr. President, let me give you some examples of what our good intentions have gotten us. 
   We have 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different federal agencies. Vice President GORE's National Performance Review said that the Department of Education's discretionary grant process lasts 26 weeks and takes 487 steps from start to finish. The General Accounting Office has estimated that there are nearly 13,400 full-time jobs in the 50 states funded by the Department of Education with an additional 4,600 direct Department of Education employees. 
   We have teachers being taken off the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, taking on after school student activities, etc. and instead are researching for grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, filling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, and reporting on how they spend the federal money received. Or we have teachers and administrators deciding that the extra federal money is not worth the time and effort that it will take to get and comply with that they do not even bother to go through the process. 
   Most of us are now aware of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, that ranked American senior high school students 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math, and 16th out of the same 21 countries in science. In addition, 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders do not read at even a basic level. Colleges across this country are spending over $1 billion a year in remedial education. 
   Is this acceptable? Are we satisfied with the status quo? The answer should be--must be--an unequivocal NO. 
   In our business we pay a lot of attention to polls. For several years, the polls across the country have been telling us that we have a problem with public education. This is not new news and the question remains the same: How do we fix public education? 
   Mr. President, before I provide my answer to that question I want to take this opportunity to read from an editorial from a home-state newspaper, the Southeast Missourian.  
   Nearly a decade ago, then-President Bush and the nation's governors set a series of goals for America's schoolchildren in reading, math, graduation rates and other measures. But the national education goals panel says the nation's public schools will fall short of the goals for 2000. 
   We can only hope these continued failures to improve education will result in a overthrow of the so-called experts. These are the people, usually far removed from the classroom, who embrace quick fixes and fads in the face of each hand-wringing report. 
   Unfortunately, the fixes make the problems worse. What's needed is to return America's schools back to the basics and back to local teachers, administrators, school boards, and parents. Without a foundation in the basics, the rest of education just won't take. 
   We must take so-called remedies out of the hands of the federal government. National mandates are meaningless for America's schools. The problem must be addressed one district and one school at a time. Why not let classroom teachers--instead of bureaucrats and politicians--fashion a plan to improve learning in the classroom? Give more control to the local districts in building reading retention, math skills and graduation rates?  
   Mr. President, the editorial goes on, but it ends with the following:  
   The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual school boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the red tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who know best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public education.  
   I agree with the Southeast Missourian. The answer to improving public education does not lie within the halls of Congress or in the granite buildings of the downtown Washington education establishment. As the editorial stated, we are ``far removed from the classroom.'' 
   In my opinion, the real solutions--the laboratories--are local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not play the ``Mother, May I?'' game with Washington. 
   Here in Congress we must not be afraid to propose change. But in proposing change we must go directly to those who can provide some answers--the teachers, principals, school administrators, school board members, and parents. 
   For the past couple of years, I have done just that and have developed in conjunction with them the ``Direct Check for Education Act. 
   Quite simply, the purpose of this bill is to consolidate six, primarily competitive grant programs of the Department of Education's programs. The programs are Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program. The bill then proposes to return the federal funding by issuing a ``Direct Check'' to the local school district based on the number of students in each district. The result would be a resource of flexible funding that would allow individual schools and parents to determine how best to use the funds, including the hiring of new teachers, additional classrooms, new textbooks, expanded technology initiatives, drug and alcohol prevention programs, etc. The list goes on and on. 
   My ``Direct Check'' proposal is not the ``save-all'' answer. But the ``Direct Check'' will reduce the costly and time-consuming paperwork process that local school districts endure in obtaining federal grants and funding. It will treat children and schools the same by awarding funding to schools based upon the students served instead of rewarding some and penalizing others. My ``Direct Check for Education'' is a first step in simplifying and going ``back to the basics'' of education. 
   Mr. President, there will be those in the Washington education establishment who will oppose this bill. Instead  of finding ways to empower those at the local level the opposition will argue that we need even more federal programs, more bureaucracy, more micro management of the classroom. 
   I believe the bottom line is this: Education, while a national priority, is a local responsibility. We must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, school boards, etc. because education decisions can best be made by people at the local schools who know the names and the challenges facing the students in those schools. 
   Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold and let local school districts do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement. 
   We have burdened it with excessive regulations and red tape. We have once again established a system where supposedly the ``olympians'' on the Hill know what is best for the ``peasants'' in the valley. 
   I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Education is and must be a national priority. But the good intentions that we have had in this body have led to the creation of more than 760 Federal education programs. Has that made education better? I don't think so. We added three more last year. And now we gather that the President is going to come up with a grand new Federal scheme. How many people really believe that the 764th Federal education program is going to assure that our kids can read? Is it going to assure that we get our high school students out of the 19th place out of 21 in terms of mathematics? I don't believe so. 
   Our system is not working. If you want to know how well it is working, go back home. Ask the teachers in your local school district. Ask the principals in your local school district. Ask the parents at home. Ask the school board members. If you do that, I believe you will hear what I have heard, time and time again: They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government. They are tired of spending the time to fill out the forms for the grants, to comply and jump through the hoops that the Federal Government sets out for them, to write the reports and fill out the evaluation forms that are needed, only to have a competitive grant program run out at the end of 3 years. They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government. 
   We have an opportunity to do something that I think is very significant. Instead of going down the road that is going to be proposed of another new Federal program, we ought to take the remedies out of the hands of the Federal Government. National mandates are meaningless for American schools. The problems must be addressed one school district, one school, at a time. Why not let classroom teachers, the parents, the administrators--instead of bureaucrats and politicians--make the decisions on how to improve the education in their school districts? Give more control back to local districts and let them build reading retention, math skills, and improve graduation rates. 
   Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill we call the direct check for education bill. It takes six of the major Federal competitive grant programs--Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, the Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program--and puts them into a pool. That pool is to be divided on the basis of the students--K through 12--on average daily attendance. And it is to be returned to those local school districts on the basis of the number of students they have. Very simple. Cut the Federal red tape. Let them use those education dollars. 
   It starts off with a $3.5-million authorization, because we want to allow schools that already have competitive grants of multiyear tenure to complete those grants. At the end it will rise to $5 billion. It should come out to about $100 per student in every school--and turn the job back to the local schools, the parents, the teachers, the school board members, the administrators. 
   There are those who oppose this approach. They argue that we need even more Federal control. But as I said at the beginning, while it is a national priority, education must be returned to the local school districts as a local responsibility, to empower the people who know the names of the kids, their problems, their challenges, and their opportunities, to make the decision. 
   Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold. Let's let local schools do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement. Ask your teachers, your principals, your superintendents, your school board members; and then I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation that Senator ASHCROFT and I are introducing today.
