   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join you in supporting the statements made by the Senator from Montana. As managers of the Commerce, Justice, State bill, you and I have the responsibility and expectation of providing agencies under our jurisdiction with congressional input and guidance. On an issue of this great importance--transferring the a-root server to ICANN--it is critical we carefully look at the implications a decision like this would have.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator COLLINS, for her kind remarks regarding this subcommittee's work on the FY '01 Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary appropriations bill. I recognize the importance of investing in advanced building technologies that can resist damage from hurricanes. As you know, South Carolina has experienced several costly and disastrous hurricanes. Yet our coastal economy continues to expand and to serve as a commercial and recreation resource to our State and the Nation. 
   I agree with my colleague that development of fiberglass-reinforced wood composites is important, and I also encourage the National Institute of Standards and Technology to support the development and deployment of these materials. Improvements to wood building materials will result in direct benefits to the people of South Carolina and all other coastal communities in the United States.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, those of us who have been around this town for a while know how much we and this government depend on our civil servants to get the really tough jobs done, to bring ideas to reality, and sometimes to even tell us when our ideas need some adjusting, shall we say. These people don't get much praise, at least not nearly enough. 
   One of the classic examples of a dedicated civil servant, Ray Kammer, is about to retire from government service after 31 years. Ray retires on December 29 as Director of the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he spent the vast majority of his career. I have known Ray for a good portion of that time, both from his work at NIST and from the time he spent at the Department's headquarters and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. 
   In the late 1980's, the country called upon NIST, which used to be known as the National Bureau of Standards, to help industry rally and regain its competitiveness. It was a time when we first began facing severe competition from overseas. The Bureau's labs had a long-standing reputation for excellence, impartiality, and for working cooperatively with industry. Ray helped us to expand that mission by establishing NIST and adding the Advanced Technology Program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and the Baldrige National Quality Program. It wasn't easy, but we got it done. Ten years later--with Ray's help--those programs have been tremendously beneficial for this country. 
   While at NOAA and during his time as Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration at the Commerce Department, Ray helped to stabilize several critical programs that needed the steady hand of an experienced manager. He was the Department's fireman of sorts, always being called on to help put out this fire, put out that fire, and to keep another one from breaking out. Even now, Ray is helping us take a look at how to improve NOAA's fisheries service. 
   I am sorry that we are losing Ray, especially at a time when NIST is just about to begin its centennial year and the agency will be getting a lot more attention and credit for all of the good work that its staff has done. I want to wish him my very best. I know that I am joined by others in this body who have had the pleasure of working with this dedicated public servant, Ray Kammer.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on H.R. 5461, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, legislation to begin, and I stress the word begin, to ensure the conservation of sharks, including addressing the causes and consequences of shark finning. 
   First, I want to recognize Ms. SNOW, our chairman on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, and Mr. KERRY, ranking member of the subcommittee, for putting shark conservation legislation on the committee agenda this Congress. My colleagues recognized the substantial danger international fleets pose to sharks around the world, either as a result of direct harvest, high bycatch, or practices such as shark finning. As with so many of our highly migratory and protected species, we cannot hope to address these threats solely through domestic action. 
   We are here today because of the growing threats to shark populations, which are particularly vulnerable to harvest and bycatch mortality. Most attention has been focused specifically on the practice of shark finning, which has increased dramatically over the past decade, driven by rising demand for fins in the world market. However, there are other threats to shark conservation, including directed shark fisheries and the use of non-selective fishing gear, that must be given further attention, both here and abroad. In addition, the amount of finning done by U.S. fishermen pales by comparison to the amount of finning done by foreign fleets outside of U.S. waters. The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around the world. In 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service estimated that 120 metric tons of shark fins were landed in Hawaii that had been caught by foreign vessels, with a value between $2,376,000 and $2,640,000. That is roughly four times the amount landed by U.S. vessels in the same year. These figures include only figures for shark fins that happen to go through U.S. ports in the Pacific; the total amount of finning by foreign fishermen is undoubtedly much higher. 
   Although I support the legislation before us today, I am disappointed that we were not able to convince House Members and others that passage of S. 2831, the Shark Conservation Act of 2000, introduced by Senator KERRY, and supported by our subcommittee members, was the best course of action to take this year. S. 2831 attempted to address threats to shark conservation in a holistic manner. It looked beyond domestic finning, and provided the administration with tools to address finning by foreign nations as well. As a result, the current bill does not contain the strong international enforcement measures of the Shark Conservation Act. Dr. Andrew Rosenberg of the National Marine Fisheries Service, in October 1999 
   testimony before the House warned of the consequences of failing to impose international measures against shark finning:  
   ..... even with implementation of new U.S. management measures to prohibit shark finning, in all likelihood, foreign-flagged vessels will continue shark finning in international waters. In the absence of strict international measures to prohibit shark finning, the anticipated result of new U.S. prohibitions would be that foreign vessels will develop new shipment routes for shark fins through ports outside Hawaii.  
   The administration's warning should be taken seriously. When all the press releases and headlines have faded from memory, there is no doubt that foreign fleets will silently, and happily, continue--or even increase--shark finning, with no adverse repercussions to speak of. We sincerely hope that H.R. 5461 will not merely shift shark-finning and the resulting profits over to foreign nations and international corporations, with no net benefit to shark conservation. The only way to prevent this is by applying these rules to everyone. Simply enacting H.R. 5461 without addressing shark conservation internationally is short-sighted and will not solve the problem. In the next Congress, I intend to continue working with my colleagues in the Senate, House, and the new administration, whichever administration that may turn out to be, to craft a solution that will lead to the eventual cessation of finning internationally. 
   Although I do believe that the current bill is not as strong as it should be, I am glad to report it contains a number of provisions from the Senate bill that will lay the foundation for addressing the international fishing practices that threaten shark conservation efforts, including the practice of finning. H.R. 5461 begins the critical process of collecting the information, including data on the international shark fin trade, that is so lacking at the present time by: (1) directing the administration to initiate or continue discussions with other countries to ban shark finning; (2) requiring the collection of information on trade in shark fins and directing the Secretary to report the findings to Congress; and (3) establishing a research program to help improve shark stock assessments, reduce incidental catch, and better utilize sharks captured legally. 
   Let me conclude by stating that I rise in support of this legislation and urge its adoption, but I cannot help but think of what we may have been able to accomplish with passage of Mr. KERRY's bill, S. 2831. H.R. 5461 does take an important first step to end the practice of finning, but it is only the first step--the real work is yet to come.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, It has come to my attention that a young man, Todd Porterfield, was struck by a car and killed over the summer while he was participating in a philanthropy event for Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity, of which I am an alumnus. Todd, a senior at the University of Washington, was on a cross-country bike ride called the Journey of Hope. Each year, the Journey of Hope raises approximately $300,000 for the national organization Push America that supports people with disabilities. Todd's commitment to service was remarkable in someone so young. He not only helped lead philanthropy efforts within his fraternity, but also traveled to Mexico to build homes for the disadvantaged and volunteered for three different shelters and outreach programs for the homeless in Seattle. Todd had a bright future and no doubt would have continued to be an active and caring member of his community. My thoughts are with his friends and family, members of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and the University of Washington.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Senator THURMOND on his 98th birthday. Few people are lucky enough to reach this milestone in their lives, but fewer still, if any, can claim a life as rich and colorful as STROM THURMOND's. He is what the lawyers call ``sui generis''--one of a kind, unique. Last year, a monument to Senator THURMOND was dedicated on the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse. It was a deserving tribute, but hardly necessary to mark his many contributions to our State and Nation. He is, after all, a living political icon. Generations of South Carolinians refer to him affectionately as ``STROM'' and his birthday is a celebration of service to our State. I know the people of South Carolina join me and Peatsy in sending Senator THURMOND our best wishes for a wonderful day.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize South Carolina's Thelma Frazier Rivers who will celebrate her 115th birthday on Nov. 3. Mrs. Rivers was born in Darlington County in 1885 and now lives in nearby Timmonsville in Florence County. She and her late husband, Horace, had 22 children and many of them, as well as plenty of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, will help her celebrate this remarkable occasion. Throughout her life, Mrs. Rivers has enjoyed working in her yard and serving at her church, Bethlehem Baptist, in Timmonsville. She was blessed with a beautiful singing voice which she has passed down to her children and grandchildren. She also has a flair for any kind of handiwork, including quilting, and she still enjoys sewing. ``Everyone in Timmonsville knows Thelma,'' one of her daughters explained, and rightly so; Mrs. Thelma Rivers is truly a treasure. My wife, Peatsy, and I wish her continued health and happiness and the most joyful of birthdays.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr President, I rise today to remember one of South Carolina's finest doctors, Michael E. Assey, who passed away on October 28. A graduate of Georgetown University's School of Medicine, Michael joined the staff of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in 1979 and rose to the position of Professor of Medicine, Chief of Cardiology. In 1998, he was named to the ``Best Doctors in America'' list. He served as governor of the American College of Cardiology and as president of the S.C. affiliate of the American Heart Association. Michael also authored numerous medical articles and medical textbook chapters. While at MUSC, he received the prestigious Golden Apple Award for excellence in teaching. The President of MUSC, Raymond Greenberg, said, ``his professional legacy lies in the generation of young doctors who, as Michael Assey's students, not only learned clinical skills, but compassion and commitment.'' With Michael's passing, the Medical University has lost a great doctor and great teacher and South Carolina has lost a great man. My wife, Peatsy and I send our thoughts and prayers to Michael's devoted wife, Valerie, and their two children.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I would like to take a moment and join my subcommittee chairman and colleague, Senator GREGG, in commenting on the fiscal year 2001 Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and related agencies appropriations portion of the conference report before the Senate today. Once, again, I would like to commend Chairman GREGG for his outstanding efforts and bipartisan approach in bring an appropriations bill to the floor that is good and balanced. 
   Putting together the conference report is always a tremendous challenge, and this year has proven to be no different. We face the challenge of adequately funding a host of varying missions, This bill funds efforts to fight crime and drugs on our streets. This bill funds initiatives that enhance business opportunities for small and large companies at home and abroad. This bill funds agencies like the FTC and the SEC that protect consumers from fraud. This bill provides funding for scientific research needed for better fisheries management. This bill provides free and accurate weather forecasting to farmers who rely on it day by day for tending their crops and to families who live in areas where timely and accurate forecasts can save their lives from violent tornadoes, torrential rains, floods, and hurricanes. While the missions funded through this bill may vary, one point remains constant: The funding provided in this bill seeks to improve the daily lives and safety of all American at home and abroad. 
   In total, the conference report provides $38.0 billion in budget authority which is about $1.7 billion less in total budget authority than the fiscal year 2000 levels. The bill is $12.9 billion less than the President's request level; however, his request level, as in past years, included advanced appropriations, which the CJS Subcommittee traditionally does not provide. 
   Senator GREGG has mentioned many of the funding specifics in this bill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point out to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill:

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Broadwave affiliates of Northpoint Technology proposes to share the spectrum currently being used by the Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency bands. Through the use of its technology in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, Northpoint has the potential to provide much needed competition to cable by offering low cost multichannel video services and high-speed Internet access. 
   A provision, however, addressing sharing issues in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band has been added to the ``Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000'' (also referred to as the Rural Loan Guarantee bill). Section 12 of this Act imposes three general requirements. First, it requires that a terrestrial wireless applicant proposing to use the 12.2-12.7 GHz band have its technology subjected to an independent demonstration or have its technical showings subjected to an independent analysis to determine whether the technology will cause harmful interference to DBS operators. Second, the Federal Communications Commission is required to select an independent engineering firm recommended by the IEEE or other similar body to analyze the technologies proposed in the pending wireless terrestrial applications. Third, the demonstration or analysis must be concluded within 60 days of enactment of the Rural Loan Guarantee bill and the comment cycle cannot exceed an additional 30 days. Lastly, I want to note that enactment of this provision by Congress does not release the FCC from its obligations under section 2002 of SHIVA. 
   In my home state of South Carolina, there are Broadwave affiliates awaiting regulatory approval so that they can begin to provide service. Therefore, I expect that the testing required under the Rural Loan Guarantee legislation will constitute the final interference analysis needed to evaluate sharing requirements between terrestrial applicants with pending applications and existing DBS service providers. Moving this proceeding forward is important, because if Northpoint is able to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations, it will not only be able to provide competition to cable, but through its affiliate structure, it also will afford small businesses an opportunity to participate in a vibrant segment of the communications marketplace.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office recently concluded that formal software management policies at eight of the sixteen U.S. Federal agencies they investigated were found to be inadequate and that controls over access to software codes were weak. I am convinced that the information systems used by the Department of Defense are critical components of the warfighting capability of the United States. Off-the-shelf and customized software is critical to the functioning of these systems. I rise today to express my concern that the security and integrity of critical government systems could be at great risk if their operational software has been procured or developed outside the United States or without proper oversight and control. I have read, with growing concern, a number of news articles that suggest that foreign software acquisitions can have potentially catastrophic consequences on both classified and unclassified national information management systems used by Federal agencies for sensitive applications. 
   I would like to cite just few examples to illustrate my point. An article in the February 16, 2000, Washington Post discussed the State Department's purchase of an unclassified, but sensitive, business operations system with software code developed by former citizens of the Soviet Union. According to the article, State withdrew the system from their embassies worldwide because they were concerned that hidden code might have been added during development and fielding. The final paragraph of the article states: ``The lesson of State's fiasco is simple--but so important it should be hard-wired: As people and organizations grow more dependent on computers, they become more vulnerable. It's easy to forget that every line of code can be a potential spy or saboteur.'' 
   On March 2, 2000, the New York Times reported that Japanese software suppliers associated with the terrorist sect responsible for the Tokyo subway nerve gas attack had sold software programs to several Japanese government agencies, to include their Defense Ministry. According to the article, the agencies and companies that ordered the software were unaware that the sect was involved because the principal suppliers had sub-contracted the work to others. As recently as June 19, 2000, the Defense News reported that two German defense industry employees were convicted of selling missile secrets to Russia. A software provider could have easily employed these ``spies.'' Unfortunately, this is not a new phenomenon. On October 24, 1999, as we prepared for the Y2K transition, the Los Angeles Times ran an article citing concerns by security experts that the use of foreign contractors for Y2K solutions could have placed critical systems at risk. The article reports that, in the words of one government security expert, ``The use of untested foreign sources for Y2K remediation has created a unique opportunity for foreign countries or companies to access and disrupt sensitive national security and proprietary information systems.'' The GAO further maintained that background screening policies for personnel involved in Y2K remediation were lacking or inadequate despite at least 85 Federal contracts being completed using foreign nationals. 
   The Department of Defense routinely purchases software developed by foreign companies. The Department is often unaware of that fact. For many of its unclassified, but critically important, business operating systems, government agencies contract with a systems integrator. The integrator then selects the software system to be installed as part of the operating system. The Agencies are often not aware that the software was developed in a foreign country, by foreign developers, and perhaps, even in a foreign language. I believe that, at a minimum, the provision of software produced by a U.S. company (or at least software controlled by a U.S. company) should be a consideration in the acquisition process. Encouraging the Defense Department (and other Government agencies) to at least consider the origin and ownership of source codes will not eliminate vulnerability, but it is a step in the right direction. Additionally, it reinforces software development as a key component of our defense industrial base. For that reason, I urge the Administration to put in place protocols in the selection process that consider the origin of all source codes used in the development of information systems acquired or developed. This should include those acquisitions arranged via sub-contracts by prime contractors or system integrators.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me say that no one has really performed more distinguished service than our colleague from Nevada, RICHARD BRYAN. I have seen them all now over my 34 years. Senator BRYAN has judgment. It comes from his hard experience as a State's Governor, and it comes from a tremendous sense of history. I have always been impressed with his fascinating knowledge of historical facts, and he brings history into focus in regard to present-day realities. We are going to miss that. We are going to miss that here in the Senate. We are going to miss his charming wife Bonnie. We have worked with both of them, traveled with both of them, and they have made a magnificent contribution to the future of this country. 
   I have said time and again that, more than a balanced budget, what we need is balanced Senators, balanced Congressmen. If anyone is one who is really balanced in his approach to the needs of the Nation and the way we go about doing our business here in the Senate, it is RICHARD BRYAN of Nevada. I didn't realize that was what we were going to have here this morning, but I jump at the chance to say something about a distinguished Senator such as Senator BRYAN.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am going to go into my frustration that, I take it, is well known. I am back almost like George Wallace some 30 years ago when he said there wasn't a dime's worth of difference. Both Republicans and Democrats pass these trade bills on the premise that they are going to create jobs in America, when the truth of the matter is they are going to create jobs outside of America. We are going to transfer the fine, good manufacturing jobs from the United States--more or less the middle class of the country--to countries offshore and to Mexico and the Caribbean. Otherwise, we constantly talk of saving Social Security--both Republicans and Democrats--when the truth of the matter is we are squandering Social Security.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows that last year--the year 2000--we owed Social Security some $l.009 trillion. That is a significant figure. The year before that--1999--we owed $855 billion. But you can see it is jumping in increments of $150 billion. 
   These are the trust funds that we are borrowing from when they talk about surplus, because both Republicans and Democrats are talking about the surplus. Governor Bush and Vice President GORE are out on the campaign trail talking about how we are going to spend the money.

   I promised the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, that I would jump off the Capitol dome if the so-called Balanced Budget Act balanced the budget by this year. I came close to having to buy a parachute and getting ready to jump. I really did. 
   There was an inordinate collection of revenues, including personal income taxes and corporate returns throughout the year. I was extremely worried and was going to have to face up to the truth to my good friend, the distinguished chairman of our Budget Committee. But I was saved by the bell with the reality that we never had a surplus. 
   There is no better document than this one. The Treasury news ``For Immediate Release'' of October 24 entitled ``Joint Statements of Lawrence H. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jacob J. Lew, Director of the Office of Management and Budget on budget results for the fiscal year 2000.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as you can see, during 1968-1969, when President Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, we had at that particular time a $2.9 billion surplus. We have been running deficits ever since. 
   I heard the litany in the debates why we had not done anything. 
   When this Congress started 8 years ago, as the RECORD shows, in 1992, there was a deficit of $403.6 billion. We were spending $403.6 more than we were taking in. 
   Under the 1993 provisions, whereby we not only cut spending but we increased taxes, including the tax on Social Security and the tax on gasoline. We reduced the Federal workforce by 300,000 employees. That got us on the road to reducing the deficit from $403.6 billion to $22.9 billion. But the debt has continued to increase, and there is no surplus. That is the point I am trying to make. 
   Only on last evening, in trying to renegotiate the State-Justice-Commerce bill--I don't know whether it will be included--but they wanted the statement that $240 billion shall be used to pay down the debt. Absolutely false. They transfer the debt to these trust funds that I have already listed in the RECORD with respect to Social Security, Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment compensation, and on down the list. They are really transferring. They are not paying down anything. There is no surplus. We have increased the debt. 
   The reality is that we have just created the biggest waste in the history of government. 
   I served on the Grace Commission against waste, fraud, and abuse. We worked very diligently and carried out about 85 percent of the recommendations of the Commission. In spite of our efforts, however, under President Reagan's so-called ``voodoo'' economics, the debt increased. We kept going, first under President Reagan, with a $1 trillion debt, and then a second trillion dollars, a third trillion dollars, a fourth trillion, a fifth trillion, and now the debt has grown to $5.7 trillion. 
   Along with that is the interest cost. Under President Johnson, when we balanced that budget, it was $16 billion. That is 200 years of history including the cost of all the wars, from the Revolutionary War, World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam. It has gone from $16 billion up to $362 billion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you can see the interest cost of $361,997,734,302.36, and on down the list. 
   At $1 billion a day--I will never forget the comments made by the distinguished majority leader at the time President Clinton was making his address to the joint session of Congress at the beginning of the year. He said that gentleman is costing us $1 billion a minute. The President talked for 90 minutes. Governor Bush wants to cut taxes some $90 billion. So the two of them--the Bush program and the Clinton program--are $180 billion. We are spending $362 billion on interest costs alone. 
   That leaves $182 billion that you can use to increase research for cancer, increase defense--defense is stretched now--and everything else. 
   The point is we are spending a fortune on absolutely nothing. With the profligacy of these past Congresses, the lack of awareness of the American people, and the media's failure to deliver the truth to the American public, I wanted the record to be cleared. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the United States has over 2 million fires annually. Each one can devastate a family or business. I should know. Last year, I lost my home in Charleston, SC to fire. The statistics--approximately 4500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, more than $8 billion in direct property losses, and more than $50 billion in costs to taxpayers each year--do not tell the whole story. A fire can take away a lifetime of things that have true value only to the person who has suffered the loss. The tragic thing is that most of these fires are preventable. 
   H.R. 1550 would authorize appropriations for the United States Fire Administration for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Fire Administration provides invaluable services--such as training, data, arson assistance, and research for better safety equipment and clothing--to the more than 1.2 million paid and volunteer firefighters throughout the Nation. 
   The administration's FY 2001 budget request for the Fire Administration was $69 million, $25 million of which was for grants to local fire departments. S. 1941, the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act, authorizes $100 million in FY 2001 and $300 million in FY 2002 for these grants. That bill was ordered to be reported by the Commerce Committee on Spetember 20, 2000. Subsequently, the text of S. 1941, as reported, was included in the Department of Defense Authorization Act. Therefore, the substitute amendment to H.R. 1550 now under consideration does not include funding for grants to local fire departments within the Fire Administration's FY 2001 authorization. 
   The bill also provides additional funding for counterterrorism training, requires the Fire Administration to submit a strategic plan and a plan for research, and makes technical corrections to the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 and the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation Act. I support H.R. 1550 and urge its immediate passage.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on S. 1482, the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000, legislation to reauthorize the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. 
   To begin, I want to thank Senator SNOWE, our chairman on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for putting this legislation on the committee agenda this Congress and working diligently for its passage. In addition, passage of this bill would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. KERRY. I would also like to thank them for their support and inclusion of the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program in this bill. We were all deeply saddened by Dr. Foster's passing this year, at the height of her career as the head of the National Ocean Service. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we are only too pleased to have this opportunity to recognize Dr. Foster's efforts to protect, understand, and make the public care about our marine environment. Dr. Foster was particularly proud of NOAA's Sanctuaries Program and I know she would have appreciated creating this opportunity to encourage more women and minorities to become involved in the study of the marine environment and conservation of our underwater treasures. 
   When Congress enacted the National Marine Sanctuaries Act in 1972 we recognized that while the Nation had already provided our ``special areas'' on land with protections, we had no mechanism to protect those areas of the marine environment with unique qualities that are of special national, and even international, significance. Congress acted on the need for certain marine areas to be protected from human threats and recognized that management of undersea areas posed different challenges than land-based preserves, requiring different expertise and approaches. In fact, at the time, the unique character of the marine environment was the predominant reason for bringing together the Stratton Commission and the subsequent creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the Commission's recommendation. Before the creation of NOAA in 1970, the late Senator from Washington state, Warren Magnuson, noted that twenty-eight different departments and agencies dealt with the field of oceanography. Senator Magnuson concluded, in part because of the lack of coordination that we ``know more about the back side of the Moon that we know of three-quarters of the Earth's surface.'' The creation of NOAA was the way to go about changing this fact. Since then, Congress has consistently endorsed the creation of NOAA 30 years ago as the premier federal agency to manage, study, and protect the marine environment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. 
   In much the same way, Congress created the sanctuaries system to ``provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the conservation and management of special areas of the marine environment.'' It was the clear intent of Congress that a tool was needed to create and protect marine sanctuaries. If the Congress believed that existing laws could have done the job, we would not have created the Sanctuary program. In fact, in 1971 we recognized there was a need to create a marine sanctuaries program because ``a mechanism for protecting certain important areas of the coastal zone from intrusive activities by man ..... is not met by any legislation now on the books.'' 
   Furthermore, the Senate Commerce Committee found that ``the establishment of marine sanctuaries is appropriate where it is desirable to set aside areas of the seabed and the waters above for scientific study, to preserve, unique, rare, or characteristic features of the oceans, coastal, and other waters, and their total ecosystems.'' As I have said before, it is as clear now as it was then that NOAA is the appropriate  agency to study and preserve marine ecosystems; the line offices of NOAA have expertise in all of the major areas that impact marine sanctuaries and the ecosystems on which they depend. 
   Today, nothing has occurred that would change the intent of Congress when they created the sanctuaries program in 1972--certain areas of the marine environment need special protection and recognition. While that protection has not been as comprehensive as many would like, I know that the program is growing in both energy and focus thanks to a concerted effort from all those who care about our coastal environment. This year marks a great turning point for the program, as a result of the improvements in this legislation, the current five-year review process, the increased financial commitment by both the Congress and the administration, and the flood of public support for ocean conservation. In fact, the exploration and publicity generated by NOAA's Sustainable Seas program, in conjunction with the National Geographic Society, will help bring a fuller understanding and focus to each of our sanctuaries. 
   Now, one of the hallmarks of the Sanctuaries Act is the process that Congress established to ensure significant ``up-front'' involvement of all constituent groups affected by the designation of a sanctuary. Although to some this may seem unduly cumbersome, I believe that the history has shown that this inclusive, open-door process has worked and that the ``behind-closed doors, top-down'' approach creates nothing but havoc and leads to ineffective solutions that lack public support. However, I am heartened by the fact that President Clinton appears to agree with the process Congress created with the sanctuaries program. In Executive Order 13158 on Marine Protected Areas, signed on May 26, 2000, President Clinton states, ``In carrying out the requirements of ..... of this order, [agencies] shall consult with those States that contain portions of the marine environment, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, tribes, Regional Fishery Management Councils, and other entities, as appropriate, to promote coordination of Federal, State, territorial, and tribal actions to establish and manage MPAs.'' 
   I would urge the administration to continue meeting the commitment to involve the public, the states, and tribes as much as possible up front, particularly with respect to efforts currently underway within the administration to identify and protect the corals and other living marine resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Use the authorities and direction contained in the Sanctuaries Act; it is flexible, works well with our nearshore analogs, the National Estuarine Research Reserves, and other coastal reserves and parks, and has the added benefit of a well-known process that has worked to ensure lasting public support for protecting the marine environment. In this regard, I commend the cooperative efforts of NOAA, and other federal and state agencies, and all the constituent groups in putting together the Tortugas Ecological Reserve under able leadership of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. 
   NOAA was established 30 years ago to research, protect, and manage our nations oceans and atmosphere. That statement may seem fairly obvious, but there are some who may have lost sight of where we've come from and where we are going. So I thought I would re-state congressional intent for the record: Congress clearly intended that NOAA be the lead agency in development of a comprehensive and coordinated ocean and coastal management system, including marine protected areas, under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and many of the other statutes it implements such as the Coastal Zone Management Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. 
   In closing, I would like again state my support for the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act and to urge its adoption by the Senate. This bill takes an important step to further the wise stewardship of our marine resources and the protection of areas of significant ecological, aesthetic, historical and recreational value. It will improve our 13 existing sanctuaries, provide a rational framework for the designation of any future marine sanctuaries, and offers a sound mechanism for a coordinating a national system of marine protected areas.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with my colleague from the great State of Hawaii. The National Sanctuary Program is an ideal tool for coordinated and comprehensive management of the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI. I further agree that any closure areas imposed by the President prior to the completion of the sanctuary designation process should be subject to public comment and review before it becomes permanently carved in stone. Does the Senator envision that the Reserve area would be subject to the same 5-year program review that the Sanctuary process provides? In addition to Congressional oversight, such periodic and rigorous review will help ensure the Sanctuary and Reserve are meeting the expectations set by the people of Hawaii, the Sanctuary Advisory Council, the Secretary of Commerce, and the President.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1654 which authorizes appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 2000 to 2002. 
   We have taken a long road to reach this point. I particularly want to thank my fellow conferees, Senators MCCAIN, FRIST, STEVENS, and BREAUX. You and your staffs have worked in a professional, bipartisan manner to get this bill done. Congratulations. 
   In the past year alone, we have heard of great successes at NASA--launch of the first element of the International Space Station, discoveries about the nature of our universe by our new Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the discovery of evidence to show liquid water on Mars. However, NASA has also seen some chinks in its armor with the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander and subsequent questions about the ``faster, better, cheaper'' mission concept. I note that Section 301 of the bill requires an independent cost analysis of missions that are projected to cost more than $150 million so that we do not operate under unrealistic budget constraints that have been blamed, in part, for these losses. 
   It seems that NASA is at a bit of a crossroads both in trying to operate more efficiently without losing its effectiveness and in looking forward to the day when the International Space Station will be complete. So you see, this is the perfect time for an authorization bill like this one to help lay down a road map for the agency. 
   Specifically, H.R. 1654 authorizes $13.6 billion for NASA in FY 2000, $14.2 billion in FY 2001, and $14.6 billion in FY 2002. These are at or above the requested level. The conference report highlights some priorities within NASA's accounts. I want to make it very clear for the record, though--this is an authorization bill. None of this money in any of these accounts can be spent until appropriated. The VA-HUD appropriations law will have the final say on spending, and that is as it should be. 
   Senator MCCAIN and Senator BREAUX, I am sure, will summarize the major provisions of this legislation. I would like to discuss, briefly, why the conferees did what we did in a few places. 
   The bill imposes a cap on the total development cost of the International Space Station and related Space Shuttle launch costs. While I am no supporter of the International Space Station, I support the cap as a way of imposing a program that until recently was bleeding more and more red ink every day. 
   Nonetheless, I am concerned about the safety of the Shuttle, the Station, and our astronauts. As soon as NASA expressed concerns about safety, we immediately listened to their concerns and accommodated them without putting a hole in the cap that you could fly the Shuttle through. 
   Section 324 of the bill alters the provisions of the Space Act relating to insurance, indemnification, and cross waivers for experimental launch vehicles. Current law provides broad authority for the Administrator of NASA to indemnify the developers of experimental launch vehicles. As you may know, the parallel authority under FAA's licensing authority for operational vehicles sunsets periodically. H.R. 1654 places a sunset on the authority for experimental vehicles to allow us to review its use. The bill also does not allow reciprocal waivers of liability in a case where a loss results from the willful misconduct of a party to such waiver. 
   I am pleased we could include section 322 which would prohibit the licensing of the U.S. launch of a payload containing advertising which would be visible to the naked eye from space. It also encourages the President to seek agreements with other nations to do the same. I, for one, do not believe that advertisements should compete for space in the sky with constellations, meteor showers, and planets. 
   The conferees have authorized $25 million in FY 2001 and 2002 for the Commercial Remote Sensing Program's data purchases. I hope that such funding would be used to assist local and state government users acquire and use remote sensing data in their operations. 
   The conferees have worked with the Administration to resolve several complicated policy issues. We did not come to the exact place the Administration wanted us to be. Nonetheless, I think we have come to provisions which satisfy the Administration's bottom line. Does the Administration love the bill? Of course not--what agency likes oversight, likes an authorization bill, especially if that agency has been operating in the absence of authorization since FY 1993. Nonetheless, I think we have done a good job. This is a bill the President can and should sign. 
   We resolve the Administration's concerns regarding onerous provisions relating to Russian involvement in the Space Station program by making them country-neutral and forward-looking. The bill keeps the Space Station Commercial Demonstration Program in law, albeit for a shorter authorization period. H.R. 1654 will allow NASA to lease an inflatable habitation module or ``Trans-HAB.'' The bill does not terminate the Triana satellite program. And, as I mentioned before, the bill accounts for safety-related concerns about the cap provision. 
   Unfortunately, we could not include some meritorious provisions which were transmitted to the Hill with NASA's FY 2001 budget submission. I would be happy to work in the next Congress with NASA on a policy bill which meets these needs.  
   Finally, I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee once again. When our negotiations with the House threatened to dissolve, he stood firm on the need for a bipartisan NASA bill this year. I speak for all of the conferees when I congratulate him for putting together this bill. While it is not perfect, I support H.R. 1654 and hope that the Senate will adopt the conference report.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding South Carolina native, Michael Tecklenburg, who has been named president of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard  of Hearing. I have had the privilege of knowing Michael and his family in Charleston for many years and I can't think of an individual more deserving of this honor. 
   As a young child, Michael was initially diagnosed as being mentally disabled, but his parents recognized their son's abilities and did not give up until doctors discovered his true condition--deafness. Michael went on to excel in his studies at St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis and later at the University of South Carolina Honors College. In 1989, he became the first deaf graduate of Columbia Law School. 
   Since 1999, Michael has been the Washington, D.C. director of the South Carolina Governor's Office. Prior to joining the Governor's staff, Michael practiced law with the Washington firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand. He has also served as litigation counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-trust division and as assistant counsel in the Presidential Personnel Office. 
   At 37, Michael is the youngest person to serve as the Bell Association's president, a small fact that attests to his very large talent. I have no doubt that he will guide the Association to many successes during his two-year tenure. He is a credit to South Carolina and to the Nation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the committee has led the way on this tire safety measure on the Senate side. I just had an opportunity to look at the House provision. There is no question that there are two or three things in there that should be cleared up. One, it has certain reporting requirements, but then the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is supposed to keep them top secret. I want that explained to me. We do not operate like the CIA. There is no reason to keep it from public knowledge. In fact, that is exactly why we have this entity--to collect reported defects that come to the attention of the consumers in America. 
   Secondly, there is another provision with respect to criminal penalties. I have tire manufacturers in my State, and I wanted to be absolutely clear that we did not unduly threaten fine, good businessmen who are working to produce a safe product. Or make it so that they would be faced with some kind of criminal charge by way of a mistake that did not come to their knowledge. That was not the intent of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from South Carolina as we worked through this. 
   Obviously, that was taken out of the Senate bill. Otherwise we would never have had a unanimous vote in reporting this bill 20-0. But there is a provision in that House bill whereby if there has been a willful and malicious reporting to this agency--such as we saw in the tobacco case where they all raised their hands and you knew they were lying at the time--then there should be a criminal penalty. That ought to be cleared up in the House bill. 
   We are only asking that the Senate bill be considered so we can amend the House bill and work this measure out under the leadership of Senator MCCAIN. 
   The other provision with respect to the reporting of claims--after all that is the only way we found out about these recent deaths that now approximate 100 killed on the highways. As  they brought these claims down to a conclusion, the judge put them under what we call a gag order where they were not allowed to consider or consult or even talk about the final settlement. It was more or less kept top secret from the press and media, and nobody knew it was going on. 
   Of course, NHTSA has been practically dormant. They have not operated the tire safety requirements since the year 1973, and this reflects on us in the committee. 
   They have not had or ordered a single recall on tires in the last 5 years. 
   There have been 99 million overall safety vehicle recalls, but they have all been voluntary on account of the threats of lawsuits. We know that. It was only because of the word getting out about these lawsuits that we finally have gotten to pay attention to this, bringing out a bill, unanimously reported under the leadership of the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, which is totally bipartisan. 
   I join in the Senator's request, which I am confident he will make, that we be able to bring the Senate bill up, amend the House bill, work this out in the next few days--it could be worked out by tomorrow--and have a good measure that would save lives in America. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I don't want the Senator to take back his praise, but let me clear the record relative to trial lawyers. Trial lawyers got us where we are. If it hadn't been for trial lawyers bringing the cases and filing some of the reports made on the recoveries thereof, we would not have awakened, literally, and awakened our own Commerce Committee to have the hearings to put us on the floor this evening. 
   I am intimate with the trial lawyer movement in this country. I can tell you that they have become a whipping boy for Tom Donahue and his blooming Chamber of Commerce, and any time you want to pass some measure like the Y2K bill, the trial lawyers had no objection whatsoever. 
   I have to correct the record because the chairman said that is the contest that is going on, about the right to sue and everything else. They have the right. The right is there and neither the Senate bill nor the House bill denies that right. We strengthen it with the reporting and then make the reports public so they can be attained, and they can avoid going to court on cases and avoid trial lawyers. So this particular bill is agreed to by this particular trial lawyer--either the Senate or the House version this evening, right now. I would vote for either one of them. But I think we can get a much better bill with the Senate bill. I wanted to correct the comments made about the trial lawyers because they have been there bringing peace and justice and safety to America's consumers. They got us this far, and I am proud to commend the trial lawyers for doing their work and saving lives. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to emphasize the bipartisanship of the request made by my distinguished chairman, the Senator from Arizona, to get some kind of consent for S. 3059, the bill dealing with, of course, the defective equipment. We had extensive hearings. 
   Let me emphasize several things that we learned during the hearings. 
   One, generally speaking, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been--I do not want to say defunct; I will use an elaborative; dormant. The testimony showed there had not been a single recall ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in five years. They had not ordered a recall. 
   Now, of course, I have kept up on this because I have had to stand in the well defending my trial lawyer friends who really bring about far more safety than one would normally suspect. In the 5-year period, there have been 99 million recalls. And everybody can write a thank-you note to Mark Robinson in the Pinto case. He never collected a cent in his punitive damages. But once industry realized there could be just that--lawsuits --then they began to voluntarily have recalls. And that is what occurred here. 
   This defective tire situation, causing multiple deaths--over 100 that we know about in the United States--was not a result of recalls ordered by NHTSA. More or less, the lawsuits, even though gagged, had really brought it to the attention of NHTSA to get off the dime, wake up, and start acting. 
   So we brought together now a measured safety precaution where this will not occur again. And again, it has been simmered down somewhat from the unanimous vote. We have been working, on both sides, with consumer product safety officials, with the tire companies. I talked to the tire companies themselves. Their main objection, in a way, to that bill was dealing with foreign defects, in reporting foreign defects and otherwise. Of course, you can call it the A tire here in the United States and manufacture the B tire in another country like it is different, but it is the same tire. So we would want to know about the recalls in Saudi Arabia, which started first, in order to bring the attention here of the Firestone defect. 
   So we worked it out. Now here we have a unanimous report out. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as he just said a moment ago, had no objection to that bill coming up because he voted for it to be reported favorably to the floor of the Senate. Otherwise, the distinguished majority leader, as a member of our committee, voted for it. So there has to be an untying of this snarl or knot so that we can get things done. 
   The only reason we cannot get it done is that we cannot offer an amendment to the conference report. If the conference report were an item just called up, we could call up this amendment, have a time limit for 10 minutes to a side, and easily adopt or reject the amendment, which was the bill, S. 3059. But, of course, it is a conference report, and under the rules we cannot just bring it up as an amendment. I say that so everybody will understand. 
   But as the distinguished chairman of our committee, Senator MCCAIN, pointed out, we could easily agree to give it some kind of consideration--an hour to a side. It could be called up so we can stop this indiscriminate killing on the highways due to faulty equipment. 
   I think it ought to be emphasized that we found this out really as in getting past the gag orders. I do not like these gag orders, but sometimes they do promote settlements of judicial 
   disputes. So we do not have anything in the bill in relation to the gag orders. But when you get lawsuits--that means that you have gone to a lawyer; you have a serious injury or you maybe have a death case, or whatever it is--so when you get multiple lawsuits, then that notice is given, of course, to NHTSA, and we can act from there. 
   But it is a studied, deliberate, measured response. Generally speaking, they don't ever agree. I do not want to infer the industry agrees this is a good bill, but listening to them, they didn't have any serious objection that I can discern. 
   I support 100 percent Senator MCCAIN's movement on the floor. He is not holding things up. We can get a Transportation conference report to the President here on Friday. We can come in here on Tuesday, if there is a holiday on Monday. We can easily get it to the President. 
   And as has been indicated, it has already been approved. We know the White House folks watch and make sure their concerns are taken care of in the measure. So whether it gets there Friday, gets there Tuesday, next Wednesday, let's get on with having safety in America. 
   The Senator from Arizona standing in the well is not being an obstructionist whatsoever, but trying to promote safety where everybody is agreed. But, as he said, there is a ``fix'' on somewhere because why can't we just call up the bill and get an agreement and everything else of that kind? 
   Our distinguished leader, the Senator from Nevada, says perhaps there is not going to be any vote in the Senate. And the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee says, oh yes, we are going to have a vote to move to proceed. But that is not going to get us anywhere because with the vote to proceed, we will still have plenty of time to talk. And we will talk into next week, and talk into Tuesday and Wednesday, and everything else, to show to the American people that there is some kind of responsibility with this political entity here, the Senate. 
   Heavens above, when we have everybody agreed--it is totally bipartisan--why can't we move deliberately and bring it up and have a vote on it?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my displeasure and disappointment that two of the four major broadcast networks--NBC and Fox, have decided not to broadcast nationally, the presidential debate scheduled tonight between the Democratic and Republican candidates for President. 
   This election is likely to be among the closest national races in the last twenty years. In exchange for the use of spectrum without the imposition of a fee, broadcasters have to fulfill their public interest obligation. I do not believe it is too much to presume that showing vital news information such as a presidential debate is encompassed in a broadcaster's public interest obligation. 
   Instead of showing the debate, NBC is showing a divisional wildcard playoff baseball game, although they are apparently permitting their affiliates to broadcast the debate, if they so choose. Even more appalling, Fox is showing its new science fiction series produced by its own studio--Dark Angel--which I understand is particularly violent. 
   On Sunday, the Washington Post ran a story entitled--``Even Hits can Miss in TV's New Economy.'' That article outlined the enormous incentives the Networks have to air programs in which they possess a vested financial interest. I quote--  
   Just as a supermarket might reserve its best shelf space for its house brands, the networks have begun to favor their in house programs over shows created by others, which are often less profitable in the long term.  
   There it is Mr. President. Money trumps the political process once again. Fox has likely spent millions of dollars to develop and promote its new series, and NBC likely spent a significant amount of money to acquire the rights to broadcast a baseball playoff game. But Mr. President, when networks choose their own programming or sports programming over an event as significant as tonight's debate, they fail to meet their public interest obligation. Having to reschedule a baseball game or the debut of a new series created by their studios does not justify NBC or Fox precluding the public from having access to the presidential debates. I understand that one network, ABC, decided to postpone the debut of one of its new shows ``Gideon's Crossing'' by one night so as to air tonight's debate. That is called honoring your public interest obligation. By choosing not to air the debates, these other networks have undermined the integrity of the political process and our democracy, and engaged in a disrespect of the American electorate. 
   The political process should be covered. The American people deserve such coverage. The grant of free spectrum worth billions of dollars to broadcasters comes with a public interest obligation that requires them to inform the public of issues of vital importance--not simply to do what is financially expedient.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize Spartanburg, South Carolina and the South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind as hosts of the 2001 Pan American Games for the Blind. This is not only a distinguished honor for Spartanburg and for the school, but also for our state and our nation. Three hundred blind and visually-impaired elite athletes from 22 countries will compete in the third Pan Am Games for the Blind May 29-June 3, 2001 in Spartanburg. It marks the first time that these Games have been held in the United States. Previous competitions took place in Buenos Aires and Mexico City. 
   Athletes will compete in track and field events, swimming and goal ball, a team sport developed specifically for the blind. Two students at the S.C. School for the Deaf and Blind, Royal Mitchell and Sonya Bell, will represent the United States in track and field events. 
   The International Blind Sports Association selected the S.C. School for the Deaf and Blind as the site for the 2001 Games because of its excellent facilities and the strong credentials of the athletic staff. Since its founding in 1849, the school has served South Carolina well and proven itself worthy of this latest distinction. I wish all the participants in the 2001 Pan American Games for the Blind much success.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak today about airport security, and in particular, S. 2440, the Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000. 
   Our aviation security system in the United States and abroad is of extreme importance in protecting the traveling  public. Airport security is our first line of defense against terrorist attacks or other dangerous acts. We all know that our airport security personnel are underpaid and overworked. 
   Congress sets minimum security standards for the airports and airlines to meet, but implementing the standards is not a government function--that part is left to the airlines, airports and security personnel. We need to ensure, then, that the industry and security screeners are better prepared and that higher training standards are implemented. Security workers are characterized by a high rate of turnover. According to GAO's testimony in our April 6 hearing this year on aviation security, from May 1998 through April 1999, turnover averaged 126 percent among screeners at 19 large airports, and the average wage for screeners in the United States averages $5.75 per hour with minimal benefits. We can't expect security personnel who are receiving minimum-wage or near-minimum wage to realize just how important their jobs are to the overall security of the airport and to have a commitment to their jobs. On the other hand, security personnel also need to be held individually responsible for security lapses. Peoples' lives are at stake when there are security lapses. Employees who fail to follow procedures should be suspended or terminated.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support in passing S. 1534, a bill to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, which the Commerce Committee reported out favorably this session. First, I would like to commend Senators SNOWE and KERRY for their leadership on this very important reauthorization. 
   In 1969, the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources (the Stratton Commission) recommended that: ``..... a Coastal Zone Management Act be enacted which will provide policy objectives for the coastal zone and authorize federal grants-in-aid to facilitate the establishment of State Coastal Zone Authorities empowered to manage the coastal waters and adjacent land.'' 
   In response to this recommendation, Congress, in 1972, enacted coastal zone management legislation to balance coastal development and preservation needs. To encourage state participation, the CZMA established a voluntary, two-stage, state assistance program. The first stage, awarded ``section 305'' grants to coastal states for development of coastal management programs meeting certain federal requirements. State programs which were judged by the Secretary of Commerce to meet those requirements received Federal approval and became eligible for the second stage of grants. This second stage, under section 306, provides ongoing assistance for states to implement their federally-approved coastal programs. All grants require equal matching funds from the state. Since passage of the CZMA, all 34 eligible states and territories have participated in the program to some degree. Currently, 34 of the 35 eligible coastal states and territories have Federally approved plans. The approved plans include more than 100,000 miles of coastline, which represents nearly all of the national total covered by the Act. The Ohio, Georgia, and Texas, and Minnesota state CZMA programs all received federal approval within the past three years. Of the eligible states, only Illinois is not participating. 
   Let me note that the nature and structure of CZM programs vary widely from state to state. This diversity was intended by Congress. Some states, like North Carolina, passed comprehensive legislation as a framework for coastal management. Other states, like Oregon, used existing land use legislation as the foundation for their federally-approved programs. Finally, states like Florida and Massachusetts networked existing, single-purpose laws into a comprehensive umbrella for coastal 
   management. The national program, therefore, is founded in the authorities and powers of the coastal states and local governments. Through the CZMA, these collective authorities are orchestrated to serve the ``national interest in effective management, beneficial use, protection, and development of the coastal zone.'' This 28 year program is a success story of how the local, state and federal government can work together for the benefit of all who enjoy and rely on our coastal resources. 
   I am pleased to report that S. 1534 reauthorizes and strengthens a program that works well. It provides total authorizations of over $136 million, and adds a new Coastal Community Grant Program under section 309A for states that want to focus on coastal community-based initiatives. This provision is aimed at addressing the need for Federal and state support of community-based planning, strategies, and solutions for local sprawl and development issues in the coastal zone. In addition, it strengthens and provides increased authorizations for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, natural labs operated by the states that support management-oriented research needed by coastal resource managers, as well as educational and interpretive programs to improve public awareness and understanding of the coastal environment. 
   While the CZMA has proven greatly successful, the world has changed since 1972. Today, over half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of our shores--and more than 3,000 people move to the coast every day. In addition, more than 30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product is generated in the coastal zone. In my state of South Carolina, our beaches now attract millions of visitors every year, all year long, placing greater demands on our coastal resources than every before. And more and more people are choosing to move to the coast--making the coastal counties the fastest growing ones in the state. With population growth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, schools, and sewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are to continue to live and work on the coast, we must allow our states to do a better job of planning how we impact the very regions in which we all want to live. 
   Strengthening the CZMA is one important step in addressing these problems. These changes also call for another look at our overall ocean and coastal policy, which is why Congress this year enacted the Oceans Act of 2000, with the strong bipartisan support, including that of Senators SNOWE, KERRY, STEVENS and BREAUX. Through reauthorization and strengthening of the CZMA and creation of a new Ocean Policy Commission called for in the Oceans Act, we are on track in the year 2000 to continue and improve upon the good work started by the Stratton Commission in 1969.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I cannot agree with the premise of the H1B Visa bill. Affluent America with all of its opportunities cannot be designated skill-short. I have been in the game of technical training for skills for years. At present we are attracting high-tech industries, like Black Baud, training computer operators overnight. Stop for a moment and analyze the zeal behind this movement. We have learned that 20 percent of Microsoft employees are part-time. The employees had brought a suit in 1992 so that they would receive stock options, health care and retirement benefits as other workers performing the same task. By 1998 these workers had prevailed in the courts, but Microsoft put them all on part-time employment. The trend in these high-tech industries is to part-time. Today this amounts to 20 to 30 percent of those at Redmond, Washington. In Silicon Valley 42 percent of the employ is part-time. So high-tech is not providing the paying jobs to support a middle class in America. High-tech is looking to bring in the so-called Indian or Chinese talented at a $40,000 per year rate. But these jobs can and should be trained for in the United States. In fact, that is what they have told the 38,700 textile workers in South Carolina who have lost their jobs since NAFTA. ``We have moved into a new economy'' is the cry with the rejoinder, ``retrain, retrain.'' So, as I set about retraining them for high-tech, the Congress prepares to superimpose 600,000 foreign trained before they have had a chance to compete in the new economy. Mind you me, I am devoted to advanced technology. I authored the successful advanced technology program now ongoing in the Department of Commerce. I believe America's security rests with its superiority in technology. But high-tech doesn't provide the number of jobs that manufacture does. Microsoft has 21,000 employees in Redmond, Washington; Boeing has 100,000. And high-tech doesn't pay. I know firsthand that we can train the cotton picker to become a skilled automobile manufacturer. We have done this at BMW in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Incidentally, the quality of the product of the South Carolina BMW plant exceeds the quality of the Munich product. What we are really facing is a foot race for the high-tech political money. I saw this in the farcical Y2K law adopted by the Congress. We saw it again in the foot race for the estate tax legislation to take care of 100 new Internet billionaires. And now we presume a non-existent national crisis in H1B for the high-tech political contributions. I am not joining in this charade.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now here is one thing with which I can  agree, and not be in a minority. Dr. Joab M. Lesesne, Jr. has not only headed Wofford College with distinction for 28 years, but he has brought luster to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities as its Chairman. A man of many talents, Joe served as a general in the South Carolina National Guard and is presently Chairman of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Governing Board. Dr. Shi, the eminent President of Furman University, cites this record better than I in a recent editorial in the Greenville News. I ask that the editorial be reprinted in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one would think from the comments made by my distinguished friend from New Jersey and others that the issue was the welfare and benefit of the People's Republic of China. I have no particular gripe at this moment about China. I think, as the Senator from New Jersey pointed out, it is working. China has a very competitive trade policy. They are making improvements industrially, economically, even environmentally, and perhaps with labor standards. That is not the issue. 
   The issue is the viable, competitive trade policy of the United States of America. You would think that we had the finest, most wonderfully competitive trade policy there could be. The fact is, we have a $350 billion trade deficit that we know of, and this year, 2000, it is going to approximate $400 billion. 
   Last month, the Department of Commerce announced we had lost 69,000 manufacturing jobs. The fact is, we have gone from the end of World War II, with some 42 percent of our workforce in manufacturing, down to 12 percent. 
   As the head of Sony--the Japanese just beat us in softball last night, and they are beating us in trade--as the head of Sony, Akio Morita, said, that world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. 
   We hear high tech, high tech. They are running around here as if they have discovered something. Senator, you don't understand global competition, they say. We have high tech. We want to get away from the smokestack jobs to the high-tech jobs. 
   Let me say a word about that. I know something about both. I have both. I would much rather have BMW than Oracle or Microsoft. Why do I say that? BMW is paying $21 an hour. A third of Microsoft's workers are paid $10 an hour, part time, temporary workers, Silicon Valley. Forty-two percent of the workers in Silicon Valley are part-time, temporary workers. I am not looking for temporary jobs. I am looking for hardcore middle America jobs. 
   That is the competition. The competition in global competition is market share and jobs. We treat foreign trade as foreign aid. Free trade, free trade. They say: You don't understand high tech. The truth is, we have a deficit in the balance of trade in advanced technology products with the People's Republic of China. Last year, it was $3.2 billion. It will approximate $5 billion this year. 
   But Senator, agriculture. Agriculture? There is a glut of agriculture in the People's Republic. Once they solve their transportation and distribution problems, they are not only going to feed the 1.3 billion, but the rest of the world. Come now, the 800 million farmers they have at the moment can certainly outproduce the 3.5 million farmers we have in America. 
   We had a deficit in the balance of trade of $218 million last year with the People's Republic of China. People don't understand where we are. I have a deficit in the balance of trade of cotton. I am importing cotton from the People's Republic of China. 
   They say: Wait a minute, what about the airplanes? Well, yes, they have orders for 1,600, we just heard a minute ago. We will cut that in half. That is really 800, because 50 percent, according to Bill Greider of the 777 Boeing plane, is going to be made in downtown Shanghai. The MD 3010, 70 percent of that aircraft is made in the People's Republic of China. So what are we doing? Are we transferring all of the wonderful middle-class American jobs to China? 
   And we are running all over the country hollering, ``I am for the working families, I am for the working families,'' when, since NAFTA, they have eliminated 30,700 working families in my little State of South Carolina. We lost over 500,000 over the Nation. So we are eliminating working families, and we say, ``But China is going to  really start enforcing and adhering and be made accountable.'' Not at all. 
   Japan is not. Incidentally, Japan has been in the WTO for 5 years and it hasn't opened up yet. I don't know where they get the idea that once we get this particular agreement and China in the WTO, it is going to open its market. That doesn't open markets. Otherwise accountable? The People's Republic see what happened with the United States and Japan and with the United States and the United Kingdom. The President was up in New York the week before last with Prime Minister Blair, and the Prime Minister is fighting for a thousand jobs, and the President of the United States is exporting them like gang busters and fighting for bananas that we don't even produce. Fighting for bananas. Come on. When are we going to sober up and get a competitive trade policy? 
   For a second, I don't have the idea that we ought to cut off trade; that is ridiculous because it is impossible. We are going to trade with China. I just want to cut the word ``permanent'' out and have a look-see and try to get organized a trade policy whereby we can correlate 20 different departments and agencies, our Department of Commerce and Trade, and start really competing in a controlled global economy. 
   The fight there, of course, as I see it, is for market share. The fight is for jobs. We are not doing it. I guess my time is pretty well limited. 
   Alexander Hamilton enunciated the competitive trade policy of the People's Republic of China in 1789. The first was for the Seal of the United States. The second bill that passed this Congress in July 1789 was a 50-percent tariff on 60 articles. Protectionism. We learn how to build up. The Brits suggested to us that we trade with them what we produce best and they trade back what they produce best. Free trade, free trade. Hamilton, in his writing ``Report on Manufacturers,'' told the Brits: Bug off, we are not going to remain your colony, exporting our raw materials, our agriculture, our timber, our iron ore, and importing your manufactured products. And therein is the policy of the People's Republic of China. I welcome it. I welcome the competition. But you can't find it here in the Congress. You can't find it in the Presidential race. 
   You would think we had a good policy of some kind. Nothing on the floor. People are coming up here, like myself, reciting their little positions, with no debate. Somebody said ``invigorating debate.'' They couldn't care less. This vote has been fixed. This thing has been fixed since midsummer. You know it and I know it. They will give you time. There is nobody seated on the other side. Let the RECORD show that. Absolutely nobody is in a chair on the Republican side of the Senate as I speak. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have tried, in my feeble ability here over the years, to get the Senate to pay attention to the lack of a competitive trade policy. I had hoped on this PNTR, permanent normal trade relations, with China that we might have a good debate with respect to our trade policy--whether or not the American people approve of it and whether there are some adjustments that should be made. Meanwhile our trade deficit goes up, up, and away. 
   I was a Senator here in the early 1980s when we had a positive balance of trade. I remember when it reached a $100 billion deficit in the balance of trade; and there were all kinds of headline articles back in the 1980s, that--Chicken Little--the sky was going to fall, and everything else like that. 
   Now we have been numbed. It has gone to $100, $200, $300 billion, and it approximates to a $400 billion deficit in the balance of trade. They don't even discuss it in the Presidential campaign. And they absolutely refuse to discuss it in the world's most deliberative body. They refuse to deliberate. 
   They bring a fixed bill to the floor. And it is terribly tough to talk to a fixed jury. But that is the way it is. The jury is fixed. The legislation is fixed. There are no amendments. We send this to the President. 
   The National Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board and the National Association of Manufacturers are continuing their export of the industrial backbone of this Nation. Obviously, they make a bigger profit. They could care less about the country. 
   In fact, years back, the chairman of the board of Caterpillar said: We are not an American company, we are international. 
   Not long ago, earlier this year, the head of Boeing said: Oh no, we are not a United States company, we are an international company. 
   And the best of the best, Jack Welch of GE says: We are not going to buy  from our suppliers unless they send those jobs down to Mexico. 
   There is a good, wonderful Business Week article about that--we are limited in time or I would read it--but that is exactly what he said. Unless his subcontractors went to Mexico, he was going to do business with those who had gone. So we are in one heck of a fix. 
   They do not understand trade. Free trade is, of course, an oxymoron. Trade is an exchange for something. It is not to give something for nothing. It is not aid. But we have been treating foreign trade--free trade--as foreign aid. 
   They just ipso facto in those polls: Are you for free trade? 
   Oh, I am for free trade, obviously. 
   Obviously, they are trying to say: I am for trade without restrictions and barriers. 
   But mind you me, we are all for world peace, but we do not disband the Pentagon. As the father of the country said: The best way to preserve the peace is to prepare for war. 
   The best way to obtain free trade is not to roll over, as we have for the past 50 years, and plead and cry and moan and groan: 
   fair, fair, fair, fair. 
   Whoever heard of anybody in business being fair? In America, business, unfortunately, is solely for profit. Do not give us any of these ``fairness doctrines'' of the board of directors of corporate America. You have to be able to raise a barrier in order to remove a barrier. You have to compete. All we need is a competitive trade policy. 
   In that light, let me say at the outset, I am not against China. All of these amendments have been very good ones with respect to the human rights in China, with respect to weapons of mass destruction, with China not keeping its commitments, and so forth. Why should they keep their commitments? Japan never has. Come on. Korea knows that. China learns. Monkey see, monkey do. They said: All you have to do is puff and blow. We'll get together. And America--the United States--will roll over. 
   So don't come around here berating China. Buy yourself a mirror and look in it. It is the Senate. Article 1, section 8, of the Constitution says: The Congress shall regulate foreign commerce--not the President, not the Supreme Court, not the Special Trade Representative, but the Congress of the United States. And although the Trade Representative is running around trying to forge new agreements that contradict our laws, even those, if they are to take the force and effect of law, have to be in the form of a treaty ratified by this Senate. 
   So we are way out of kilter and acting with total disregard. We have gone, from the end of World War II, from 41 percent of our workforce in manufacturing down to 12 percent. The Department of Commerce just reported this last month of August, we lost 69,000 manufacturing jobs. 
   I will never forget the exchange with the former head of Sony up in Chicago. He was lecturing the Third World, the emerging nations, and said for them to become a nation-state, they had to develop a manufacturing capacity. Somewhat afterward, pointing at me, he said: By the way, Senator, that world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. 
   The security of the United States is like a three-legged stool. The one leg, of course, is our values. We are respected the world around for our commitment to freedom and human rights. The second leg, obviously, is the military, the superpower. But the third economic leg has been fractured over the past 50 years, as we have made a very successful attempt to conquer communism with capitalism. We sent over the Marshall Plan. We sent over the technology. We sent over the expertise. But we rolled over with respect to actually enforcing any kind of trade policy. 
   I testified, some 40 years ago, before the old International Tariff Commission. Tom Dewey ran me around the room. The argument was: Governor, what do you expect these emerging countries, coming out of the ruins of the war, what do you expect them to make? Let them and the Third World countries, let them make the shoes and the clothing, and we will make the airplanes and the computers. 
   Now I stand on the floor, and our global competition, they make the shoes. They make the clothing. They make the airplanes. They make the computers. They make it all. And we are going out of business. 
   And as we go out of business, they say this particular initiative, PNTR, is good for business. It is good for their profit, but not, in the long run, good for business, no. They have to have employees. And don't worry about the productivity of the U.S. industrial worker. We have been for 30-some years now rated not only by the Bureau of Labor Statistics but by the international economic section of the United Nations as having the most productive industrial worker in the entire world. 
   They are working harder and harder and longer hours and are getting paid less than they are in Germany, paid less than they are in Japan and several other countries. The U.S. industrial worker is not overpaid, and he is not underworked. He works more hours than any other industrial worker. 
   Here we are, in the Senate, blabbing, be fair, whining, be fair, be fair. We continue to heap on the cost of doing business--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave. You can go right on down the list of all of these things we think up, and we, on a bipartisan basis, support them all. That goes into the cost of doing business. So since NAFTA, 38,700 jobs have left the little State of South Carolina and gone down to Mexico where none of those conditions I just mentioned are required, and they have the audacity to stand in the well and say NAFTA worked. 
   They told us at the time of the NAFTA vote it was going to create jobs; 200,000 is the figure they used. The Chamber of Commerce, the NAM, Business Roundtable, the Secretary of Commerce, the President of the United States: We are going to create 200,000 jobs. 
   We have lost 440,000 textile jobs alone since NAFTA. I don't know how many jobs they have lost up in New Hampshire, but I am confident I can go over to the Department of Labor and find out. Jobs are our greatest export. Export, export, from those who have never really been in trade--I practiced customs law--they keep hollering, export, export. The biggest export we have is our jobs. 
   I am not against China. I am against us. That is who I am 
   trying to awaken with these amendments, trying to engage in a debate so we can learn from a country with a $350- to $400 billion trade deficit, costing 1 percent of our GNP. They keep saying: Watch out, that dollar is going to have to be devalued. You watch it, when that happens, interest rates go up. Then they will all be whining around here. 
   I remember the little $5 billion we put in some 25 years ago--we were trying to create jobs--$5 billion for the highways, just to advance highway construction, just to create jobs. Five billion? We have lost billions of dollars just this last month, way more than $5 billion in jobs; I can tell you that. 
   The idea is, as President Lincoln said, and there is no quote more appropriate:  
   The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.  
   That was in his annual message to the Congress back in December of 1862. We must disenthrall ourselves. We must act anew, think anew, disenthrall ourselves, and try to save us, the great Yankee trader from New Hampshire, and all of those other Northeastern States. We had all this agriculture down South, and we believed in all that international trade. That was the Civil War. That famous Yankee trader has rolled over now, and he has gone overseas. 
   We are definitely not against China. I could talk at length about their human rights policy. Their first human right is to feed 1.3 billion. The second is to house 1.3 billion. The third is to educate 1.3 billion. The fourth is one man, one vote. But, of course, the politicians are running around on the floor of the Congress: We want one man, one vote. You travel there. I was there in 1976 and 1986 and 1996. You go there and you see the progress towards capitalism. 
   I am for continued trade. I have offered to cut out the ``permanent'' so I  could continue this dialog with my colleagues on the floor to try to get something going of a competitive nature. 
   We certainly don't go along with Tiananmen Square and everything else such as that, but it works for the Chinese. Suppose you were the head of China. If you let one demonstration get out of hand, another one gets out of hand. You have total chaos, with a population of 1.3 billion. Then nothing gets done. So there has to be some kind of traumatic control; let's be realistic. Don't berate them about their environment right now. It took us 200 years, and we still don't have these waste dumps cleaned up. We still don't have clean air in certain States. Workers' rights, we haven't gotten all of our workers' rights. They don't have a right to a job because they are fast disappearing. That is what it is all about. And it is not against business. 
   Jerry Jasinowski, the distinguished head of the National Association of Manufacturers, put an article in yesterday's New York Times, entitled ``Gore's War on Business.'' I ask unanimous consent to print the article in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. These workers, he says, have been duly rewarded. Not at all. He talks about the manufacturing pay is less than their competition, that they are working long hours. They haven't been duly rewarded. What is the unease, the anxiety that they are talking about? The anxiety they are talking about is having the job. The great success of business in creating good jobs seems to be lost. He should have read the release put out the day before.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. You have to read this one line, quoting Jasinowski:  
   Of the total $228 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit, so far this year 77 percent has been in manufacturing.  
   That is a deficit in manufacturing. Can you imagine that, Mr. President? So the leaders of business and the head of manufacturing say get rid of the manufacturing. He seems to be proud of it. If I had found that statistic in my research, I would have secured it and stuck it, or deep-sixed it, or whatever you call it because you didn't really want to publicize the fact that you are losing the manufacturing jobs. 
   With respect to understanding the need to have a competitive trade policy, the President of the United States was up in New York just last week, and he had his counterpart from London there, Tony Blair. They were talking. The news reports said Tony Blair was worried about 1,000 cashmere jobs. Why? Because we were going to put  some heavy duty tariff on cashmere. For what? For bananas. We don't even produce bananas. Good Lord, have mercy. That is how far out the leadership of this country has gone. We don't even produce bananas. But Europe is not taking some other country's bananas, so we go and say we are going to start a trade war. 
   The Prime Minister is worried about 1,000 jobs, and here I am worried about at least 800,000 jobs. Tell Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce--he says he is going to create 800,000 jobs. I bet you we will lose that number of jobs with this PNTR. He knows it and I know it. They are all begging for jobs, and the President is worried and everything else of that kind, and even the media don't know what protectionism is. That is what you will soon listen to--protectionism. I hold up my hand to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. They said, ``Hollings' crude defense of protectionism.'' They don't know what protectionism is. When you get the Government out of the competition, you do get free capitalistic activity, as Adam Smith said. Followed on by David Ricardo and his so-called comparative advantage, which said when you put the Government in, the Government has the right to print money. The Government certainly is not going to let the industry fail. 
   Deutsche Telekom had a bond issued earlier this year and got $14 billion. Their stock has gone from 100 down to 40. The fellow brags in the newspaper: I have $100 billion in my back pocket. I am going to buy AT&T, MCI, Sprint, or any of them--they are all subject--and I want total control. 
   So what he has told you in plain, bold language is that the German Government, which owns Deutsche Telekom, says: Heads up, I'm coming in to buy your companies and get total control. 
   That is a distortion of the free market. That would be protectionism. I am trying to avoid that and keep the Government out of the market. I was one of the leaders in the 1996 act deregulating telecommunications. So we got the U.S. Government out, but certainly not to put the German Government in. But here they go writing these editorials about I'm a protectionist. They have no idea what's going on. That is how far off we have gotten with respect to trade. 
   So let's get to the point. What we do is that we trade more. We export more to Belgium. We export more to the city-state of Singapore than we do to the People's Republic of China. We've got a good, viable trade partner there. We don't have any exports. I will get to the technology on another amendment. They said that high-tech is going to do it. The truth is, high tech doesn't create the jobs. I will put it in one line: We have a deficit and a balance of trade in high technology with the People's Republic of China. So mark you me, this is not going to do it whatsoever. So my amendment, which ought to be read simply so we can find out who is telling the truth and find out what the imports and exports are and what the jobs are and where they are going. Here it is:  
   The Securities and Exchange Commission shall amend its regulations to require the inclusion of the following information in 10-K reports required to be filed with the commission.  
   This is just information.  
   The number of employees employed by the reporting entity outside the United States directly, indirectly, or through a joint venture or other business arrangement listed by country; the annual dollar volume of exports of goods manufactured or produced in the United States by the reporting entity to each country to which it exports; the annual dollar volume of imports of goods manufactured or produced outside the United States by the reporting entity with each country.  
   So we will find out with these reports just exactly where we are and what the competition is, whether they are increasing jobs in the U.S. rather than decreasing. The opposition to this amendment is telling everybody to forget about it, it is another one of those Hollings amendments and we have to send it to the President and we have other more important business--there is no more important business than what is going on on the floor of the Senate--10-K reports. 
   I don't want to belabor or compound the record itself, but I have in my hand the Boeing 10-K report. For example, Boeing, on its 10-K report, says ``the location and floor areas of the company's principal operating properties as of January 1, 2000.'' I wish you or somebody who is really interested could look at that 10-K report. They have every little item about the square footage. 
   They know how many employees. They know generally how many employees they have, but they do not say where and what country. 
   That is all we are asking for--the number of employees; then, the dollar volume of imports and exports, and from whence. That is all. 
   That is all we are asking for in this particular amendment so we can get that to the Department of Commerce and finally find out. 
   Back in the 1970s when we were debating trade, the Department of Commerce gave me this figure: 41 percent of American consumption of manufactured goods was from imports. That was 20-some years ago. I know that over half of what you and I consume is imported. We are going out of business. We don't have a strong nation. High-tech is not strengthening whatsoever--temporary employees and software people and Internet billionaires, as Newsweek wrote about the other day. But they are not really the automobile workers and parts workers or industry workers. We have the so-called ``rust belt'' in the United States. Talk how exports--that is the parts they are still  making up there and sending down to Mexico to come back into finished automobiles. The most productive automobile plant in the world is not Detroit. It is down in Mexico at the Ford plant, according to J.D. Powers. 
   I have the Bell South 10-K report. As of December 31, 1999, they employed approximately 96,200 individuals; 64,000 were employees of the telephone operation, and 55,000 represented the communications workers. They have a lot of detailed information. But all we want is the number and which country. That is all we are asking for with respect to those employees--their imports and exports. 
   Why did the Boeing machinists lead the parade last December up in Seattle at the World Trade Organization? The premium showcase export industry of the United States was leading the parade against WTO because their jobs have gone to China. 
   All you have to do is continue to read the different articles. 
   We have one with respect to our friend Bill Greider, who put out a very interesting article. He wrote when President Clinton promoted Boeing aircraft sales abroad--boy, that was wonderful. He had gotten Boeing. For instance, he did not mention that in effect he was championing Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, and Fuji, the Japanese heavies that manufacture a substantial portion of Boeing' planes; or that Boeing was offloading jobs from Seattle and Wichita to China as part of the deal. 
   There it is. We are exporting our jobs. 
   This book is nearly 6 years of age. 
   But let me retain the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the privilege and experience of running a corporation myself. In fact, it was before Manny Cohen was the Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At that time, I set a  record getting approval in 13 days. I know how it works. I know how detailed it is. That is why I brought up Boeing. They even have the square footage in different countries. They do have the total amount and the number of employees. They just break it down by country. 
   Exporters and importers have to keep books. They have to have the value. They want to know themselves. I want it reported in their 10-K. It is not at the Department of Commerce. 
   By the way, they say the information does not affect the bottom line. It most positively does. You can get your labor production costs and manufacture for 10 percent of the United States cost. 
   I am not here for stockholders or against them. I am for stockholders, nonstockholders, for the people of the United States, for the Senate, and for the Constitution in conducting trade.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point here, there are two surprising features with respect to the globalization, global competition, international trade. I continue to try to get the Senate and the Congress itself, charged under the Constitution, article I, section 8, to fulfill its responsibility. 
   The eye-opener has to do with agriculture, and the eye-opener has to do with technology. This particular amendment deals with the technological argument that we hear about the wonderful opportunity we have that ``you just don't understand, Senator.'' That is what we hear--that we have gone from the smokestack to post-industrial to high-tech. Everybody is running around talking about high-tech and the wonderful economy. Well, I wish high-tech did contribute that much to the economy. But the fact of the matter is there are not that many jobs, and the few jobs that are there just don't pay. 
   Let me summarize this amendment. I ask, as a result, that the balance of trade with China in advanced technology projects be reported by the President to the Congress each year. That is in advanced technology products in an amount in excess of $5 billion. We now have a deficit in the balance of trade with the People's Republic of China of $3.2 billion, as of the end of 1999. 
   Now I have heard from the best of sources that that deficit could become an approximate $5 billion. So I am asking the President that if it exceeds $5 billion, we not only report it, but request a negotiation with the People's Republic of China to see if we can eliminate that imbalance. That is all the amendment calls for. It is all permissive requests, asking the President to do it. There is no burden whatsoever, but it is certainly in the context of global competition that we talk about it. 
   Let's start acting as if we know something about the competition. I say that the jobs don't pay and there are not that many of them. Right to the point, by comparison, for example, in Redmond, WA, Microsoft has 21,000 jobs when Boeing down the road has 100,000. There are many more jobs at General Motors, Ford, the auto parts industry, and otherwise, than there are in high-tech. 
   There is a lot of money in software, and therein you find these Internet billionaires trying to get market share--not profit. They haven't come out with a profit yet. But there has been a footrace on the New York Stock Exchange to get market share and invest in those who are winners. That is understandable. That is fine. That is the American way. We applaud it. However, when you look at the number of jobs, you can go to Oracle, you can go to America Online. They now have their employees in the Philippines. Microsoft has several thousand of its employees offshore. 
   In 1992, a suit was brought by the so-called ``part-time temporary'' employees claiming they ought to share in these stock options, other health benefits, and otherwise. They are really working full time. They won the suit. Now they have changed them to temporary employees so they are not allowed to work over 364 days a year to comply with the law. 
   This is an article from around the beginning of the year. In Santa Clara, the heart of Silicon Valley, the number of temporary workers has jumped to 42 percent of the workforce this year, from 19 percent in the 1980s. With respect to Microsoft, temporary workers have accounted for as much as one-third of its roughly 20,000-person workforce in the Puget Sound area. In May, it stood at 5,300. 
   I know the industrial workers at BMW, for example, have benefits and earn $21 to $22 an hour in Spartanburg, SC. We enjoy that. We appreciate it. It doesn't call for necessarily a computer expert or college graduate. There are many college graduates, of course, in the workforce. But these are jobs for high school graduates--the majority of our working population. 
   These are the jobs for the seniors in the middle class of our democracy. Everybody is running around as if there is joy in the world on money. But they are not thinking of the strength of the democracy economically and the strength the middle class brings to our democracy, with jobs for high school graduates and not just high-tech college degrees. Of course, it is said that the technology industry now has a shortage. There is no shortage. If they only gave them full-time work, they would be there. What they are really applying for are the college graduates out of India and other countries to come in under the immigration laws. They don't want to have to pay the temporary workers even around $35,000 a year when they can get Indian workers for $25,000 a year--any way they can cut costs. Even Chinese-trained workers and others come in. They would like to change the immigration laws to cut back the permanent high-paid workforce and put in this low-paid temporary work practice. That is an eye opener to me because I just couldn't understand why they couldn't find skilled workers. 
   The truth is, I have proof. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. It is not just bragging. It is true, as they say. We have the best in technical training in South Carolina, and we are for high tech. There isn't any question about that. We are attracting Hoffman-LaRoche, Hitachi, Honda--go right on down the list--Michelin, and all the rest of the fine industries from afar. We are proud of it. We are proud of these foreign investors. At the same time, we have to compete and maintain the strength of our economy. 
   Look at the People's Republic of China and the comparison of exports to imports in advanced technology. The parts of advanced machinery deficit is $18.23 billion; parts and accessories of machinery not incorporating, $7.74 billion; parts of turbojet or turbo-propeller engines $4.01 billion; turbojet aircraft engines, $3.74 billion. 
   These are all deficits with the People's Republic of China. 
   Parts for printers, $3.52 billion; cellular radio telephones, $3.2 billion; videocassette cartridge recorders, $2.32 billion; display units, $1.64 billion; optical disk players, $1.64 billion; medical and surgical instruments and appliances, $1.22 billion; 
   transistors, $740 million; facsimile machines, $670 million; television receivers, $57 million; laser printers, $480 million. 
   I could keep going down the list. The point is that we have had a great relationship with the People's Republic of China. But in the required transfers of technology, that plus balance of trade has now resulted in a deficit in the balance of trade. 
   Advanced technology products represent a rare consistent source of earnings for the United States. During the last decade alone, the surplus in global sales was $278 billion. But during the same period, U.S. trade deficits with China totaled $342 billion. It is worsening every year. 
   That has occurred in spite of the numerous agreements with China to end the obligatory transfer of technology from U.S. companies to their Chinese counterparts to protect intellectual property and to ensure regulatory transparency and the rule of law. Failure to implement these agreements goes a long way in explaining why the total U.S. deficit with China has doubled from $338 billion in 1995, to $68.7 billion by the end of 1999. 
   The United States also lost its technological trade surplus with China in 1995 and has suffered deficits in this area every year since then. 
   Last year, U.S. technology exports to China failed by 17 percent while the imports soared by 34 percent. The record $3.2 billion technology trade deficit in 1999 may reach $5 billion. This year, technology imports now cost twice as much as the falling U.S. exports. 
   Quite simply, China is developing its own export-driven, high-tech industry, and with U.S. assistance. 
   A recent Department of Commerce study found that transferring important technology and next generation scientific research to Chinese companies is required for any access to the Chinese cheap labor force or its market. 
   Three of the most critical technology areas are computers, telecommunications, and aerospace. The United  States lost its surplus in computers and components to China in 1990, and now pays seven times as much for imports as it earns from exports. 
   Compaq: Another foreign computer company that once dominated the Chinese market a decade ago has now been displaced by a local company. 
   After 20 years of normal trade relations with China, no mobile telephones are exported from the United States to China. Indeed, the United States trade with China in mobile phones involves only the payment for rapidly rising imports that now cost $100 million a year. China has total control of its telephone networks. It recently abrogated a big contract with Qualcom, Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia and sold 85 percent of China's mobile phone handsets until recently. Last November, China's Ministry of Information imposed import and production quotas on mobile phones, producers, and substantial support for nine Chinese companies. 
   Now, this agreement doesn't disturb those quotas. It does not open up that market. The People's Republic of China expects the nine companies to raise their market share from the current 5 percent to 50 percent within 5 years. 
   The United States now has a large and rapidly growing deficit with China in advanced radar and navigational devices. Nearly half of all U.S. technology exports to China during the 1980s were Boeing aircraft and 59 percent were in aerospace. But according to the SEC filings, Boeing's gross sales to and in China have generally fallen since 1993. 
   Incidentally, that is easy to report. It is being reported by Boeing and we just asked all of the companies to do what Boeing is doing. 
   Boeing MD 90-30 was certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last November with Chinese companies providing 70 percent of local contents. 
   That is a Chinese airline, and they wonder why the Boeing workers led the strike in Seattle last December. 
   More troubling, with the help of Boeing, Airbus, and others, China has developed its own increasingly competitive civilian and military aerospace production within 10 massive state-owned conglomerates. 
   China is a valuable U.S. partner in many matters, but it is also a significant competitor. Experiences in the United States with deficits worsening after tariff cuts and other agreements show this is not the time to abandon strong U.S. trade laws, but rather to begin to apply them fairly and firmly, since 42 percent of China's worldwide exports go to the United States. 
   The Chinese know how to compete. In 1990, we passed in the United Nations General Assembly a resolution to have hearings with respect to human rights in the People's Republic of China. I will never forget, they fanned out over the Pacific down into Australia, Africa, India and everywhere else, and of course they are very competitive. What do they do? The Chinese focus their diplomatic efforts on separating West European governments from the United States by offering them token political concessions and hinting they would retaliate economically against any country that supported the resolution in Geneva. 
   A vote after 7 years, each year, and the 7th year it was turned down again by a vote of 27-17. They know how to use their valuable, mammoth 1.3 billion population market. But we, with the richest market in the world, don't want to use it. Be fair, we whine; we continue to be fair and whine. 
   Now, with that $68 to $70 billion deficit in the balance of trade, that is their 8-percent growth. We could say we are just not going to continue this one-sided deal and we are not going to continue to import their articles. We will just stop them as they have stopped us, and with the growth they have to have, they will come to the table and talk turkey. There is no chance in the world with these children here who are in charge of our trade policy. They keep going up there to talk and talk. 
   Again, Ambassador Barshefsky testified at the hearings: ``The rules put an absolute end to forced technology transfers.'' That was after the WTO agreement with the People's Republic of China. ``The rules put an absolute end to forced technology transfers''--but fast forward a few months. This is what they had in the Wall Street Journal, from Wednesday, June 7 of this year: ``Qualcom Learns from its Mistakes in China, U.S. Mobile Phone Maker Listens to Beijing's Call for Local Production.'' 
   They report that after losing a lucrative deal to supply off-the-shelf cellular phones to China, Qualcom is mapping a new strategy to sell next-generation products in the world's fastest growing mobile phone market. 
   In other words, to send over their technology. 
   They talk about these agreements, but as John Mitchell, the former Attorney General said: Watch what we do, not what we say. 
   Look at what they actually do and it is a disaster.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, I know the managers of the bill have very important business to engage them, but what we are seeing here is really not just an insult to the issue at hand and this particular Senator, but what we are seeing is an insult to the Senate as the most deliberative body in the world. What they do, with respect, rather than engaging in debate, is go into the morning hour and talk about prescription medicine and Wen Ho Lee or anybody else they want to talk about--anything except trade. They know they have the vote fixed. 
   We have had the requirement, under the Pastore rule, that you address your comments to the subject at hand. I never have wanted to call that rule on the colleagues, but I will be forced to if we are going to come back and just have morning hours. 
   I was in a caucus earlier here at lunch. People are trying to get out of town tomorrow. I am trying to cooperate with respect to having early votes. I am willing to yield back the remainder of my time on this one. If I can hear any disputed evidence or testimony from the other side, I will be glad, then, to debate it. But if that is what they want to do, I will move on to the next amendment. I hope they get the message so we get somebody to the floor and move the amendments just as expeditiously as we can. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum and charge the other side because they don't care. I mean they are not even using the time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4135. Mr. President, the other eye opener in international trade is the matter of agriculture. I have always had a strong agricultural interest, support, in my years in public office. I willingly support price supports and quotas on agricultural products. America's agriculture is allegedly the finest in the world. We produce enough to feed ourselves and 15 other countries. But we only have 3.5 million farmers and there are 800 million farmers in the People's Republic of China. They are not only now producing to the extent where they have a glut--mind you me, I said that advisedly--a glut in agriculture, they will continue to expand upon their agricultural production once they solve the transportation and distribution problem, and start feeding the entire world. 
   It is very difficult to understand how any of my farm friends here--who are always calling us protectionists when we have never asked for any kind of subsidies or protection whatsoever--but if people lose their jobs, 38,700 who have lost their textile jobs, they are supposed to be retrained, you know, and get ready for high tech and the global economy. They are supposed to understand it. 
   Agriculturally, if a few thousand farms lose out here with the bad weather, be it a storm or be it a drought, we immediately appropriate the money to take care of it. I will never forget this so-called Freedom to Farm measure that was put in here 3 years ago. Each year, now, we have gone up and increased--rather than the freedom, the subsidies: Some $7 to $8 billion. 
   In contrast now, with the People's Republic of China, we have a deficit in a lot of items. The total agricultural trade balance is $218 million for the year 1999.  
   Fish and crustaceans, $266 million; dairy products, $14 million--$266 million. 
   Dairy produce; Birds' Eggs, Honey; Edible--$14.8 million.  
   This is how they list it and that is why I read it this way.  
   Products Of Animal Origin, Nesoi--$93.7 million. 
   Live Trees And Other Plants; Bulbs, Roots--$3.7 million; 
   Edible Vegetables And Certain Roots, Tubers--$55.8 million; 
   Edible Fruit And Nuts; Peel Of Citrus Fruit--$30.6 million; 
   Coffee, Tea, Mate And Spices--a deficit of $43.1 million; 
   Lac; Gums; Resins And Other Vegetable Saps--$44.9 million; 
   Edible Preparations Of Meat, Fish, Crustaceans--$69.9 million; 
   Sugars And Sugar Confectionary--$7.8 million; 
   Cocoa And Cocoa Preparations--$15.2 million; 
   Preparations of Cereals, Flour, Starch Or Milk--$23.1 million; 
   Miscellaneous Edible Preparations--$17.1 million.  
   Listen to this one: Cotton. 
   Here I am struggling in South Carolina, the South, cotton--I am importing cotton from the People's Republic of China. I have a $12.3 million surplus in cotton, not carded but combed. 
   It would be unfair to talk, with this particular amendment, about the deficit and all of these things because we already have a deficit. We do have a plus balance of trade in wheat, corn, and rice. It is listed under cereals, is the way they list it at the Department of Agriculture. We have a plus balance  of trade in wheat, corn, and rice, and a plus balance of trade in soybeans. 
   That is why I made this amendment to read ``wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans.'' I wanted to start off, as in soybeans, I have a plus balance of trade of $288.1 million. So we are happy. 
   We have a plus balance of trade of wheat, corn, and rice of $39.6 million. 
   I am looking at that particular category and whereby 4 years ago we had a plus balance of $440.7 million, it is down to $39.6 million. It promises maybe next year to go to a deficit. 
   I have all the farm boys saying: Wait a minute, wait a minute, we have to export. We have to export agriculture, export agriculture. We are not exporting agriculture, on balance, to the Peoples' Republic of China. We have a deficit. We are importing it now. If this continues, we will definitely have a deficit, in the sense--let me tell you what this agreement calls for. We are trying to really improve the competitor. These are the kind of agreements we make when we send Barshefsky and that crowd abroad. 
   I read:  
   China and the United States agree to actively promote comprehensive cooperation in agriculture, in the field of high technology, and encourage research institutes and agricultural enterprises to collaborate in high-tech research and development.  
   Do not for a minute think the Chinese are not coming. They are going to come for those high-tech items, go to our agricultural colleges, go to our experimental development stations, and they are going to collaborate on all the high-tech research and development. Mostly, they will be taking; they are not giving any. 
   Reading further:  
   China and the United States agree enterprises should be urged to make investment in each country to produce and do business in high-tech agricultural products.  
   They will have to make investments in that country to produce and do business in high-tech agricultural products. They agree with the content provision in agriculture, and yet my colleagues say: Whoopee, this is a wonderful agreement. 
   I think I will be around here long enough for these farmers to go out of business. Watch them. That wheat, as I said, is going from 440 million in a 4-year period down to just 40 million bushels. 
   Reading further:  
   Review and technical assistance--the United States will review its technical assistance programs in China to consider ways to increase the efficacy of these programs. The United States will create special educational symposiums specific to China's needs in cooperation with the U.S. land grant universities for Chinese officials and producers.  
   Ambassador Barshefsky is a wonderful negotiator for the Chinese. She is agreeing to have special symposiums when we already have a deficit in agricultural trade. We have to set up a symposium to increase the deficit. 
   Continuing:  
   The United States will provide opportunities for young Chinese leaders to visit the U.S. farms, ranches, and universities to study management systems and production technologies. 
   The United States will arrange opportunities for the Chinese officials and business leaders to study U.S. marketing and distribution of agricultural products in China and the United States. 
   As a means to implement the principle of technological cooperation and exchange, China and the United States will implement specific projects listed below.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I will not take that long. 
   My distinguished colleague, the chairman of our Finance Committee is really is one of our outstanding Members. I have every respect for his leadership--but on this particular score, he talks about the great market we have and that this amendment would require the President to intervene to obtain a certain balance of trade. Not at all. What I am trying to do is avoid a deficit in the balance. 
   As they say, they are a great market. As long as the soybean association is right, as long as the wheat association is right, and the other 63-some-odd associations are right, you will never hear any more about this amendment. It will be dead on the books because nothing will have to be triggered. I am taking their word for it. 
   I know otherwise. I have been in the agricultural business. When you mention the American Farm Bureau, I almost have to laugh. They have to do with everything but with farming. It is an insurance company. They have many times come out against the interests of the farmer. 
   I have taken an agriculture case, on the dairy score, all the way to the Supreme Court. I learned that my dairy farmers put their milk out on the stoop, that on the first of the month it is picked up, and they don't learn for 30 days--or sometimes 2 months--whether that is going to be classed grade A, class I grade A, or whether it is going to be class III grade C. There is a tremendous difference in price. It is up to the processor to determine whether it is going to go into processing ice cream, cottage cheese, or whether it is going to be pasteurized and put on the stoop as class I grade A. 
   So the poor farmer keeps his mouth shut because he has to get along. In short, the farmer is in the hands of the processor and the distributor in most instances. That is why you have these organizations and Archer-Daniels-Midland, Cargill, everybody else. They can run around and easily get these resolutions. 
   But the hard, cold fact is, I am here for the wheat farmer, for the soybean farmer, for the corn farmer. All I am saying is, you are telling me I am going to be able to expand this wonderful market. Well, I am looking, and seeing it has contracted, and overall we have a deficit right now. 
   I know 3 1/2 million cannot outproduce 800 million. I know I am obligated under the agreement to bring the 800  million up to snuff with the 3 1/2 million. So I am saying: Wait a minute here. Let's not go pell-mell down the road and ruin the one great thing we have, and that is America's agriculture. You ruined the manufacturing. Now you want to ruin its agriculture. So that is why my amendment is here. 
   Oh, yes, there is one other point. China will gain access to the WTO. The distinguished Senator and I agree on that. But he thinks that, ipso facto, it opens the market. Japan, for 5 years has been a member of the WTO. Try to get some of these things into Japan. 
   For those who are solely unknowing, for those who have not studied the case, if you think being a member of the WTO opens markets, you are wrong. Japan is the best example, and China is going the same way. Since they have signed this agreement, and since Ambassador Barshefsky said we did not have to have any more technology transfers in order to do business, Qualcom and many others have learned otherwise since that testimony before the Finance Committee.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on amendment No. 4135, and I call up amendment No. 4137 on the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the dilemma we are in. We not only don't know what we are doing, we are causing great damage to the workers in America. We are all running around America saying: I am fighting for working families. Well, we are eliminating working families here on the floor of the Congress. 
   Over the past 6 years, Congress appropriated $5 billion to run the Export-Import Bank of the United States. It subsidizes companies that sell goods abroad. James A. Harmon, President and Chairman put it this way:  
   American workers have higher quality, better paying jobs, thanks to the Eximbank's financing.  
   But the numbers at the bank's five biggest beneficiaries--AT&T, Bechtel, Boeing, General Electric, and McDonnell Douglas, which is now a part of Boeing--tell another story. At these companies, which have accounted for about 40 percent of all loans, grants, and long-term guarantees in this decade, overall employment has fallen 38 percent. Almost 800,000 jobs have disappeared. We are taxing the American public to pay for the elimination of these fine jobs. 
   What does my amendment say: It says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to the requirements--and there are all kinds of requirements at Exim and OPIC--neither the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation can provide risk insurance after December 31 of this year unless the applicant certifies that it has one, not transferred advanced technology to the People's Republic of China or, two, has not moved any production facilities until after January 1, 2001, from the United States to the People's Republic. 
   I want to cut out the ``P'' from PNTR. I can see the lack of knowledge and certainly maybe sometimes the disregard, but to actually come in here and raise taxes to finance the Eximbank and OPIC to, in turn, finance the export of these jobs or the elimination of over 800,000 jobs, we have lost over a million manufacturing jobs in the last decade. There is no question about it. We are just going out of manufacturing entirely. We are going into making hamburgers and handling the laundry, and there are a few software folks buying the stock, making themselves some money, but even the software employee is part time. The construction worker today now has been put off as an independent contractor. He is not under health care. The department store workers are also either independent contractors or part time workers. We have taken and decimated the workforce. And they are wondering why there is malaise or anxiety. 
   Here is the President back in May:  
   Clinton asked rhetorically: ``So why are we having this debate, because people are anxiety ridden about the forces of globalization.''  
   They tell us we just don't understand the forces of globalization. 
   After that one, I have a cover article, I ask unanimous consent to print this article. It is very interesting, ``The Backlash Behind the Anxiety of Over Globalization,'' in Business Week, dated April 24.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That anxiety over globalization is real. The average American working in manufacturing is not part of this wonderful economy. On the contrary, they are on the edge of losing completely. Just look at the fact that 28,700 manufacturing jobs in the State of South Carolina have been lost since NAFTA. 
   Let me tell you what happens. They say: Reeducate. I go right to Onieta, simple plant, making T-shirts. We brought it to Andrews, South Carolina some 30-some years ago. At the time it closed, last year and re-located to Mexico, they had 487 employees, and the average age was 47 years of age--all loyal, wonderful, productive, everything. So let's do it Washington's way, reeducate. They sound like Mao Zedong--reeducate, get ready for global competition. So tomorrow morning we have the 487 workers out of a job. They are now reeducated and they are expert computer operators. 
   Are you going to hire a 47-year-old computer operator or a 21-year-old computer operator? You are not taking on the pension, the retirement cost. You are not taking on the health care cost of the 47-year-old. You are going to hire the 21-year-old. So even Washington's way, they are high and dry. Deadline, go to the town of Andrews and some other places such as that where they have closed down these plants. We have high employment in Greenville, Spartanburg, but go to Williamsburg, go to Marlboro, go to Barnwell and you will see what has been occurring. 
   So we traveled the State. We have worked for jobs. And don't let the Tom Donahue and the Chamber of Commerce, come up here and start telling me about jobs. I have to sort of make a record. He has gone from representing Main Street and jobs in America to the multinationals, money makers, who can make far more by transferring their production outside of the United States. 
   I have gotten every Chamber of Commerce award. Bobby Kennedy and I were the tin men back in 1954. I have gotten it from every county Chamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce, any Chamber of Commerce. But on account of this trade debate, Donahue had them endorse and finance my opponent the year before last. Then do you know what he did, January of last year, after I came back from reelection? He gave me the award. He sent me some good government award or American leadership in commerce. I told him to stick it. Come on. What is going on around here? The unmitigated gall. That crowd has left. 
   I know the Business Roundtable. I refereed the fight between Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges and Roger Blough, President of U.S. Steel and head of the Business Roundtable. Because when Secretary Hodges was appointed by President Jack Kennedy, there were 12 on both sides. It was all about the Business Roundtable. They did their manufacturers census and everything else and gave it to the Business Roundtable. The poor Secretary didn't even have control of his own office so he ran them out. 
   And we had to referee that fight and get some of them back in, but at least put the secretary in charge of his own office. But CEO's are arrogant. I know them. They are arrogantly greedy, and they could care less about the country. Jack Welch, the best of the best, says I am not going to add a supplier unless that supplier moves to Mexico. Read the Business Week. The head of Boeing said, ``I'm not an American company, I'm an international company.'' Caterpillar is saying it too. They take pride that they don't have a country. 
   Well, I happen to represent a country, and I am not going to take it sitting down. They ought to be embarrassed. I appreciate the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee being here now, but the way they have treated this debate in violation of the Pastore rule, and they bring on morning business and talk about every other subject, they could care less about this debate. The vote is fixed. So we don't learn anything. I can learn from my fellow Senators if I am mistaken or in error. Fine, let's learn and understand what the situation really is. My figures are the Government's figures--the Department of Commerce, the Department of Labor figures, Department of Agriculture statistics. 
   We are not doing well at all in our deficit balance of trade. I can tell you here and now, Strom and I are going to get by. We are not paying our bills. The distinguished Chair is going to have to pick up my bills because I am spending money the government does not have. Mr. President, it is wonderful and since we have a little time you might indulge me. They ought to understand that the Department of Treasury, under the law--I know they would like to avoid this discussion. The Fed hasn't paid the large August payment on the interest cost. It is going to run around $70 billion. As of 9/12/2000, the national debt is $5,684,118,446,519.63. At the beginning of the fiscal year, it was $5,656,270,901,615.43. So in round figures, the debt has increased around $28 billion. The debt has gone up already. We spent $28 billion more than we took in. We had wonderful receipts on personal income on April 15, and again in June for corporate. But even with those, we now have spent $28 billion more than we took in. We have a deficit and we have had a deficit since Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1968-1969. Yet they all talk surplus. 
   We don't have a federal surplus. We don't have a surplus in trade. We don't have a surplus in agricultural trade. We don't have a surplus in technology trade. Where are the surpluses? We have a surplus in campaign contributions. Maybe that is the name of the game. Forget about the country. Use the Government to reelect ourselves and promise those things that we don't have. That is the biggest campaign finance abuse--using the Government and the budget. We call something a surplus when we have a deficit, and we promise so much in tax cuts and spending and everything else. Then when it comes to this important subject, either we say nothing or we don't even debate it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time on the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, of course, our chairman, in opposition to the amendment, has said three Presidents have worked 13 years and found the best way to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base was this particular PNTR agreement. If that is the case, I am a happy man. I have my grave doubts because I have been around here and, as John Mitchell said years ago: Watch what we do, not what we say. 
   So I put in amendments with respect to the matter of jobs. They say it is going to create jobs. I say there is going to be a loss of jobs. On this particular score, since we lost 69,000 manufacturing jobs just last month, and the NAM, the group in charge of manufacturing, the private entity, says we have a $228 billion deficit in the balance of manufacturing trade, then I think what we ought to do is look at this thing very closely; certainly not finance it. 
   Companies say it is too much of a burden to report. Not at all. They have to just make a statement that they have not used the monies of exports to adulterate the cause; namely, instead of creating jobs in America, to lose the jobs. The same with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. 
   Obviously, people looking at the record wonder why we have gotten ourselves in such a situation. I have watched it over the years and participated, obviously, in it, again and again. What really has happened is much like in the early days before World War II, the Spanish war, where they had the fifth column. We have, in international trade, the fifth column in the United States. Let me tell you how it is comprised. 
   Yes, after World War II the United States had the only industry. We had the Marshall Plan. We sent over our technology, our expertise and, bless everybody, it has worked. Capitalism has defeated communism. And the tax is still to favor the investment overseas. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, was voted down earlier this year on an amendment to stop financing it. That is exactly what this amendment says: Just don't--Export-Import Bank, OPIC--finance your demise. 
   But at that particular time the manufacturers in America had all kinds of trouble traveling to the Far East and elsewhere. They didn't like it. Air travel was a burden. Now it is a pleasure. 
   What happened is that the banks who were financing, like Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, started making most of their money, as of 1973, outside the United States. They saw their opportunity for expansion in financial trade and obviously sponsored all these foreign policy associations--the Trilateral Commission and everything else. So the best and the brightest crowded in from the Ivy League into these particular entities. They started talking about free trade, free trade, the doctrine of comparative advantage--and it is 50 years later, all power to them--free trade when there is no such thing. The competition is not for profit. It is not free. It is controlled trade and the competition is for market share and, in essence, jobs. 
   The next thing you know, they started actually investing. I will never forget it. These countries, starting with Japan, began to invest in the United States. Back in the 1980s, we had the independent study about the Japanese contributions to Harvard University. The Japanese-financed academics had tremendous influence over the business model being taught in leading business schools. So they began to take over, and with their investments and contributions to the outstanding campuses of America--the next thing you know, we had everyone in America making profits from their investments, buying into the principle of lean manufacturing and lower costs. We had influence in the banks, we had the Trilateral Commission, we had the campuses, and before long we had 
   the retailers who made a profit, a bigger profit out of the imported articles than what they did on the American-produced article. 
   Then you had the retailers, the Trilateral Commission, the banks, the campuses, the consultants, and finally the lawyers. Ten years ago Pat Choate wrote in ``Agents of Influence,'' that Japan had 110 lawyers, paid way more than we were paying them here--the consummate salary of the House and Senate by way of pay. Japan was better represented in the United States than the people of America by their Congress. 
   You get all these lawyers who come in and move into the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce--the Main Street merchant is forgotten. As the distinguished farmers have to realize, the U.S. Farm Bureau is now an insurance company. They have lost the American farmer. We have a deficit in the balance of agriculture with the People's Republic of China. 
   With respect to wheat, corn, and soybeans, if we lose the positive balance of trade that we have now, and start to get a deficit, let the President simply report it to the Congress and renegotiate and see if we can get better terms. That is what is called for. Otherwise we are going to sell out agriculture. 
   Overall, the Department of Agriculture shows a deficit in the balance of trade, particularly in cotton. We actually import more cotton from the  People's Republic of China than we export. We have a deficit in the balance of trade with the People's Republic of China in cotton. 
   I can see it happening, going from 440 million dollars down to 39 million dollars in the last 4 years. It is diminishing rapidly. Obviously, 800 million farmers can do better than 3.5 million in America. We are committed under this agreement to make the 800 million just as productive as the 3.5 million. We have to bring them over here, put on the seminars, carry them through our experimental stations, show them our technology under this agreement. 
   Once they have a glut in agriculture, once they solve their transportation and distribution problems, we are going to be in the soup in this country. We do have the greatest agriculture in the entire world, but trying to maintain it with the Export-Import Bank, the financing of our sales overseas, the research--we have the fifth column working against us. We are financing our own demise. 
   The fix is in on all of these votes. They will not even debate them. The legacy of President William Jefferson Clinton is one of fear. I just finished reading a book by David Kennedy, ``Freedom from Fear,'' about Roosevelt, about his leadership. It was true leadership. It was not taking the popular side of a public poll. On the contrary, he was always climbing uphill, all during the thirties and early part of the forties at the beginning of the war. He was fighting to get his policies and programs through. They were not popular ones at all. He led. He said: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. That was his legacy, freedom from fear. 
   Now we have global anxiety that President Clinton talked about--the fear of the worker and the farmer in America. They do not know how long they will be able to continue to produce, how long they will have a job, how long they will have a family, how long they will have financial security. 
   My amendments are not against China. They are against the United States and its failure to compete in international trade. Congress has the fundamental responsibility--article I, section 8 of the Constitution--the Congress, not the President, not the Special Trade Representative, but the Congress shall regulate foreign commerce. But we have been abandoning this responsibility. We do not debate it in the elections. We are now up to a $350 billion, almost a $400 billion deficit, costing us 1 percent of our GNP. 
   We are in bad shape, but nobody wants to talk about it. They just want to vote and get out of here. If my colleagues debate my amendments, I will be glad to show them the statistics I have corralled.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, at the present moment we have a $350 billion deficit in the balance of trade with the People's Republic of China, and it promises to increase. But proponents of the bill say: No, this is going to open the market in China for advanced technology. 
   At the moment, we do have a deficit in the balance of trade in advanced technology, according to the Department of Commerce, of $3.5 billion. So this amendment says, after January 1, from thereafter, if it exceeds $5 billion, that the President try to renegotiate and get better terms. This is only a request on behalf of the President. 
   This amendment ought to be adopted, really, by a voice vote. We can do away with the rollcall, if you want to.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want a rollcall on this one because it deals with agriculture. At the present time, surprisingly, we have a deficit in the balance of trade overall in agriculture with the People's Republic of China. We do have a plus balance of trade in wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans. We want to maintain that trade. We want to help that wheat farmer in Montana. 
   So this amendment simply says, if we get to a deficit in the balance of trade for America's farmers in wheat, corn, rice, or soybeans, that the President is requested to see if he can negotiate a better term. That is all the amendment calls for. 
   I am sure the farmers want a recorded vote on this one. They want us to show we are supporting America's agriculture.

James Harmon, president, stated that the principal beneficiaries under the Export-Import Bank had a 700,000 job loss or more during the past 10 years. What we are doing, in essence, is financing our own demise. So the amendment simply states that when you apply for this particular subsidy, you must certify that you haven't moved your manufacture overseas or that you haven't sent your advanced technology abroad. 
   Many of my colleagues have been trying to catch a plane. I wish they would take me with them. As a result, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the order for a rollcall vote.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, amongst all articles, you can see, generally speaking, China has a glut in agriculture. Their problem, of course, is transportation and distribution. But there is no question that once that problem is solved, that 7800 million farmers can certainly outproduce, if you please, the 3.5 million farmers in the United States. 
   All of the farm vote is in strong support of PNTR because they think, of course, it is going to enhance their agricultural trade. The fact is there are only a few here--the significant ones--and I have picked those out; cereals--wheat, corn, rice--and soybeans. Yes, there is a plus balance of trade in the cereals--wheat, corn, and rice--but it has gone from 440 million bushels down to 39 million bushels. With soybeans, it has gone from 366 million bushels, in the 4-year period, down to 288 million bushels. 
   So this particular amendment states that beginning on the first day of next year:  
   [T]he President shall report to the Congress on the balance of trade between the United States and the People's Republic of China in cereals (wheat, corn, and rice) and on the balance of trade between the United States and the People's Republic of China in soybeans for the previous year. 
   If the President reports a trade deficit in favor of the People's Republic of China.......for cereals or for soybeans, then the President is authorized and requested to initiate negotiations to obtain additional commitments from the People's Republic of China to reduce or eliminate the imbalance. 
   The President shall [also] report to the Congress the results of those negotiations........  
   In a line last week, I saw the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the conference in New York. He was all stirred and upset with respect to 1,000 cashmere jobs in the United Kingdom. He was really going to bat for them. The story had his picture politicking, trying to convince the United States in particular not to take retaliatory action against his 1,000 cashmere jobs. 
   Here I stand, having lost 38,700 textile jobs in the State of South Carolina since NAFTA--over 400,000 nationally. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, we are going out of business. And I can't get the attention of the White House and I can't get the attention of Congress. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for permitting me to have these amendments called up and printed, and then, of course, obviously set aside. Let me take my turn in behind the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from West Virginia. The Byrd amendment is up, and I think several others. I will take my turn. 
   But I want my colleagues to look at these reasonable, sensible, pleading kind of amendments so that we can fulfill, as a Congress, under the Constitution, article 1, section 8: The Congress of the United States shall regulate foreign commerce. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am reading the words of art here. That is why I have drawn this particular amendment because I thought there might be a question of germaneness. You cannot tell from reading without reference what exactly this amendment does. But in a line, it does away with the ``P'' of PNTR, the ``permanent'' normal trade relations, so that we can annually, as we have in the past, fulfill the obligation referred to by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who knows better than any our Constitution, article I, section 8. I almost have to demonstrate, like my forbearer, L. Mendel Rivers, the distinguished Congressman from Charleston, SC, who used to head up  Armed Services. He would bring up the Secretary of Defense. He would say, Robert Strange McNamara, not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress shall raise and support armies. 
   Similarly, not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress, under article I, section 8, shall regulate foreign commerce. Now word has it the ``Philistines'' got the fix on; we can't regulate anything. As the distinguished Senator pointed out in the previous debate on the amendment, there is no debate. They fix the Finance Committee, and once they--the leadership on both sides--get that, then they see how many votes they need and they wait until now to give us a little time, when we are about to leave for the Presidential campaign in another 3 weeks. You would think we would have a chance to debate and exchange ideas about the significance of a $350 billion to $400 billion trade deficit. But not at all. Nobody to listen or to exchange vows and no debate whatsoever. It is very unfortunate. 
   PNTR, to bring it right into focus--and the reason we submit this particular amendment has nothing to do with opening up China. They say with this agreement and with going into the World Trade Organization, we are going to open up China. Not at all. We have had an agreement with Japan, and Japan has been in the WTO for 5 years, and it has yet to open up the Japanese market. 
   PNTR has not a thing to do with jobs in America, either. My friend, the director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tom Donahue, says PNTR will create 800,000 jobs. I can show you we will lose at least 800,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. I will get that particular study later. 
   When they had the House vote and a headline in the Wall Street Journal, there was a footrace for investment in China. But it's not that we are going to start hiring more in America because we are going to have increased production and increased exports and increased jobs, not at all. 
   So it is not about exports whatsoever. We have a $70 billion deficit in our balance of trade with China, and I will bet you that it increases. Does anybody want to take on the bet? Name the amount, name the odds; the bet is on. 
   This deficit is going to increase with or without this particular amendment. And it has nothing to do with technology. We already have a $3.2 billion deficit in the balance of trade in high-tech with the People's Republic of China that will approximate $5 billion alone just this year. 
   It has really nothing to do with the environment and labor. I supported strongly the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. But, mind you me, it took us 200 years and more to get around to the environment, to get around to a safe working place and everything else of that kind. 
   It has nothing to do with human rights. The first human right is to feed 1.3 billion. The second human right is to house the 1.3 billion. The third human right is to educate. And the fourth human right, of course, is one man/one vote. Many here in the Congress have been touting one man/one vote. Without education, you have total chaos. As a result, you are not going to have a PNTR agreement that will improve human rights. They have used traumatic control. We oppose that; we don't like it. But run a country of 1.3 billion and let demonstrations get out of hand, and you have total chaos and no progress or improvement. 
   So it is really not about undermining the Communist regime. I have heard that on the floor. On the contrary. The Communist regime is unanimously in favor of PNTR. They know what they are doing. We don't know what we are doing. It is not about China obeying its agreements, it is about the United States enforcing ours. 
   I don't know where the fanciful thought has come from that somehow we have to continue like this, after 50 years of almost losing our entire manufacturing capacity, whereas Japan--a little country of 126 million--takes on 280 million Americans and almost outmanufactures and outproduces the United States of America. We are losing our economic strength. We are losing our middle class that is the backbone of that economic strength. ``The strength of 
   a democracy is its middle class,'' said Aristotle. We put in yesterday a particular article from Fortune magazine about the disparity between the rich and the poor and how the middle class is disappearing. 
   This has to do with the United States competing in international trade, the global economy. That is why I put up this amendment, so that we won't get it done in the year 2000. There is too great an interest in the Presidential campaign right now to really get anything accomplished on this important issue. Neither Presidential candidate has really addressed the subject of our trade deficit. They just say it in a Pavlovian fashion: ``I am for free trade.'' Well, free trade is an oxymoron. Trade is something for something. We know it is not free. Otherwise, of course, they hope to have trade without restrictions, without tariffs, without nontariff barriers, and those kinds of things. 
   As the father of our country said, the way to maintain the peace is to prepare for war. And the way to maintain free trade, rather than preparing for war, is to prepare for the trade war. It means in a sense to begin to compete, raise a barrier, and remove a barrier in China. 
   Jiang Zemin or Zhu Rongji should run for President. They know how to run the trade policy. They use that rich market of 1.3 billion and say: You can't come in here and sell that Boeing airplane, that 777, unless you make half of it in downtown Shanghai. You can't come in here with that automobile, that Buick, unless you put your research center here in Shanghai. They just told Qualcomm--although Trade Representative Barshefsky said we solved this problem--that there will be no more technology transfers. Hogwash. Tell them to call Qualcomm. They found out they couldn't sell there unless they shared the technology to the Chinese. 
   So business is business; it is not the Boy Scouts and it doesn't adhere to the golden rule. Incidentally, it is not for profits in the international competition. The global competition is for market share and for jobs. We are losing out in every particular turn. 
   So since I am a little bit limited in time here this afternoon, I want to correct the Record. I know the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee will enjoy this, because I could quote myself. 
   We did this research 15 years ago. We were tired of hearing about Smoot-Hawley, and that the hobgoblins were coming. They really went around yelling ``peril,'' and the Chinese, how we discriminated against them. Then the talk was that Smoot-Hawley would cause a world war; if you do not vote for this we are going to have World War III. I never heard of such nonsense. It is time we jailed that buzzard, Smoot-Hawley. Unfortunately, Ross Perot didn't understand Smoot-Hawley.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the distinction of working with this tremendous public servant, a brilliant fellow with the best personality. We all loved him. I worked with him on the budget. We even got Sec. 13.301, regarding a lockbox. We already have written in law that you are not to include Social Security in your budget. It is supposed to be in a trust fund. It was signed into law on November 5, 1990, by George Herbert Walker Bush. But they all say: Now I have a lockbox bill. They voted--98 Senators, Senator Heinz, and myself included, back at that particular time. But they don't obey it. 
   I think the most brilliant of Senators--I have been around 34 years--is our distinguished colleague, the ranking member, PATRICK MOYNIHAN of New York. Sen. MOYNIHAN wrote a very scholarly bill. I don't disparage at all. I lost a lot of valuables during a fire at my home. One was a collection of his books, which has now been replaced. He is a brilliant author, a most interesting writer, and a tremendous authority. But on this particular score, he is incorrect. The outcome of this vote won't threaten any world war, or anything else like that. 
   It is very important to realize that the crash came in October 1929, and Smoot-Hawley did not occur until June of 1930--8 months after the crash. And furthermore, back in 1929 and 1930, international trade to the United States economy was only 1.5 percent of the GNP. So Smoot-Hawley could not have caused the crash, which has been contended on the floor of the Senate. 
   And, No. 2, it had no far-reaching effects. In fact, it was hardly mentioned by either President Hoover, or then-candidate Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or President Roosevelt after he took office because there were other things to be disturbed about. The adverse effects of Smoot-Hawley paled in comparison to the problems facing the United States at that time. 
   I quote:  
   The conclusion appears inescapable on the basis of these numbers; a potential adverse impact of $231 million spread over the great array of imported products which were dutiable in 1929 could not realistically have any measurable impact on America's trading partners.  
   $231 million--here we are talking about a $350 billion to a $400 billion deficit. This is the overall trade figure of $231 million. 
   I read further:  
   Meanwhile, the gross national product (GNP) in the United States had dropped an unprecedented 13.5 percent in 1930 alone, from $103.4 billion in 1929 to $89 billion by the end of 1930. It is unrealistic to expect that a shift in U.S. international imports of just 0.2 percent of U.S. GNP in 1930 for example ($231 million on $14.4 billion) could be viewed as establishing a ``precedent'' for America's trading partners to follow, or represented a ``model'' to follow. 
   Even more to the point an impact of just 0.2 percent could not reasonably be expected to have any measurable effect on the economic health of America's trading partners.  
   I read and skip over because it is too long under the limited time to read the report in its entirety. But I quote this part.  
   1. The international trading system of the twenties bears no relation to the interdependent world of the eighties commercially, industrially and financially in size or complexity. 
   2. No effective international organization existed, similar to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for example for resolution of disputes. There were no trade ``leaders'' among the world's nations in part because most mercantile nations felt more comfortable without dispute settlement bodies. 
   3. Except for a few critical products foreign trade was not generally viewed in the ``economy-critical'' context as currently in the  U.S. as indicated earlier neither President Hoover nor President Roosevelt viewed foreign trade as crucial to the economy in general or recovery in particular. 
   4. U.S. foreign trade was relatively an amorphous phenomenon quite unlike the highly structured system of the eighties; characterized largely then by ``Caveat Emptor'' and a broadly laissez-faire philosophy generally unacceptable presently.  
   That brings it into sharp focus, because you have heard again and again that Smoot-Hawley started a trade war, that collapsed economies brought on the Depression and started World War II. They say if we don't vote for PNTR, it will cause World War III. They are bringing out all of these bogeymen. There is no merit in this. 
   Again, the Constitution, article I, section 8, says the Congress shall regulate and control foreign trade. 
   We are listening to the White House and the fix that is on, and they said, permanently abandon, amend the Constitution if you please, disregard this fundamental, and let us handle it because the White House father knows best. They bring out that white tent, and they all run around. They are mostly your friends, Senator ROTH. You know them well. And they are for profits. They don't have a country. 
   Listen to what Boeing says: I am not an American corporation, I am an international company. 
   Listen to the chairman of the board of Caterpillar: I am an international corporation. 
   They are companies without any country. They could care less about you, and I have to give every care. You and I are responsible for the regulation of foreign trade, and we ought not vote against it this afternoon by voting down this amendment on the premise of no amendments, no amendments, no amendments. If we have amendments, the House would then have a chance to look at it and realize that permanent trade relations with China abrogates the responsibility of Congress under the Constitution. 
   Reading on, there are a couple more quotes in the limited time. 
   In the concluding comments by Senator Heinz at that time:  
   The attempt to assign responsibility to the U.S. in the thirties for passing the Smoot/Hawley Tariff Act and thus set off a chain reaction of international depression and war is, on the basis of a preponderance of fact, a serious misreading of history, a repeal of the basic concept of cause and effect and a disregard for the principle of proportion of numbers. 
   It may constitute a fascinating theory for political mischief-making but it is a cruel hoax on all of those responsible for developing new and imaginative measures designed to liberalize international trade. 
   Such constructive development and growth is severely impeded by perpetuating what is no more than a symbolic economic myth. 
   Nothing is less worthwhile than attempting to rewrite history, not learning from it. Nothing is more worthwhile than making careful and perceptive and objective analysis in the hope it may lead to an improved and liberalized international trading system.  
   Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said that 15 years ago, almost to the day, September 1985. Those observations that our distinguished colleague made are just as true today. 
   Under the Constitution there is a fundamental responsibility that Congress regulates foreign commerce, but the Finance Committee and the administration with its fixed votes says: No, give it up. When I say ``fixed votes,'' I wish I had the New York Times article. I wish I had the Washington Post article. There were followup articles to the vote on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, and in that, distinguished Chairman ROTH, it was revealed that they gave our friend, Jake Pickle, a cultural center, they gave another Congressman two C-17s, and another a round of golf in California with the President--just to get their vote. They went around to fix, nothing to do with trade, and once the fix is on, you come out on the floor and say: Vote if you please to abandon your constitutional responsibility. 
   My amendment says: No, let's have trade with China. That is obviously going to occur. We live in the real world. These embargoes don't work. Forget about the embargoes. You cannot stop trade and grind the economy to a halt, the world economy to a halt, as they alleged Smoot-Hawley did. It will never happen. 
   It is not about starting a trade war and having an embargo. It is about enforcing our dumping laws--we could start by consolidating the enforcement efforts--and realizing that the industrial worker of the United States of America is the most competitive in the world. The thing that is not competing is the Congress of the United States. 
   We are about to vote. They say this amendment, too, will be voted down. We are about to vote down our responsibility to one of the most important issues that possibly could confront us. Alan Greenspan says the only bad effect on the economy is the $350 billion trade deficit. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to yield time to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma or I will ask unanimous consent that he be permitted such time as is necessary. He wanted to speak on this. I did not realize that. I want to have a few minutes left. 
   I want to comment on the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Montana. All these wonderful benefits--he has not read the GAO report. Everything is indeterminate. This is the most flexible agreement ever made. We made one with Japan and we have not penetrated that market. We made one with Korea and we have not penetrated that one, either. 
   All these benefits--I do not know if a $68 billion deficit is a benefit. Heavens above, we have to stop this somehow. Paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln: We have to think anew, act anew, and work together, we might get a plus balance of trade. 
   The distinguished Senator is saying if you vote for this amendment, you are violating article 1 of the WTO. I say if you vote against it, you are violating article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, abdicating our responsibility to regulate foreign commerce. We cannot make an agreement with the WTO to disband and dispel that particular obligation and responsibility. 
   I do not understand that at all. That is a narrow analysis if I ever saw one, that somehow the WTO is a wonderful thing. In fact, we are getting all kinds of requests to get out of it on account of the foreign credit sales given American corporations in their exports overseas. I will get into that later on, perhaps next week. 
   We have received a number of those requests. We are losing, I say to the distinguished Senator. The only reason for this amendment is to say: Wait a minute, let's have trade with China; go ahead with the WTO. Let's just take the ``P'' out of PNTR. The Senator from Montana said on the floor and Senator MOYNIHAN said on the floor, irrespective of this bill, China will become a member of the WTO--and we are a member of the WTO, so why are they so worried about this amendment? 
   We are not violating anything by voting for this amendment, but my colleagues will violate article I, section 8 of the Constitution and our responsibilities under the Constitution if they vote against it. 
   I have used the remaining time I had, I believe. I thank the distinguished Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Ken Lipper, the CEO of Lipper & Company investment firm, is a man of many talents. Ken is a novelist, a film producer and one of the most profound thinkers with respect to the new economy. In a February speech at the University of California Technology Conference, he outlined the strategies we must employ to address today's economic problems. Although he delivered the speech seven months ago, it is still valid. I ask that the text of the speech be printed in the RECORD. 
   The text of the speech follows. 
   Remarks of Ken Lipper 
   As of February 2000, the United States is in the 107th month of an economic boom, the longest in history. Even as this economic expansion continues, observers have been amazed that inflation remains a low 2.5 percent. Ordinarily, at the stage of ``full employment'' we are now enjoying--unemployment is at 4 percent, and is projected at 3.8 percent for the year 2000, with nearly 90 percent capacity utilization--there would be serious labor shortages and rising prices. As a result, the Federal Reserve would intervene to raise interest rates and tighten the money supply, causing the expansion to fizzle. 
   Why is this boom different? Currently there is an excess world capacity in basic manufacturing of goods and commodities, due in part to the Asian collapse combined with high unemployment and relatively slow growth in Europe. More important is the unprecedented and uninterrupted level of U.S. capital investment. Productivity has been increasing at historically high levels, an average of 2.5 percent each year, so that with a 3.2 percent annual wage increase, there is a real standard of living increase for workers without significantly increasing unit labor costs. 
   In addition, the amount and efficiency of capital behind each worker has increased. For example, in 2000, manufacturers expect to increase revenues 7.7 percent with only a 0.5 percent increase in their labor force; non-manufacturing sectors will increase revenues 6.9 percent with only a 1.4 percent labor force increase. These gains are possible thanks to a high level of investment in plant and equipment, which was up 21 percent in 1999 and is expected to rise another 15 percent in 2000. In non-manufacturing sectors, investment was up 4.7 percent in 1999 and expected to rise 8.7 percent in 2000. And this increased investment continues because a high consumer confidence level--now at an index of 144, compared to an average of 115--encourages corporations to expect growth in consumption. 
   Another factor keeping inflation low is heightened competition, both domestic and, thanks to free trade, foreign. The strong dollar magnifies the effect of this competition, translating into cheaper prices for imported goods. And buyers can also now compare prices by B-B commerce. As a result, 81 percent of manufacturers and 67 percent of non-manufacturers report that they cannot pass along price increases to consumers. At the same time, low interest rates worldwide and the buoyant U.S. stock market have made for cheap capital availability, enabling the investments in productivity. The strong dollar and stock market have made up for the low U.S. savings rate--among the lowest in the world--by encouraging record levels of foreign investment, year in, year out. 
   Finally, the cost of investment capital has been held down because the U.S. government budget surplus takes the U.S. out of the bond market as an issuer competitive with businesses; indeed, the U.S. is now buying back old bonds and liquefying the market. U.S. and European municipalities are also borrowing much less worldwide. These trends force investment funds to be reallocated to the private sector, lowering the cost of capital. 
   These are the reasons why some people feel that the old economic paradigm the boom-to-bust cycle, is outmoded. But we have not repealed the business cycle; we have only added significant time to the boom equation. Ultimately, the laws of supply and demand will still have their impact. 
   The risks to our economy are apparent, and rising. The Asian economies are recovering. In Europe, unemployment is falling and the pace of economic growth is rising, while the Euro is beginning to take hold and compete for funds. This means that over time there could be no cheap imports to hold down inflation. These factors have expressed themselves already, in conjunction with rocketing U.S. consumption, huge oil price increases, an end to the decline in raw materials prices, and rising intermediate-product prices. And these pressures occur as a dwindling supply of new entrants to the U.S. labor force will begin to push up wages. 
   Aggregate U.S. profit margins decreased in 1999, because companies lacked pricing power. But as Asian and European economic recoveries absorb excess worldwide capacity, corporations will regain their pricing power to restore profit margins and pass on increasing costs. 
   The Federal Reserve is already intervening, and will continue to raise interest rates. Many have asked why these interventions are necessary when there is no current sign of rising inflation. One reason is that the Fed's actions generally take about 18 months to filter through the economy. But there are other justifications. 
   The first is labor. We have seen how labor has been able to get real standard of living increases without large wage increases, due to low inflation. But if labor anticipates inflation from the causes discussed above, it will build protective wage increases into multi-year settlements, in order to hedge its potential loss of buying power. This would accelerate the wage-price spiral that itself fuels further inflation. Thus the Federal Reserve is signaling labor of its determination to fight inflation. 
   Second, the Fed is also signaling Congress not to cut taxes or increase programs using the budget surplus, thus putting further pressure on available resources. The Fed's moves seem to indicate that it wants the national debt repaid and Social Security and Medicare funded. 
   Third, the Fed wants to dampen consumption due to the ``wealth effect,'' the stock market gains which are responsible for about 25 percent of the growth in U.S. GDP. Currently, over 50 percent of American households own stocks, with increasing numbers borrowing to carry them. People are spending based on presumed wealth from the stock market, a major difference from the time when consumption was directly linked to more predictable earned income. 
   Nobody knows how fast or how steep a fall in the stock market might be, given high debt levels, but consumption would certainly be affected. When the Japanese bubble burst, the stock market never recovered from its 50 percent loss, and no government program has succeeded in reviving the shocked Japanese consumer. 
   Fourth is the housing market. I expect housing starts to decline by 6 to 8 percent in the second half of 2000 due to rising mortgage rates, which will also affect existing housing prices. At a time of historically minuscule savings rates, how will the stock market investor and consumer react when both his storehouses of wealth--stock and homes--start to fall? 
   I expect that stock prices will recover during the first quarter and perhaps the first half of 2000, as profits reflect the high productivity investments already made and consumption continues unabated. But the risks touched on above will become increasingly evident, and the second half should begin to anticipate and express them in declining stock prices in the U.S. And the Federal Reserve will continue to increase interest rates. 
   Nobody can reliably predict when a stock boom will end. But this one seems to operate in an atmosphere of growing threat, and from lofty heights. NASDAQ has an unprecedented 178X multiple, which might be justified for a few companies but cannot be sustained for an aggregate, 4,700 entities. So how will it end? 
   Probably very suddenly, as other bubbles have burst; and they often take years to recover. On May 4, 1990, Christie's Evening  Auction failed to attract bids; art prices tumbled 50 percent and the market evaporated. The price of gold reached a peak of 665 in September 1980; in January 1981 it was at 505; in March 1982 it had fallen to 320. The stock market plunged from a peak of 2650 in October 1987 to 1770 two months later. In Japan, the stockmarket collapsed from a peak of 39,000 in December 1989 to 21,000 in September 1990. And Russia defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt in August 1998, just two months after borrowing it. 
   What does this mean as a practical matter? Anyone who anticipates needing refinancing should do it sooner rather than later. Those who wish to liquidate some of their concentrated stock holdings should act now, to protect their future lifestyles. Corporate strategies that are based on a fast burn rate of cash, and that plan to get new money to reliquefy, should modify these plans to slow the burn rate in case refinancing is not easily available. And those who need refinancing should cultivate venture capital sources in Europe, where economic growth and an appetite for U.S. venture opportunities should provide a fertile alternative to a more subdued U.S. market. 
   Now I would like to turn from these dry ruminations on the economy to more value-oriented thoughts on building a business, based on my personal experiences as an entrepreneur. Creating an enterprise for nothing should be a reflection of your own values, fears, experiences, intellectual insights, and sense of what is important--becasue you, as the entrepreneur, must feel comfortable with running it. There is no single formula, but certain observations might prove applicable to your own situation. 
   Professor Bhide wrote in Harvard Business Review: ``Several principles are basic for successful start-ups: get operational fast *.*.* [and] don't try to hire the crack team. *.*.*'' These precepts are not supported by my own experience. The professor's recommendations place a huge premium on the exclusivity and value of an idea, and the notion that others could beat you out if you delay. These beliefs are responsible for a large number of helter-skelter business-launches-as-preemptive-strikes, premature introductions that fail due to poor product quality, weak delivery systems, inadequate customer support, or inadequate internal financial controls. 
   Every shoe-shine man will freely share his ideas with you. However, what counts is the implementation of an idea by a quality team of people. My products were carefully crafted and tested over two years, altered and risk-adjusted through examining results. A crack team was put together, with the first hire being Salomon's top accountant--because I wanted to know the limits of my dream before I acted beyond my resources, capacity, or risk profile. 
   Simply to the point: was it Prodigy's innovations, or Lotus's being first in the market, that won the software battle? Or was it Microsoft's better preparation for meeting and servicing customers' needs that won the day? You generally have one shot at the marketplace. And credibility depends on predictability. Make sure everything is carefully prepared in depth, no matter how long it takes, so that the product and its supports work as promised. Getting started is not the goal; permanency is! 
   Building many products and applications can be exciting in concept, but it is difficult in terms of financial and physical resources. I build my products narrowly and very deeply, so that we could equal any competitor in a specialty area. Editing out the many other opportunities is vital for concentrating resources and talent on the very few things that you can do best. Choose your product, refine it, and continuously monitor it based on experience. I chose specialty products that did not require muscularity of distribution, capital, and related support inputs, all of which favor existing large corporations. By developing a few intellectually rich products at the beginning, we weren't forced to compete head-on with the big boys, and therefore we could get profit margins and cash flow that provided fuel for further expansion. 
   I believe that many Internet retailers go into commodity-oriented businesses in which price is the key determinant, only to find that success means bigger losses and that old, dominant players can enter internet distribution at will and grab market share. Time is the most precious capital, so a business should only enter growing markets with a superior service or product, where decent profit margins are available over a long period of time. 
   It was my experience that becoming a brand name quickly is extraordinarily difficult. It requires a long period of exposure and in-depth, sustained advertising. Few newcomers have the necessary financial staying-power, so avoid spending money on ineffectual ads. If your business strategy requires you to promote the product enormously, then maybe it is the wrong product choice. Remember that it is easier for GM or Toys R Us to learn how to use the Internet than for you to gain their brand images. And, conversely, once the speculative fever recedes, why would anyone pay 9 times earnings for Macy's and 1,000 times revenues for a wannabe whose aspiration is to maybe become the Macy's of the Web? 
   It is also important not to gild the lily technologically. Think of the customer's technical competence and how he will actually use your product. My biggest recent error was listening to a tech analyst who told me not to buy AOL at $26 a pre-split share, because there were technically superior products. The mix between technology and user friendliness is vital. After all, do you use Betamax or VHS? 
   In building a business, it is crucial to put emphasis on becoming an institution. I found that it takes two years for a person to feel comfortable in a corporate culture, so it is better to build a team in anticipation of growth than in response to it. Invest early and heavily in support systems, in the areas of client service, electronic information, and financial controls. Let everyone know what is expected of him or her through clear communication, so that employees are moving in the direction of corporate goals. My company has never been star-oriented, in a star-studded industry. Good organization creates a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. 
   Relationships are key to success, and that means knowing the people in your arena. Biotech executives should know the important people in the FDA, the universities, and the pharmaceutical companies. And relationships should be maintained for the long term. Remember, credibility equals predictability; long relationships allow people to judge you based on past interactions. It's too late if you only meet people when you need them. 
   Personnel turnover is a significant problem today. The mantra everywhere is stock options, the chance to get rich quick. This leads to high turnover if a company has actual or perceived problems, or, on the other hand, if it is too successful and young people get rich quick. In my company, which is family owned, we have low turnover. We build loyalty in three important ways. First, all employees share in profits; we have a flatter compensation scheme than many technology companies. Second, there is justice in allocating rewards over long periods of time. Our people know that we have permanency; we give them a long-term horizon, with expectation of growing rewards over time. 
   Third, our people feel safe. There are no politics, few layoffs, and no acting out; people check their egos at the door. We breed loyalty through civility. People are trained and moved around the company to keep the interest level high, and promotions are made internally. The culture is kept strong by outsourcing and a small number of hires. And finally, there is a single decision-maker; everyone has input, but I make the final decision based on careful research and many individual inputs. There is no ranting or screaming by anyone; instead, there is a free flow of ideas, tentative acceptance, and thorough investigations, so that all communication moves back and forth. 
   A great business idea, or a great scientific idea, does not just come about through hard work and incremental advances. It is more like poetry. It is about having the imagination and heart to strike out on a path that others didn't dare to follow, or didn't see in its entirety. Implementation, management skills, and the ability to anticipate customer needs are built on a knowledge of how human beings react. These types of imagination and understanding are more likely to come from wellness than from frenzy. I don't subscribe to the continuous-all-nighters, no-personal-life recipe for success. For a super-successful entrepreneur, having broad horizon--through reading fiction and biography, appreciating art, and interacting socially with a variety of people--is more important than working yet another Sunday. 
   But there is more at stake than business success. You want to be a happy person, a good father, a community builder. I find that I can only eat one tuna-fish sandwich at lunch, no matter how many millions I have earned. Money can give you time, and how you spend that time is key. And wise expenditure of personal time on human development can also help you make money, because knowledge, experience, and wisdom are usually the key to the ``poetic'' business idea. 
   Young people are leaving college to make quick money, like a gold rush. But life is about more than money or success or technical achievement. It is critical that people see the world in vibrant colors and in multiple shades. To raise children, face the death of parents, appreciate beauty, even make love well, people need emotional and intellectual depth. These come from being exposed to the collective experience of civilization, which is transmitted through books and a liberal education. 
   In the scheme of your success, it will not make a difference if you leave school two years early; but it could alter your life greatly. Absorb the intangibles, not just because they will give you the imagination to come up with ``poetic'' business ideas to help you deal with customers, but also because they will give meaning to the life you lead, whether you succeed materially or not. After all, living life well, in all its dimensions, is what it's all about.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, and to support the amendment to the bill. I urge my fellow Senators to adopt the amendment and to support passage of this bill. It, indeed, will make our Nation's pipeline system safer. 
   The purpose of the bill is to ensure the safety of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. I appreciate the considerable number of hours that went into creating this bill by all of the parties. I also am satisfied by the spirit of compromise that infused the parties' diligent efforts. As a result of their admirable and cooperative work we have a bill that reaffirms our efforts to regulate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines safely and effectively without interfering with the pipeline operators and owners ability to provide service to our Nation. 
   With respect to concerns regarding the existing pipeline safety program, I want to share my concerns about the delays in issuing Congressional mandates. Some may find it hard to believe that the Office of Pipeline Safety, OPS, has failed to issue final rules on measures that required rulemakings under its 1992 and 1996 reauthorizations. Unquestionably, the rules on environmentally sensitive and high density areas should have been completed by now. I have been advised that a final rule is expected this year. But even if this is the case, the fact remains that the final promulgation is still significantly behind schedule. The rules on operator qualification and periodic inspections are not final either. One of the goals of this legislation is to stimulate the finalization of these rules. 
   Over the past few years, we have experienced two major pipeline accidents, one in Bellingham, WA, and the other near Carlsbad, NM. While accidents happen, we need to take all necessary steps to ensure that accidents are not waiting to happen. I think that this legislation will increase the arsenal of tools available to OPS to ensure that our pipeline system is as safe as possible. I ask that OPS use the tools that we provide to ensure the aggressive oversight of pipeline safety practices. 
   While there were many who worked arduously to ensure passage of legislation in this area, I would like to recognize, in particular, the efforts of Senators MURRAY and BINGAMAN. Senator MURRAY doggedly pursued changes to increase the level of safety and public participation in pipeline safety, and she worked closely with other Commerce Committee members to ensure a reasonable and fair compromise. Senator BINGAMAN was instrumental in helping bolster the bills provisions on research and development. We also were able to add provisions he authored to focus our research on progressive areas that will help us develop better systems of early detection, and to ensure that we can avoid accidents such as those that occurred in Bellingham, WA, and near Carlsbad, NM. 
   This bill is good legislation. It will require our regulators to finalize a number of overdue regulations. The bill also allows for a greater degree of public participation in the process of pipeline safety, updates the penalties that would be levied for misconduct and provides whistle blower protection for employees who reveal misconduct. The bill also helps us focus on long-term needs so as to make our future pipeline system even safer. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues Mr. BROWNBACK and Mr. KERRY to make clear the intent of certain provisions in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. It has come to my attention that there may be some ambiguities contained in the language of Section 10(b) of the proposed legislation (S. 2438). As you are aware, Section 10(b) of the bill adds a new provision--Section 60117(b)(3)--to the Revised Pipeline Safety Act. This provision requires that, during the course of an incident investigation, a pipeline owner or operator make records, reports, and information relevant to the incident investigation available to the Secretary upon request within the time limits prescribed in a written request. The bill incorporates by reference this new section into both the civil and criminal penalties sections of the Act, Sections 60122(a) and 60123(a), respectively. Under the current proposal, failure to comply with this reporting provision can result in civil penalties of up to $500,000 for each violation and $1,000,000 for a related series of violations. And, a separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues. 
   Civil penalties are capped at a maximum of $500,000 per day and $1,000,000 for a ``related series of violations.'' The information required to be produced during an investigation pursuant to Section 60117(b)(3) is limited to information ``relevant to [a particular] incident investigation.'' I am seeking clarification that all information requests issued by the Secretary pursuant to a single incident investigation are considered ``related'' for purposes of calculating the $1,000,000 civil penalty cap for a ``related series of violations'' under Section 60122(a). In other words, the provision would not treat each written information request as a separate and unrelated event for purposes of applying the $1,000,000 cap so long as all of the requests concern the same incident. Were that not the case, a pipeline owner or operator that receives numerous document requests relating to an incident, but is unable to assemble and provide all of the information in time to meet the Secretary's deadline, could face fines far exceeding the $1,000,000 contemplated by this legislation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in making opening comments relative to permanent normal trade relations with China, I feel compelled to sort of qualify as a witness in that we have over the years in these particular debates about international trade made very little progress, whether with Democratic administrations or Republican administrations. 
   My rising in opposition and my amendments will be to the thrust of not having permanent and not having normal trade relations with anybody because our normal trade relations are a $350 billion to $400 billion trade deficit which is destroying the middle class in our society, weakening our democracy, and diminishing our influence in world affairs. With all of the pep talk about the wonderful economy, we are actually, on this particular score, in tremendous decline. 
   I say ``as a witness'' in a sense because I can remember when southern Governors started computing. People up in New Hampshire and other places say that they are from down south and that they are blind protectionists; they do not understand the importance of manufacturing and international trade and exports. So I hearken back to the day when I represented the northern textile industry from New Hampshire as well as the southern textile industry. I appeared before the old International Tariff Commission. Who ran me around the room? None other than Tom Dewey. This was back in 1960. The subject was textiles--that 10 percent of the American consumption of textiles in clothing was represented in imports, and if this continued at the pace that it was going, before long we would be out of business. 
   By the way, they told me at that particular hearing: Governor, what do you expect? For those emerging Third World countries in the Pacific rim and everywhere else, what do you expect them to make? Let them make the shoes and the clothing, and we will make the computers and the airplanes. 
   Fast forward 40 years: They are making the shoes. They are making the clothing. They are making the airplanes and they are making the computers. They are making all of it. Actually, we have high tech. I want to get into that in a minute. High tech--they think that is saving us. We have a deficit in the balance of trade with the People's Republic of China in high technology. 
   This Congress doesn't have any idea where we are on this particular score. Everybody is outside talking about the new economy. True it is, we are all proud of that new economy, particularly on this side of the aisle. They were afraid to say they raised the Social Security tax in 1993 when Clinton came into office. But I wasn't afraid. I brought it in line with all other pension plans. We are afraid to say we raised gasoline taxes. But we did. We cut spending $250 billion. The taxes that were supposed to be $250 billion are now up to $370 billion. Then we cut some taxes very minimally. We reduced the size of government by some 377,000 Federal employees. 
   They have the new economy. But the new economy has a private side and a public side. The private side is doing extremely well. High employment, low unemployment, low interest rates, booming economy, booming stock market, strong bank system--but the public side is almost a disaster. I say that advisedly. The reason I say it is so that, for one thing, they are talking surplus, surplus. Everywhere, someone cries ``surplus.'' 
   The public debt to the penny according to the U.S. Treasury Department shows that, as of September 1, the debt is $5.676 trillion. At the beginning of the fiscal year of September 30, 1999, it was $5.656 trillion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that shows that the debt has increased $20 billion--no surplus. They don't want to say where they get the surplus from. I can tell you where they get the surplus from. We had an increased measure of taxation over the years. When we had the 1983 Social Security settlement, we wanted it to increase to build up a trust fund to take care of the baby boomers in the next generation--which is now. In 1992, the Social Security surplus was $50 billion; now the Social Security surplus is $150 billion. 
   Over the last 8 years--because of what we did back in 1983--we have an additional $100 billion surplus, if you please, for the Social Security trust fund. We voted it here--section 13-301 of the Budget Act--that you shall not use Social Security surpluses in your budgets. Section 12 of the Greenspan commission said it should be set aside. It took us from 1983 until 1990 in order  to get that done, but we finally got it done. Ninety-eight Senators voted for it. Almost all the Members of the House voted for it. It was signed into law on November 5, 1990, by President George Bush. 
   But all of them are running around saying we are going to save Social Security while they are spending it with all kinds of monkeyshine plans--invest a little, invest a lot, do this, or do that to save Social Security. They set up the straw man in violation of the law--the policy of the Greenspan commission and talking about surpluses when there is not any surplus. The debt is increasing. If there is a surplus, why has the debt increased $20 billion? With all the wonderful income tax from which we had revenues on April 15, with all the good corporate tax revenues in June, we are still increasing the debt some $20 billion. 
   All of them say tax cut, tax cut, but if you cut the estate taxes, you have increased the debt. All tax cuts are increasing the debt. They are all saying pay down the debt, pay down the debt. It is Alice in Wonderland. It is double talk. They are not talking sense with relation to what is actually going on. 
   Everybody says we are paying down the debt. But they are for all of these taxes. Whether it is middle class, or targeted, or estate, or gasoline, or capital gains, or marriage penalty, any of those tax cuts under present circumstances obviously amount to an increase in debt. They talk about surplus that doesn't exist, and they talk about paying down the debt as they regularly increase it. They don't mention waste. 
   As a result of this charade, interest costs have gone up to $366 billion for this fiscal year. I remember when we balanced the budget in 1968 and 1969 under President Lyndon Johnson. The interest cost on the national debt was less than $1 trillion; the interest cost was only $16 billion. That was the cost of all the wars from the Revolution, to the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam. We had a debt of less than $1 trillion and they had interest costs of only $16 billion. Now we are up to $5.7 trillion, with $1 billion a day being spent. Wait until the whopping payment is made in September.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. It is $321 billion without the August and September payments. When we get those particular payments, it will go up, up, and away. And that is under low interest rate circumstances. 
   We have the worst waste of all. I served on the Grace Commission under President Reagan. We were going to cut out waste, fraud, and abuse. Now we have caused the greatest waste of all. 
   After President Clinton early this year made the State of the Union Address, the comment was made by the distinguished majority leader that it was costing $1 billion a minute. The President talked for 90 minutes; that is $90 billion. Governor Bush wants to give a $90 billion tax cut. We could give President Clinton $90 billion in spending. We could give Governor Bush $90 billion in tax cuts and still have $170 billion left for all the increases to the Department of Health, for class size reduction and school construction and any and every kind of research at NIH that we wanted. 
   The point is, we are spending the money and we are not getting anything for it and we don't talk about it on the campaign trail. What do they avoid talking about? The $350 to $400 billion--and it will probably be nearly $400 billion--deficit in the balance of trade. The economists say that costs us at least 1 percent on our GNP. Instead of 4.1, we would have 5.1, and more jobs. 
   This is ignoring the failure of the United States to compete in international trade. I emphasize that for a reason, for those who say we are blind protectionists, that we don't understand the global economy, the global competition and do not want to compete and want to start a trade war. No. 1, we have been in a trade war and we have been losing. They don't understand that. No. 2, on globalization, I don't want to sound like the Vice President, but I helped invent it 40 years ago. I went as a young Governor to Europe. I have that Deutsche Telekom bill that they talked about in the paper the other day. The truth is, I called on the Germans in Frankfurt. Today we have 116 German industries in the little State of South Carolina. I will never forget calling on Michelin in downtown Paris in June of 1960 with 11,600 Michelin employees. We have Hoffman-LaRoche from Switzerland. And Honda broke ground a few years ago. I was amazed to hear that Honda produced and exported more vehicles than General Motors. 
   I have been in public service 50 years. I have been debating this issue in all five textile bills that passed here. Four of them passed the House also and were vetoed by Presidents over the years. When we come to trade and globalization, I think it behooves me not to talk about permanent, not to talk about normal, but use this opportunity to sober up the Congress and the leadership of the United States, making them realize that we are in a real competition, but not for profit. That is, the American multinational. They could care less. They don't have a country. Boeing came out the other day and said in the United States, we are not a U.S. company but an international company. Caterpillar has been holding in Illinois. But they were international. They think it is fine. The Chamber of Commerce has forgotten about Main Street America and gone with the multinationals. NAM and the Business Roundtable--we are in the hands of the Philistines. We are losing our manufacturing base because we don't understand that the global competition is not for profit but for jobs and market share. 
   Let me talk a minute about jobs. At the fall of the wall, 4 billion workers came from behind the Iron Curtain, ready to work for anything, anywhere, at any time. In the last 10 years, with computerization and satellites, you can transfer your technology on a computer chip, you can transfer your financing by satellite. You can produce anything anywhere that you please. That is the global competition and international trade. 
   While our American producers for the so-called profit want to manufacture, say, in the People's Republic of China, for 10 percent of the labor costs than it is paying in the United States, we have been losing, losing, losing. In manufacturing, they say 30 percent of volume is in the cost of labor. Or you can save 20 percent of your volume by moving the manufacturer of your product offshore or down to Mexico. Simply put, you can maintain your executive and your sales force here but put your manufacturing elsewhere. If you have $500 million in sales, at 20 percent, before taxes, you can save $100 million. 
   Or you can continue to work your own people and go broke because your competition  is headed that way. That is the job policy of the U.S. Congress today. It is to accelerate the exodus and the export of jobs. 
   I will never forget when they told us that NAFTA was going to create 200,000 jobs. I just looked at the figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is more than just that 38,700 figure, but in textiles alone we have lost 38,700 jobs since NAFTA; in North Carolina, 90,000. I will never forget when they came down to Charlotte and said they wanted to talk about the digital divide. They are the ones dividing it. You think if you lost a job you are going out and buying a $2,000 or $3,000 computer? ``It's the economy, stupid.'' That is where we are. You just can't understand we are here, when they think it is a productivity thing on jobs: Productivity, productivity, productivity--We have global competition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. You begin to understand--when we talk about jobs, when we talk about pay, when we talk about our society, when we talk about our economic strength, when we talk about the middle class--that the strength of our democracy is disappearing. 
   So, yes, we are going to trade with China. But if you make it permanent  and you make it normal and you want to compete with China, you are going to be in one heck of a fix, is all I have to say. 
   Let me say a word about market share. Japan has been practicing this for a long time. They have a society that sacrifices at the home market in order to take on the international market, the market of the United States. There is no question about it. 
   That Lexus that costs $34,000 in the United States costs $40,000 to $44,000 in downtown Tokyo. That camera that sells for $300 here--a Japanese camera--sells for $600 to $1,000 in downtown Tokyo. That Handycam that sells for $640 in the United States--made in Japan--sells for almost $2,000 in downtown Tokyo. 
   We do not have that kind of society. This is a spoiled society. We are supposed to give you tax cuts even though we have hardly any taxes to cut. And they can't be punitive, because look at the economy. By the way, we are paying down the debt, but we do not tell them we are increasing the debt at the same time. 
   I really have not had but one person ask me about the estate tax. Nobody has asked me about the Social Security tax because we put it in line with all other pension plans. Nobody has bothered about gasoline. Overseas, they regularly sacrifice $4.20 for a gallon of gas. When we get to $2 a gallon, we go ape and hold Federal investigations, TV shows, and everything else. 
   So the competition in globalization is one of sacrifice. In China, they call it communism; sacrifice, in Japan, in Korea, and even in France and Germany. They have all kinds of rules and regulations. Try to buy a year 2000 Toyota in France. They keep it at the Port of Le Havre and inspect it a year or so, and you can buy the year 2000 model on January 1, 2001. 
   They have all kinds of barriers and different tricks. We talk about globalization and productivity as if we know something about it and that all we have to do is reeducate and get more engineering graduates. Come on. 
   I am talking about middle America, the blood and guts of this society, the blood and guts of this democracy. That is what keeps us a strong country. That Fortune magazine article that came out the day before yesterday will tell you about that divide, will tell you that the take-home pay of that industrial worker is less than what it was 20 years ago, adjusted for inflation. It is a devil of a trend, but they are not talking about that or even mentioning trade. But when it comes to market share, the Japanese set the pace. 
   What is going on in telecommunications? 
   I have a bill which is a reminder because the law is there. I am going to testify tomorrow that it is nothing more than a reminder. No communications bill is going to pass unless they put it as a rider on one of these appropriations bills. Because they do not want to debate these things. 
   All you have to do is look at Deutsche Telekom's SEC reports and know they call themselves a monopoly and that the German government is in control. 
   When you are a country in control, you can print money. We know that better than anybody. We have been running deficits since 1968, 1969 under Lyndon Johnson; now the debt is $5.7 trillion. So we know about governments printing money. 
   Deutsche Telekom had its stock at $100 earlier this year, in March. Now it is down to $40. Do you think Ron Sommer, the CEO of Deutsche Telekom, is worried? He could care less. He says: I have $100 billion. 
   He just had a bond issue of $14 billion. Everybody got into it. We could not get a $14 billion bond issue going in this country. But a government-controlled company can easily get it because that company can't go broke. It is bound to win. 
   Sommer says: I have $100 billion. And I am ready to buy AT&T or MCI or Sprint or VoiceStream or any telecom company I please. If his stock was down in the regular market to $40, and he had $100 billion, there would be a footrace between Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn. They would be in there in a flash. There would have been a takeover long ago. You see, they can come in with all kinds of capital and distort the competitive market. 
   That is why we deregulated telecommunications from U.S. Government control in 1996. We certainly did not do it to put it under German Government control. That is why we have the World Trade Organization, in order to get competition, not to set up government-controlled companies to take over in the private market. 
   But why do they do that? Who does offer the highest price, they tell me, per subscriber in one of these communications entities. Previously the highest bid was $12,000 per subscriber. Deutsche Telekom comes in with $21,000 to $22,000. Money is nothing to them. Why? Because they want market share. They battle. And the whole fight in globalization is for either jobs on the one hand, market share on the other hand, or both. 
   That is the globalization. That is the trade. And we do not have a trade policy. 
   They talk about free trade, and they get together. Unfortunately, our Democratic leadership gets together with the Republican leadership on this score. 
   They put out the white tent and they fixed the vote. The New York Times wrote the article about it. The New York Times put in there that they got the NAFTA vote by giving our friend, Jake Pickle, a culture center; another Congressman two C-17s; another one a golf match. They had 26 gimmies to fix the vote. So they fixed the vote here in the Finance Committee and fixed the vote with the leadership, and they have the unmitigated gall to come and say: No amendments, don't discuss it, when can we vote, let's get this thing over with, free trade, free trade, free trade. 
   I am going to join my friend, our leader from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, and others, and hope we bring some sobriety to this crowd up here in Washington. Let's start competing and let's start being productive. Congress berates the U.S. industrial worker. You must become productive. But we can't pass an increase in the minimum wage. We can't pass a patients' bill of rights. We can't pass gun control. We can't pass campaign finance. We can't do anything. 
   Remember, we are competing with ourselves. I think that is one of the main points to be understood. I will never forget those industrialists who traveled all the way to Europe and back with jet lag to implement the Marshall Plan. Now with the profit the corporations make, they don't mind the jet lag. They don't mind moving for a while to Japan and Korea and other places. And as of 1973, the banks--Citicorp and Chase Manhattan--made a majority of their revenues and profits outside of the United States. They became more or less multinational. Then, of course, the corporations themselves started traveling over there and they organized in order to support this so-called free trade, which they knew historically was a bummer. They organized the Trilateral Commission and the Foreign Policy Association. If you run for President, the first thing you do is get a gilded invitation to go up and pledge on the altar of almighty free trade your loyalty and your fealty to free trade. So you become sophisticated. You become knowledgeable. Yet you don't know what you are talking about. 
   Then they give the contributions to the college campuses so that you not only have the companies and the banks, but you have the campuses. There was a Ms. Jacobson who put out a study back in the 1980s where the majority of the contributions, I think, on the Harvard campus were Japanese. So you get all the campuses. You get the consultants. You get the Washington lawyers. We don't hear too much from our friend Pat Choate. I wish he would run again. Pat Choate wrote ``The Agents of Influence.'' 
   The agents of affluence were our special Trade Representatives, whether it was Eberly or Brock or Strauss, those representing us immediately went to represent the other side. It would be like General Powell going to represent Saddam Hussein and Iraq. But that is what has been going on. To Mickey Kantor's credit, he has not done that. But I have been here long enough to watch all of them. Carla Hills, who gets all of these awards and everything else, represented the other side, the competition. 
   Then you have the retailers. We used to debate a bill, Mr. President. I would go down to Bloomingdale's, and I would get a lady's blouse made in Taiwan and  one made in New Jersey because they are trying to fill up the order. They were never the same price, and the American manufacturer wasn't the lower price. I went to Herman's and got a catcher's mitt, one made in Michigan, one made in Korea--the same thing, the one from Korea was cheaper. So they make a bigger profit, the retailers. And the retailers pay the newspapers through advertisements. That is the source of the majority of newspapers' profits. The business manager of that newspaper says you have to be for free trade because the retailers are their clientele. 
   I just heard the distinguished Senator from Arkansas talk about free trade. She was very much for this particular bill. Their biggest industry? Wal-Mart, import industry. They are going 
   to sell a few chickens in Arkansas. Tyson hopes he can sell a few chickens. But they are not producing anything else there. So we have to go over to the retailers. 
   We have the banks, the corporations, the consultants, the societies, the campuses, the lawyers, special trade representatives and, yes, the lawyers. The Commerce Committee does not consider a bill that your office does not fill up with this crowd. In fact, these folks are confusing the Deutsche Telekom bill that my distinguished colleague cosponsored with me, running around the whole month of August trying to figure out how to get this vote and how to get that vote. 
   Section 310(a) says you cannot license a foreign government in telecommunications. It has been that way since 1934. We argued and debated it in the 1996 bill. We ultimately left it alone. In spite of the White House and the FCC and all the other legal shenanigans they have ongoing, the law is still there, but they are trying to confuse that. 
   It is like Spain with the fifth column. We have the enemy within, like Bobby Kennedy wrote about. I mean, I am not worried about China. I would run it the same way they are running it. They have a $68 to $70 billion plus balance of trade. We have got $70 billion minus balance of trade and it has been growing each year. It is going to continue to grow. 
   This is not about jobs in the United States. It is about jobs in China. The Wall Street Journal had a big headline that said investors are racing now to invest in downtown Beijing, get a foothold there and then get the protection of the WTO--because you know who the WTO is going to rule in favor of. Fidel Castro can cancel your vote, Senator, my vote, the U.S. vote. I mean, come on, the WTO setting our trade policy? 
   I have introduced a bill in each of the last sessions of Congress and I will introduce it again next year. I am trying to get the 28 Departments and the Agencies coordinated in a department of trade and commerce so that we can have a coordinated assault on the needs of this Nation. At the present time, it is all spread around, disparate. You have the policy from the Trade Representative. No, it is the Commerce Secretary. No, it is the Secretary of Defense. No, it is the White House. No, it is some other ruling that the administrative body, the FCC, has made. That is why we have these booming 60,000 lawyers at the bar in the District of Columbia--not 6, 60,000. I believe 59,000 of them are communications lawyers. 
   If we could just coordinate and get one trade policy for this country and get competitive like the old Yankee trader; otherwise, we are losing our jobs, our manufacturing. We are in economic decline. We are losing our middle class. Unfortunately, we are losing the strength of our democracy. I really believe that. 
   My friend, the Senator from New York, says this is a most important vote. Well, I think it is just as important for the exact opposite reason, that we kill it, not pass it, kill this thing, have regular trade, not normal, because we have been losing. I want to start competing. I certainly don't want a permanent trade agreement. Don't have one Congress try to bind the other Congresses. ``Permanent'' was put in there by the NAM Business Roundtable and the downtown lawyers. They are trying to get predictability to that investment over there, and they want to come back and tell ensuing Congresses: Look, you told us it was permanent and so we have our money over there. 
   And so just like the Senator from Arkansas protects Wal-Mart, which he should, maybe I would be here trying to protect a textile company that wants to produce in downtown Beijing.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. 
   Mr. President, there is no question, as the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York have said--the chairman and ranking member--this is highly important, but for a different reason. 
   There is no question that we are going to have trade with China. The objection I have at this particular moment is with respect to the permanent nature of normal trade relations. I want to eliminate the permanence so we will have annual reviews to see exactly how our investments, our creation of jobs, our trade is coming along with respect to national security. 
   Tom Donohue, down at the Chamber of Commerce, says that it is going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. I am willing to bet him--and he can name the odds and the amounts--that we are going to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
   This is for an investment agreement in China, so that investments will flow to China and remain undisturbed by possible U.S. retaliation, protected by their joining in the WTO. And then, when we bring up various things to protect the security interests of the United States,--at the WTO level, Cuba votes us out because it has an equal vote. 
   The important point to remember, and President Clinton acknowledged at the very beginning of the summer and the PNTR consideration, although he could not understand it, was what he characterized as ``global anxiety.'' 
   Let me tell him a little bit about that anxiety. Oneida Mills, in Andrews, SC, closed. They had 487 employees. Their average age was 47 years of age. The company moved to Mexico and their 478 employees were out of a job. And what does Washington tell them? They say: Reeducate. They almost sound like Mao Tse Tong. Reeducate, with high skills. Don't you understand, in the global competition you have to have high skills. 
   Tomorrow morning we have done just that. We have 487 high-skilled computer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer operator? Those 487 are ``dead-lined.'' They are out of a job. 
   Earlier this week I checked the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since NAFTA, we have lost 39,200 textile and apparel jobs alone in the little State of South Carolina. 
   Anxiety--there is justified anxiety across the Nation--where we have lost over 400,000 textile and apparel jobs since NAFTA, with the outflow of the industrial strength down south and over into the Pacific rim. 
   They do not understand globali- zation, says the President. They do not understand global competition. Global competition started back at the end of World War II under the Marshall Plan in 1945. We sent over the expertise, we sent over the machinery, and we sent over the money so they could have global competition. 
   Our southern Governors helped hasten along and expedite global competition 40 years ago. I traveled to Germany. We now have 116 German plants in the little State of South Carolina. So we know about global competition. 
   But what has really occurred--with the fall of the wall--is that 4 billion workers have entered the workforce of the world, willing to work for anything. With NAFTA and WTO, and the rise of the Internet, you can transfer your technology on a computer, you can transfer your finances on a satellite. With the Internet, you 
   don't have to go to Mexico, you don't have to go to the Pacific rim; you can operate your plant from a New York office. That is a wonderful operation. As a result, as the Wall Street Journal said, this agreement is for investment in China and not in the United States. 
   There is global anxiety. There should be global anxiety. And we are trying to go and develop a competitive trade policy. Every country in Europe, every country in the Pacific rim has controlled trade, and we, as children, run around still babbling ``free trade, free trade,'' giving away our industrial strength. 
   We have come from that beginning, that at the end of World War II, 41 percent of our workforce was in manufacturing. Now it is down to 12 percent. And as Akio Morita, a founder of Sony, cautioned in a speech back in the 1980s: That a world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. And that is where we are. In Washington, we are not discussing paying the bill. They all say, ``pay down the debt,'' but the debt has gone up. I have the figures right here. 
   The debt has gone up exactly $12 billion. Here it is, the public debt to the penny, since the beginning of the fiscal year. There is not any surplus. And otherwise we need to understand the deficit and the balance of trade, where we do not have anything to export. 
   We have a $350 billion deficit in the balance of trade. And little Japan has out manufactured the great United States of America. As we waste our economic strength on spending over $175 billion a year more than we take in, as we have done, since President Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget. We have drained the tub of industrial strength with this naive ``free trade, free trade, free trade.'' 
   No. I am a competitor. I understand the global competition. We like the investments that we have. We like the global competition. But the United States has not begun to fight. 
   I would be glad to yield when I see someone come to the floor. I just hate to see this valuable time wasted. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I be able to continue until we see the next speaker.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer because I think I am going to get him to join me. 
   I have had a dynamic debate with the Senators from Washington for over 30-some years because they have Boeing, the outstanding export industry of the United States. 
   Now, they believe in controlled trade, as I do, because they use all the technology and research from our Department of Defense on the one hand, and they use the financing of the Export-Import Bank on the other hand. I believe in that Export-Import Bank, and the subsidization of the Boeing sales, because we have to meet the competition of Airbus. So I support that. But they should not come telling me about  free trade because we do not finance textile sales; we do not finance much textile research. 
   So we can look back to last December--a year ago--at the demonstration in Seattle. There was an anarchist group that came up from Eugene, OR, but I am talking about the responsible AFL-CIO demonstration there. That particular demonstration was led by the Boeing machinists--the premium single export industry in the United States. Why? Because much of that Boeing 777 is required to be made in China in order to sell in China. That is not free trade. That is requiring local content provisions. 
   So as they require it there, they require it otherwise in Europe. That is why we have tried, for 50 years, to set the example to have no subsidies, no tariffs, no content requirements, have absolutely free trade. The dynamic of the global competition is one of control for the security interests of the nations involved. 
   I believe if I was running Japan, I would do it the same way, or if I was running China. It works. In 10 years, they have gone from a $6 billion-plus balance of trade with the United States to $68 billion. They are cleaning our clock. With this particular PNTR, will we ever wake up? Our friend John F. Kennedy wrote the book ``While England Slept.'' I am tempted to write the book ``While America Slept.'' Kennedy's book was how the great British empire that brought Germany to its knees, the conqueror, the victor was brought to its knees by the vanquished. That is exactly what is happening to the United States of America. We are going the way of England. 
   They told the Brits at the end of World War II, they said: Don't worry, instead of a nation of brawn, you will be a nation of brains; instead of producing products, you will provide services, a service economy; instead of creating wealth, you will handle it and be a financial center. England has gone to hell in an economic hand basket. London is nothing more than an amusement park. Their army is not as big as our Marines, and they have lost their clout in world affairs. Money talks. 
   So not only are we losing our middle class--as Henry Ford said, ``I want to pay that worker enough to buy what he is producing,'' which helped begin not only the wonderful development of a middle class in America, the strength of our democracy--but our clout in international and foreign policy. 
   I thank the Chair for its indulgence. We will continue in September to try to get everyone's attention, so we can compete. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nancy Foster Scholarship Act, legislation to create a scholarship program in marine biology or oceanography in honor of Dr. Nancy Foster, head of the National Ocean Service at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) until her passing on Tuesday, June 27, 2000. I am proud to introduce legislation to commemorate the life and work of such a wonderful leader, mentor, and coastal advocate. I thank my colleagues Senators SNOWE, KERRY, STEVENS, BREAUX, and CLELAND for joining me in recognizing Dr. Foster's strong commitment to improving the conservation and scientific understanding of our precious coastal resources. 
   My legislation would create a Nancy Foster Marine Biology Scholarship Program within the Department of Commerce. This Program would provide scholarship funds to outstanding women and minority graduate students to support and encourage independent graduate level research in marine biology. It is my hope that this scholarship program will promote the development of future leaders of Dr. Foster's caliber.  
   Dr. Foster was the first woman to direct a NOAA line office, and during her 23 years at NOAA rose to one of the most senior levels a career professional can achieve. She directed the complete modernization of NOAA's essential nautical mapping and charting programs, and created a ground-breaking partnership with the National Geographic Society to launch a 5-year undersea exploration program called the Sustainable Seas Expedition. Dr. Foster was a strong and enthusiastic mentor to young people and a staunch ally to her colleagues, and for this reason, I believe the legislation I am introducing today to be the most appropriate way for us all to ensure that her deep commitment to marine science continues on in others. 
   Mr. President, we will all feel Dr. Foster's loss deeply for years to come. The creation of a scholarship program in her honor is one small way we can thank a person who did so much for us all.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today, to introduce the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2000. This legislation is long overdue. It is needed to facilitate future technological and advances and increases in international trade, and ensure that we have the sort of security control necessary to ensure that our borders are protected from drug smuggling, illegal aliens, trade fraud, threats of terrorism as well as potential threats to our ability to mobilize U.S. military force. 
   The Department of Transportation recently commenced an evaluation of our marine transportation needs for the 21st Century. In September 1999, Transportation Secretary Slater issued a preliminary report of the Marine Transportation System (MTS) Task Force--An Assessment of the U.S. Marine Transportation System. The report reflected a highly collaborative effort among public sector agencies, private sector organizations and other stakeholders in the MTS. 
   The report indicates that the United States has more than 1,000 harbor channels and 25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal, and coastal waterways in the United States which serve over 300 ports, with more than 3,700 terminals that handle passenger and cargo movements. These waterways and ports link to 152,000 miles of railways, 460,000 miles of underground pipelines and 45,000 miles of interstate highways. Annually, the U.S. marine transportation system moves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight, imports 3.3 billion tons of domestic oil, transports 134 million passengers by ferry, serves 78 million Americans engaged in recreational boating, and hosts more than 5 million cruise ship passengers. 
   The MTS provides economic value, as waterborne cargo contributes more than $742 billion to U.S. gross domestic product and creates employment for more than 13 million citizens. While these figures reveal the magnitude of our waterborne commerce, they don't reveal the spectacular growth of waterborne commerce, or the potential problems in coping with this growth. It is estimated that the total volume of domestic and international trade is expected to double over the next twenty years. The doubling of trade also brings up the troubling issue of how the U.S. is going to protect our maritime borders from crime, threats of terrorism, or even our ability to mobilize U.S. armed forces. 
   Security at our maritime borders is given substantially less federal consideration than airports or land borders. In the aviation industry, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is intimately involved in ensuring that security measures are developed, implemented, and funded. The FAA works with various Federal officials to assess threats directed toward commercial aviation and to target various types of security measures as potential threats change. For example, during the Gulf War, airports were directed to ensure that no vehicles were parked within a set distance of the entrance to a terminal. 
   Currently, each air carrier, whether a U.S. carrier or foreign air carrier, is required to submit a proposal on how it plans to meet its security needs. Air carriers also are responsible for screening passengers and baggage in compliance with FAA regulations. The types of machines used in airports are all approved, and in many instances paid for by the FAA. The FAA uses its laboratories to check the machinery to determine if the equipment can detect explosives that are capable of destroying commercial aircrafts. Clearly, we learned from the Pan Am 103 disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. Congress passed legislation in 1990 ``the Aviation Security Improvement Act,'' which was carefully considered by the Commerce Committee, to develop the types of measures I noted above. We also made sure that airports, the FAA, air carriers and law enforcement worked together to protect the flying public. 
   Following the crash of TWA flight 800 in 1996, we also leaped to spend money, when it was first thought to have been caused by a terrorist act. The FAA spent about $150 million on additional screening equipment, and we continue today to fund research and development for better, and more effective equipment. Finally, the FAA is responsible for ensuring that background checks (employment records/criminal records) of security screeners and those with access to secured airports are carried out in an effective and thorough manner. The FAA, at the direction of Congress, is responsible for certifying screening companies, and has developed ways to better test screeners. This is all done in the name of protecting the public. Seaports deserve no less consideration. 
   At land borders, there is a similar investment in security by the federal government. In TEA-21, approved $140 million a year for five years for the National Corridor Planning and Development and Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program. Eligible activities under this program include improvements to existing transportation and supporting infrastructure that facilitate cross-border vehicles and cargo movements; construction of highways and related safety enforcement facilities that facilitate movements related to international trade; operational improvements, including improvements relating to electronic data interchange and use of telecommunications, to expedite cross border vehicle and cargo movements; and planning, coordination, design and location studies. 
   By way of contrast, at U.S. seaports, the federal government invests nothing in infrastructure, other than the human presence of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and whatever equipment those agencies have to accomplish their mandates. Physical infrastructure is provided by state-controlled port authorities, or by private sector marine terminal operators. There are no controls, or requirements in place, except for certain standards promulgated by the Coast Guard for the protection of cruise ship passenger terminals. Essentially, where sea ports are concerned we have abrogated the federal responsibility of border control to the state and private sector. 
   I think that the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Agency are doing an outstanding job, but they are outgunned. There is simply too much money in the illegal activities they are seeking to curtail or eradicate, and there is too much traffic coming into, and out of the United States. For instance, in the latest data available, 1999, we had more than 10 million TEU's imported into the United States. For the uninitiated, a TEU refers to a twenty-foot equivalent unit shipping container. By way of comparison, a regular truck measures 48-feet in length. So in translation, we imported close to 5 million truckloads of cargo. According to the Customs Service, seaports are able to inspect between 1 percent and 2 percent of the containers, so in other words, a drug smuggler has a 98 percent chance of gaining illegal entry. 
   It is amazing to think, that when you or I walk through an international airport we will walk through a metal detector, and our bags will be x-rayed, and Customs will interview us, and may check our bags. However, at a U.S. seaport you could import a 48 foot truck load of cargo, and have at least a 98 percent chance of not even being inspected. It just doesn't seem right. 
   For instance, in my own state, the Port of Charleston which is the fourth largest container port in the United States, Customs officials have no equipment even capable of x-raying intermodal shipping containers. Customs, which is understaffed to start with, must physically open containers, and request the use of a canine unit from local law enforcement to help with drug or illegal contraband detection. This is simply not sufficient. 
   The need for the evaluation of higher scrutiny of our system of seaport security came at the request of Senator  GRAHAM, and I would like to at this time commend him for his persistent efforts to address this issue. Senator GRAHAM has had problems with security at some of the Florida seaports, and although the state has taken some steps to address the issue, there is a great need for considerable improvement. Senator GRAHAM laudably convinced the President to appoint a Commission, designed similarly to the Aviation Security Commission, to review security at U.S. seaports. 
   The Commission visited twelve major U.S. seaports, as well as two foreign ports. It compiled a record of countless hours of testimony and heard from, and reviewed the security practices of the shipping industry. It also met with local law enforcement officials to discuss the issues and their experiences as a result of seaport related crime. Unfortunately, the report will not be publicly available until sometime in the fall; however, Senator GRAHAM's staff and my staff have worked closely with the Commission, to develop legislation--the bill that we are introducing--to address the Commission's concerns. 
   For instance, the Commission found that twelve U.S. seaports accounted for 56 percent of the number of cocaine seizures, 32 percent of the marijuana seizures, and 65 percent of heroin seizures in commercial cargo shipments and vessels at all ports of entry nationwide. Yet, we have done relatively little, other than send in an undermanned contingency of Coast Guards and Customs officials to do whatever they can. 
   Drugs are not the only criminal problem confronting U.S. seaports. For example, alien smuggling has become increasingly lucrative enterprise. To illustrate, in August of 1999, I.N.S. officials found 132 Chinese men hiding aboard a container ship docked in Savannah, Georgia. The INS district director was quoted as saying; ``This was a very sophisticated ring, and never in my 23 years with the INS have I seen anything as large or sophisticated''. According to a recent GAO report on INS efforts on alien smuggling (RPT-Number: B-283952), smugglers collectively may earn as much as several billion dollars per year bringing in illegal aliens. 
   Another problem facing seaports is cargo theft. Cargo theft does not always occur at seaports, but in many instances the theft has occurred because of knowledge of cargo contents. International shipping provides access to a lot of information and a lot of cargo to many different people along the course of its journey. We need to take steps to ensure that we do not facilitate theft. Losses as a result of cargo theft have been estimated as high as $12 billion annually, and it has been reported to have increased by as much as 20 percent recently. The FBI has become so concerned that it recently established a multi-district task force, Operation Sudden Stop, to crack down on cargo crime. 
   The other issues facing seaport security may be less evident, but potentially of greater threat. As a nation in 
   general, we have been relatively lucky to have been free of some of the terrorist threats that have plagued other nations. However, we must not become complacent. U.S. seaports are extremely exposed. On a daily basis many seaports have cargo that could cause serious illness and death to potentially large populations of civilians living near seaports if targeted by terrorism. 
   The sheer magnitude of most seaports, their historical proximity to established population bases, the open nature of the facility, and the massive quantities of hazardous cargoes being shipped through a port could be extremely threatening to the large populations that live in areas surrounding our seaports. The same conditions in U.S. seaports, that could expose us to threats from terrorism, could also be used to disrupt our abilities to mobilize militarily. During the Persian Gulf War, 95 percent of our military cargo was carried by sea. Disruption of sea service, could have resulted in a vastly different course of history. We need to ensure that it does not happen to any future military contingencies. 
   As I mentioned before, our seaports are international borders, and consequently we should treat them as such. However, I am realistic about the possibilities for increasing seaport security, the realities of international trade, and the many functional differences inherent in the different seaport localities. Seaports by their very nature, are open and exposed to surrounding areas, and as such it will be impossible to control all aspects of security, however, sensitive or critical safety areas should be protected. I also understand that U.S. seaports have different security needs in form and scope. For instance, a seaport in Alaska, that has very little international cargo does not need the same degree of attention that a seaport in a major metropolitan center, which imports and exports thousands of international shipments. However, the legislation we are introducing today will allow for public input and will consider local issues in the implementation of new guidelines on port security, so as to address such details. 
   Substantively, the Port and Maritime Security Act establishes a multi-pronged effort to address security needs at U.S. Seaports, and in some cases formalizes existing practices that have proven effective. The bill authorizes the Coast Guard to establish a task force on port security in consultation with U.S. Customs and the Maritime Administration. 
   The purpose of the task force is to implement the provisions of the act; to coordinate programs to enhance the security and safety of U.S. seaports; to provide long-term solutions for seaport safety issues; to coordinate with local port security committees established by the Coast Guard to implement the provisions of the bill; and to ensure that the public and local port security committees are kept informed about seaport security enhancement developments. 
   The bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to establish local port security committees at each U.S. seaport. The membership of these committees is to include representatives of the port authority, labor organizations, the private sector, and federal, state, and local government officials. These committees will be chaired by the U.S. Coast Guard's Captain-of-the-Port, and will implement the provisions and requirements of the bill locally, to ensure that local considerations are considered in the establishment of security guidelines. 
   The bill requires the task force, in consultation with the U.S. Customs Service and MarAd, to develop a system of providing port security threat assessments for U.S. seaports, and to revise this assessment at least triennially. The threat assessment shall be performed with the assistance of local officials, through local port security committees, and ensure the port is made aware of and participates in the analysis of security concerns. 
   The bill also requires the task force to develop voluntary minimum security guidelines that are linked to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain-of-the-Port controls, to include a model port concept, and to include recommended ``best practices'' guidelines for use of maritime terminal operators. Local port security committees are to participate in the formulation of security guidelines, and the Coast Guard is required to pursue the international adoption of similar security guidelines. Additionally, the Maritime Administration (MarAd) is required to pursue the adoption of proper private sector accreditation of ports that adhere to guidelines (similar to a underwriters lab approval, or ISO 9000 accreditations). 
   The bill authorizes MarAd to provide Title XI loan guarantees to cover the costs of port security infrastructure improvements, such as cameras and other monitoring equipment, fencing systems and other types of physical enhancements. The bill authorizes $10 million, annually for four years, to cover costs, as defined by the Credit Reform Act, which could guarantee up to $400 million in loans for security enhancements. The bill also establishes a matching grant program to develop and transfer technology to enhance security at U.S. seaports. The U.S. Customs Service may award up to $12 million annually for four years for this technology program, which is required to be awarded on a competitive basis. Long-term technology development is needed to ensure that we can develop non-intrusive technology 
   that will allow trade to expand, but also allow us greater ability to detect criminal threat. 
   The bill also authorizes additional funding for the U.S. Customs Service to carry out the requirements of the  bill, and more generally, to enhance seaport security. The bill requires a report to be attached on security and a revision of 1997 document entitled ``Port Security: A National Planning Guide.'' The report and revised guide are to be submitted to Congress and are to include a description of activities undertaken under the Port and Maritime Security Act of 2000, in addition to analysis of the effect of those activities on port security and preventing acts of terrorism and crime. 
   The bill requires the Attorney General, to the extent feasible, to coordinate reporting of seaport related crimes and to work with state law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data on cargo theft. Better data will be crucial in identifying the extent and location of criminal threats and will facilitate law enforcement efforts combating crime. The bill also requires the Secretaries of Agriculture, Treasury, and Transportation, as well as the Attorney General to work together to establish shared dockside inspection facilities at seaports for federal and state agencies, and authorizes $3 million, annually for four years, to carry out this section. The bill also requires the Customs Service to improve reporting of imports at seaports, and to eliminate user fees for domestic U.S.- flag carriers carrying in-bond domestic cargo. 
   Finally, the bill reauthorizes an extension of tonnage duties through 2006, and makes available $40,000,000 from the collections of these duties to carry out the Port and Maritime Security Act. These fees currently are set at certain levels, and are scheduled to be reduced in 2002. The legislation reauthorizes and extends the current fee level for an additional four years, but dedicates its use to enhancing our efforts to fight crime at U.S. seaports and to facilitating improved protection of our borders, as well as to enhance our efforts to ward off potential threats of terrorism.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I speak to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee. There is no question that China proliferates. The very interesting feature to the entire picture here is that they object, of course, to us defending ourselves. As I see it, in essence, they are saying: Wait a minute. If you get a strategic defense initiative, if you get an antiballistic missile defense, that is going to deter or retard our proliferation, our sales to Pakistan, our sales to Iran. 
   A nation's defense should never be negotiable. It is totally out of the question. We should not be running around talking to the Europeans or those in the Pacific rim when it comes to what  is necessary and fundamentally needed for the defense of the United States. 
   I support the Senator from Tennessee.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, two Saturdays ago, Mr. Peter S. Goodman reported in the Washington Post on the design of Deutsche Telekom, a German government company, which is designed to take over any and all U.S. telecommunications. In the final paragraph of that particular story, the head of Deutsche Telekom said, no, they were not interested in joint ventures. They were interested in total control. 
   This Senator from South Carolina participated in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, deregulating and decontrolling the American telecommunications industry. We certainly didn't take it out from under American control to put it under German government control. 
   I placed a call to the head of the Federal Communications Commission. We had a conversation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, sections 310(a) and 310(b) are very clear. 
   It could be noted historically--because there has been an ongoing intramural debate with respect to the turning over of our telecommunications to foreign governments by the White House, by this administration, by the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Barshefsky, and its minions--that we have had to struggle with, and I included those documents. 
   I reference also that particular letter of July 12 because in there I cited the ongoing concern of then former Ambassador Mickey Kantor with respect to German government participation in America's telecommunications. 
   I also cited in there that the head of the international bureau, Mr. Scott Blake Harris, in 1995, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that section 310(a)'s outright ban on foreign government ownership should be retained. 
   Of course, we had the act in February of 1996. Subsequent to that, later in 1996, the head of the FCC's former international bureau, just retired, included a very instructive article in the National Law Journal:  
   More problematic, however, are the restrictions placed by the Communications Act on ownership of wireless licenses by a foreign government or its representative. Section 310(a) flatly prohibits a foreign government or its representative from holding any wireless license, directly or indirectly. This limitation is not subject to an FCC waiver.  
   Mr. President, there is no question that law has not been changed. 
   I know about the attempts made by Ambassador Barshefsky and the global telecommunications agreement in 1997--that if you are a Member of the WTO, then you automatically qualify under the public interest requirement of the telecommunications law to own U.S. telecommunications assets. They say it's in the public interest, that it promotes competition. 
   That has been the wag, or argument, that I have heard from time immemorial. But that is not the case at all. You take Deutsche Telekom, which recently had a bond issue. It was very successful--$14 billion. Mind you me, they wouldn't have collected some $14 billion if it were a private company. But this is ``a government cannot fail'' with one-third of the employees having permanent employment. You cannot fire them. That is Deutsche Telekom, and by the Chairman's own acknowledgment, with 58-percent German government ownership. 
   We are not talking about German entities. We are talking about the German government. You can't let foreign governmental ownership enter the free market here, a market that has been deregulated by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, and say: Oh, yes, we are ready to compete. 
   We have a strange situation whereby Deutsche Telekom under Ambassador Barshefsky and some in the White House--and perhaps some at the FCC--say: Yes. It is already in the public interest. They are competitive; we are promoting competition. But Deutsche Telekom can take over, let's say, AT&T, but under the law, categorically, Bell South cannot. 
   Let me mention why I emphasize the German government--because there was a letter by the distinguished chairman of our committee, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, in which he referred to ``entities.'' He didn't refer to the government. Let's get right to entities and globalization. 
   There was a recent article that said, after all, Senator HOLLINGS was a veteran of World War II where he fought against the Germans. It suggested that Sen. HOLLINGS was anti-German and that he thought maybe the German government wouldn't be friendly. You know, coming from South Carolina, we are supposed to be dumb, and Senator HOLLINGS just didn't understand that we have moved into 
   globalization, the world economy, and world competition. 
   I don't want to sound like Vice President Gore, but I am constrained to acknowledge that maybe I helped start globalization. As the Governor of South Carolina in 1960, I went to Europe in order to attract German industry investment in South Carolina. As I stand on the floor, I have 116 German industries in the State of South Carolina. I have the headquarters of British Bowater. I have the North American headquarters of Michelin. They have 11,600 employees. I have Hoffman-LaRoche from Switzerland. 
   You ought to come down there and join the smorgasbord of global competition. 
   That is not the case that concerns the Senator from South Carolina. What concerns me is ``governmental.'' We certainly didn't deregulate American control to put it under German control. It is that clear. It does not require any careful review. The law is the law. We refuse to change it. The White House acts like it has been changed. Some on the FCC act like it has been changed. The law and the policy have not been changed. 
   Several things have occurred. We have a bill in with 15 cosponsors, with the distinguished majority and minority leaders as cosponsors. We have over on the House side Congressmen Dingell and Markey who introduced a similar bill. We put a rider on the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, which is an appropriations bill that lasts for only one year, and no money is to be expended to give licenses to foreign governments under Section 310. 
   You would think that they would get it. The Dutch got it. It is very interesting that KPN tried to take over Telefonica d'Espana. They were rejected. Incidentally, Deutsche Telekom tried to take over Telecom Italia. Italy voted them out. Singapore Tel tried to  take over Hong Kong Telephone. Hong Kong voted them out.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President:  
   The Dutch Government may slash its 43.5 percent stake in Dutch carrier KPN Telecom to just over 20 percent as part of a global share issue slated for the fourth quarter, an industry source said on Wednesday.  
   If a foreign government owns more than 25 percent of the telephone company, they are not welcome. If they own less than 25 percent, they are welcome. We love the Germans. Tell them to come to America. 
   One addendum. This won't take but a couple of minutes because the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is on the floor. I hold the earlier announcement from a newspaper this week that the surplus forecast has doubled. We heard the distinguished Senator, Mr. ROTH of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, putting through his budget. We had a vote this morning on the marriage penalty. Tax cut, tax cut, tax cut. To this Senator who lives in the real world, that is an increase in the debt. 
   When they announced this, I went to what they call the Budget and Economic Outlook of the Congressional Budget Office. That is what the article quoted that said the surplus doubled. On page 17, we can see the debt, as reported by the CBO, goes from $5.617 trillion to $6.370 trillion, an increase of $753 billion. 
   It wasn't there that they found the surplus. I said, the President is always good at finding surpluses, so I went to his Mid-session Review, table 23 on page 49 in the back, and I see instead that the debt increased $1 trillion. 
   Then I called Treasury and I asked them. I have now the most recent report from this morning. It shows the public debt to the penny. It has increased $22 billion according to the U.S. Treasury. 
   I reiterate the Budget Committee's wonderful offer: If you want to become a millionaire--and I am sure the distinguished chairman can find that million in the surplus; I have heard him mention it, also--we will give $1 million to anyone who can find a real surplus that Congress and all the media are talking about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator's question concludes--as astute as our distinguished chairman is--the answer. It is that Deutsche Telekom is government regulated and controlled. That is the best answer. We were trying to continue the competition, but we cannot compete with the government coming in. If they are going to allow that, I vote under your budget and mine that we go over there and take over China's communications. If we can take over China's communications, we can cut the defense budget in half. They wouldn't know where to go or how to do it. We would be in charge over there in Beijing. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember our friend Paul Coverdell. The state of Georgia and the United States have lost a talented and dedicated statesman. 
   Senator Coverdell's workmanlike approach to government was a breath of fresh air in today's atmosphere of glamour politics. He didn't aspire to be in the spotlight, but he fought tirelessly to spotlight the issues in which he believed. Whether you agreed with his position on those issues or not, you admired his style--his lack of pretense, willingness to complete tedious, but important tasks, and pleasant demeanor during a tough debate. 
   His office was one floor above mine in the Russell Building and we often rode the subway together over to the Capitol. His easygoing nature always struck me as particularly Southern. We shared a love for that slow, gracious lifestyle of our home states and enjoyed working together when it served the similar needs of our constituents. 
   Paul had a deep appreciation for the office of U.S. Senator having persevered in his quest for a Senate seat in 1992 despite a highly-competitive race that featured two runoffs. For the next eight years, he never took the privilege of serving the people of Georgia or the nation lightly. We can all learn something from his example. 
   Service was an evolving theme in Paul Coverdell's life, beginning with an overseas stint in the U.S. Army, later followed by almost two decades in the Georgia state Senate and a post in President Bush's administration as Director of the U.S. Peace Corps. He was well-prepared when he arrived in the Senate chamber and used his experience to advance an aggressive legislative agenda. It was a pleasure to serve in the U.S. Senate with Paul Coverdell. He fought fairly, was gracious in victory and honorable in defeat.  
   My sympathy goes out to his wife, Nancy, and other family members and to the people of Georgia.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, do you want to make $1 million? Do you want to become a millionaire? All you have to do is find the surplus that is in the headlines. 
   This morning, USA Today said ``surplus doubles.'' 
   That crowd knows how to write, but they do not know how to read. 
   I have the Congressional Budget Office report that they quoted. On page 17, the debt goes from $5.617 trillion to $6.370 trillion. The debt is going up. The surplus is going down. 
   I thought maybe they had gotten it from the President's midyear review just given 2 weeks ago. Of course, you know how they mix these things up. The last page tells the truth. On page 23, President Clinton finds that the debt goes up to $1 trillion--no surplus. The debt increases. 
   I then go to the public debt to the penny. Call up Treasury. They give this out every day. You find how the debt goes up. 
   What they are trying to do is increase the debt with this $248 billion. 
   I am for paying down the debt. 
   Vote for the amendment if you are for paying down the debt, please.

Tom Brokaw has written that the greatest generation suffered the Depression, won the war, and then came back to lead. They not only won the war but were conscientious about paying for that war and Korea and Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1969.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1969. At that time, the national debt was $365 billion with an interest cost of only $16 billion. Now, under a new generation without the cost of a war, the debt has soared to $5.6 trillion with annual interest costs of $365 billion. That is right. We spend $1 billion a day for nothing. It does not buy any defense, any education, any health care, or highways. Astoundingly, since President Johnson balanced the budget, we have increased spending $349 billion for nothing. 
   Early each morning, the Federal Government goes down to the bank and borrows $1 billion and adds it to the national debt. We have not had a surplus for 30 years. Senator TRENT LOTT, commenting on President Clinton's State of the Union Address, said the talk cost $1 billion a minute. For an hour-and-a-half talk, that would be $90 billion a year. Governor George W. Bush's tax cut costs $90 billion a year. Together, that is $180 billion. Just think, we can pay for both the Democratic and Republican programs with the money we are spending on interest and still have $185 billion to pay down the national debt. Instead, the debt increases, interest costs increase, while all in town, all in the Congress, shout: Surplus, surplus, surplus. 
   Understand the game. Ever since President Johnson's balanced budget, the Government has spent more each year than it has taken in--a deficit. The average deficit for the past 30 years was $175 billion a year. This is with both Democratic and Republican Presidents and Democratic and Republican Congresses. Somebody wants to know why the economy is good? If you infuse $175 billion a year for some 30 years and do not pay for it, it ought to be good. 
   The trick to calling a deficit a surplus is to have the Government borrow from itself. The Federal Government, like an insurance company, has various funds held in reserve to pay benefits of the program--Social Security, Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment compensation,  highway funds, airport funds, railroad retirement funds. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a list of trust funds looted to balance this budget.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, these funds are held in trust for the specific purpose for which the taxes are collected. 
   Under corporate law, it is a felony to pay off the company debt with the pension fund. But in Washington we pay down the public debt with trust funds, call it a surplus, and they give us the ``Good Government'' award. 
   To make it sound correct, we divide the debt in two: The public debt and the private debt. Of course, our Government is public, and the law treats the debt as public without separation. The separation allows Washington politicians to say: We have paid down the public debt and have a surplus. There is no mention, of course, that the Government debt is increased by the same amount that the public debt is decreased. It is like paying off your MasterCard with your Visa card and saying you do not owe anything. Dr. Dan Crippen, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, describes this as ``taking from one pocket and putting it in the other.'' 
   For years we have been using the trust funds to report a unified budget and a unified deficit. This has led people to believe the Government was reporting net figures. It sounded authentic. But as the unified deficit appeared less and less, the national debt continued to increase. While the unified deficit in 1997 was $21.9 billion, the actual deficit was $187.8 billion. In 1998 the unified budget reported a surplus of $70 billion, but actually there was a deficit of $109 billion. In 1999 the ``unified surplus'' was $124 billion, but the actual deficit was $127.8 billion. 
   Now comes the Presidential campaign. Social Security is a hot topic. Both parties are shouting: Save Social Security. Social Security lockbox. The economy is humming, booming. With high employment, the Social Security revenues have increased. It appears that, separate from Social Security, there will be enough trust fund money to compute a surplus. We have reached the millennium--Utopia--enough money to report a surplus without spending Social Security. 
   Washington jargon now changes. Instead of a ``unified budget,'' the Government now reports an ``on-budget'' and an ``off-budget.'' This is so we can all call it an on-budget surplus, meaning without Social Security. But to call it an on-budget surplus, the Government spends $96 billion from the other trust funds. 
   We ended last year with a deficit of $128 billion--not a surplus. The President's budget just submitted shows an actual deficit each year for the next 5 years. Instead of paying down the debt, the President shows, on page 420 of his budget, the debt increasing from the year 2000 to the year 2013--$5.686 trillion to $6.815 trillion, an increase of $1.129 trillion. 
   They are all talking about paying off the debt by 2013, and the actual document they submit shows the debt increasing each year, and over that period an increase of over $1 trillion. 
   Each year, Congress spends more than the President's budgets. There is no chance of a surplus with both sides proposing to reduce revenues with a tax cut. But we have a sweetheart deal: The Republicans will call a deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote with tax cuts; the Democrats will call the deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote with increased spending. The worst abuse of campaign finance is using the Federal budget to buy votes. 
   Alan Greenspan could stop this. He could call a deficit a deficit. Instead, appearing before Congress in his confirmation hearing, Greenspan, talking of the Federal budget, stated: ``I would fear very much that these huge surpluses......'' and on and on. We are in real trouble when Greenspan calls huge deficits ``huge surpluses.'' Greenspan thinks his sole role is to protect the financial markets. He does not want the U.S. Government coming into the market borrowing billions to pay its deficit, crowding out private capital, and running up interest costs. 
   But Congress' job is to not only protect the financial markets but the overall economy. Our job, as the board of directors for the Federal Government, is to make sure the Government pays its bills. In short, our responsibility is to eliminate waste. 
   The biggest waste of all is to continue to run up the debt with devastating interest costs for nothing. In good times, the least we can do is put this Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. Greenspan's limp admonition to ``pay down the debt'' is just to cover his backside. He knows better. He should issue a clarion call to stop increasing the debt. While he is raising interest rates to cool the economy, he should categorically oppose tax cuts to stimulate it. 
   Our only hope is the free press. In the earliest days, Thomas Jefferson observed, given a choice between a free government and a free press, he would choose the latter. Jefferson believed strongly that with the press reporting the truth to the American people, the Government would stay free. 
   Our problem is that the press and media have joined the conspiracy to defraud. They complain lamely that the Federal budget process is too complicated, so they report ``surplus.'' Complicated it is. But as to being a deficit or a surplus is clear cut; it is not complicated at all. All you need to do is go to the Department of the Treasury's report on public debt. They report the growth in the national debt every day, every minute, on the Internet at ``www.publicdebt.treas.gov.'' 
   In fact, there is a big illuminated billboard on Sixth Avenue in New York that reports the increase in the debt by the minute. At present, it shows that we are increasing the debt every minute by $894,000. Think of that--$894,000 a minute. Of course, increase the debt, and interest costs rise. Already, interest costs exceed the defense budget. Interest costs, like taxes, must be paid. Worse, while regular taxes support defense, and other programs, interest taxes support waste. Running a deficit of over $100 billion today, any tax cut amounts to an interest tax increase--an increase in waste. 
   If the American people realized what was going on, they would run us all out of town.

   I know not, of course, what others may say, but as for me, I want to pay down the debt rather than engage in this shabby charade. As a result, the only way to do that and pay down the debt is stop this sweetheart deal of giving a little on spending increases and giving a little again, of course, on tax cuts. We do not have a surplus to divide. That is the point of my particular amendment.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Surface Transportation Board for issuing its rail merger moratorium, which has just been upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. We on the Commerce Committee have been watching the railroad industry closely these last several years and we believe time is needed to reevaluate where the industry has been and where it should be going. To have moved forward with a new round of mergers now would have been shortsighted and not in the public interest. I am pleased that the Board had the courage to call a time-out on rail mergers to reexamine its rail merger policy before proceeding further at this important crossroads for the rail sector. I am also gratified that the Court shared my view, and the view of many of us in the Senate, that the Board has the authority to do what needs to be done.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, since the beginning of the fiscal year, the national debt has increased, not decreased. Since we have been running a deficit and there is no surplus, any tax cut or loss of revenues only increases the debt rather than paying down the debt. Accordingly, I oppose the telephone tax cut, and I oppose this estate tax cut. As John Mitchell used to say, ``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' We say pay down the debt but we increase it.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize South Carolina's peach farmers for their hard work and their delicious peaches. 
   Today, peaches from my home State have been delivered to offices throughout the Senate and the U.S. Capitol. Thanks to South Carolina's peach farmers, those of us here in Washington will be able to cool off from the summer heat with delicious peaches. 
   For a relatively small State, South Carolina is second in the Nation in peach production. In fact, this year farmers across my State planted more than 16,000 acres of peaches. As my colleagues can attest, these are some of the finest peaches produced anywhere in the United States. 
   As we savor the taste of these peaches, we should remember the work and labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. While Americans enjoy peaches for appetizers, entrees and desserts, most do not stop to consider where they come from. Farmers will be laboring all summer in the heat and humidity to bring us what we call the ``perfect candy.'' What else curbs a sweet tooth, is delicious, nutritious and satisfying, but not fattening? 
   The truth is, Mr. President, our farmers as too often the forgotten workers in our country. Through their dedication and commitment, our nation is able to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables and other foods. In fact, our agricultural system, at times, is the envy of the world. 
   Mr. President, as Senators and their staff feast on these delicious peaches, I hope they will remember the people in South Carolina who made this endeavor possible: The South Carolina Peach Council, David Winkles and the entire South Carolina Farm Bureau. They have all worked extremely hard to ensure that the U.S. Senate gets a taste of South Carolina. 
   I am sure everyone in our Nation's Capitol will be smiling as they enjoy these delicious South Carolina peaches.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of importance to the people of South Carolina with my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Iowa. 
   In January of 1999, South Carolina enhanced its Medicaid drug program to provide eligible adults with four prescriptions a month instead of three. This was a much needed change that HCFA had encouraged South Carolina to make over a number of years. Unfortunately, South Carolina improperly notified HCFA of the coverage change. Instead of filing a State Plan amendment, South Carolina distributed a Medicaid Bulletin to relevant parties--including three officials at HCFA's Atlanta regional office, believing that to be sufficient. The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services brought their oversight to HCFA's attention. South Carolina and HCFA are currently involved in discussions regarding whether South Carolina should receive federal funds for 4th prescription expenditures that occurred between January 1, 1999 and September 30, 1999. 
   At this time, a legislative remedy does not appear necessary to allow HCFA to impose suitable fines on states that provide notice of Medicaid coverage changes but do not properly file State Plan amendments. I am encouraged by the response officials in South Carolina have received from HCFA and hopeful that a resolution can be reached in a manner agreeable to all parties. Nevertheless, I wanted to bring this matter to the attention of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee and inform them that I may revisit this issue at a later date if necessary.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce at the request of the Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission Enhanced Enforcement Act of 2000. This legislation is designed to enhance the authority of the CSPC to prevent the manufacture and sale of defective products. 
   The legislation seeks to accomplish this goal in two significant ways. First, it proposes to remove the cap that exists under current law on the maximum civil penalty that can be assessed to companies that market products in violation of federal consumer product safety regulations. Currently, the maximum civil penalty that can be assessed to companies that violate consumer product safety laws is $1,650,000, a figure that is less than the amount that generally could be assessed by the CPSC. According to the agency, in many instances, it seeks penalties against very large companies, which likely are not deterred by the $1,650,000 cap. Second, the legislation proposes to increase the CPSC's authority over recalls by authorizing the Commission to determine the manner in which a defective product is to be corrected. Currently, a company that has marketed a defective product has the right to determine the remedy that is offered to the public, regardless of whether the selected remedy is the most effective solution. The proposed legislation alters this situation by permitting the CPSC to choose the remedy that is best suited to protect the public as opposed to the company. 
   For these reasons, Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this act on behalf of the Administration and the CPSC.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with the most heartfelt sadness that I rise today to commemorate the life of Dr. Nancy Foster, who passed away Tuesday at her home in Baltimore, Maryland. As I stand here today I recall that only a year ago I spoke to you about Dr. Foster's outstanding work as head of the National Ocean Service at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The news of her passing was bitter pill. Not only was Dr. Foster a dedicated and visionary public servant, but she was also universally admired and loved. I know that her creativity, boundless energy, and compassion will be sorely missed both here and at NOAA. Dr. Foster's efforts in my home state of South Carolina both as head of NOS and then at NOAA's Fisheries Service were testaments to her skill at bringing groups together to solve incredibly complex coastal problems, from protecting our sea turtles to conserving and understanding our precious coastal resources. The world is a better place for her having served here with us. 
   Dr. Foster came to NOAA in 1977 and spent her career promoting programs to explore, map, protect and develop sustainably our Nation's coastal and fishery resources. She helped create the National Marine Sanctuary Program and Estuarine Research Reserve Program. These programs preserve America's near shore and offshore marine environments in the same manner as do the better known national parks and wildlife refuges on land. Nancy went on to serve as the Director of Protected Resources at NOAA's Fisheries Service, where she managed the Government's programs to protect and conserve whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other endangered and protected species. After that, Dr. Foster was named the Deputy Director of the Fisheries Service, where she forged alliances between fishing and conservation groups to ensure both the protection of our living marine resources and the sustainability of our human resources. I particularly recall her special efforts in South Carolina, where she worked hand in hand with our shrimpers to help them devise ways of keeping sea turtles out of their nets. 
   In 1977, Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and NOAA Under Secretary Jim Baker tapped Nancy to take over the National Ocean Service. Not only was she the first woman to direct a NOAA line office, but she was given one of the most senior levels a career professional can achieve; in other agencies or bureaus, such a position would be reserved for at least an Assistant Secretary-level official. NOS has the longest running mission of all the NOAA line offices--coastal mapping traces its lineage back to 1807--and she pioneered a reinvention effort that has made the Ocean Service one of the most modern and effective of the line offices. A proven innovator, she directed the total modernization of NOAA's essential nautical mapping and charting programs. In addition, along with Dr. Sylvia Earle she created a ground-breaking partnership with the National Geographic Society to launch a 5-year undersea exploration program called `Sustainable Seas Expedition.' to rekindle our nation's interest in the oceans, and especially the national marine sanctuaries. This effort has sparked the kind of enthusiasm about the oceans that Jacques Cousteau created when I first came to the Senate. 
   While the Federal Government frequently recognized Dr. Foster's contributions through numerous important awards, she was also a person whom the rank and file employees at NOAA--the marine biologists, researchers, and managers--trusted and admired. She was a strong and enthusiastic mentor to young people and a staunch ally to her colleagues. She has, and always will, serve as a role model for professional women everywhere, especially those who work in the sciences. Nancy Foster was that rare official whom we in the Congress looked to for leadership, candor, and sensitivity, and we will all feel her loss deeply for years to come. I would like to offer my deepest appreciation for Dr. Foster's outstanding contribution to the Nation and send my sincerest condolences to her family and friends.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in Saturday's Washington Post business section there is a headline story: German Phone Giant Seeks U.S. Firm. The concluding paragraph:  
   But Hedberg stressed that a joint venture will not, under any circumstances, be considered as the means of crafting an offering for  multinationals: Deutsche Telekom wants full control of whatever course it pursues.  
   Accordingly, on behalf of Senators INOUYE, ROCKEFELLER, DORGAN, KERRY, and myself, we introduce legislation to clarify the rules governing the takeover of U.S. telecommunications providers by overseas companies owned by foreign governments. The original rules in this area were established by statute in the 1930's, and while the law has not changed, the FCC's interpretation of this statute has. 
   It is time to revisit this matter to ensure that current policy is consistent with efforts to promote vigorous domestic competition, maintain a secure communications system for National Security while meeting our International Trade Obligations. 
   The statute expressly prohibits the transfer of a license to any corporation owned 25 percent or more by a foreign government, but allows the FCC to waive this prohibition if doing so would be in the public interest. Unfortunately, the FCC in previous rulemaking has found that the public interest is satisfied solely on the basis of whether the foreign government owned company is based in a WTO country. If the country is a member of the WTO, the FCC assumes that the public interest standard has been met. 
   The legislation we introduce today will bar outright the transfer or issuance of telecommunications licenses to providers who are more than 25 percent owned by a foreign government. We would not be alone in taking this step. Governments across the globe have prevented government owned telecommunications providers from purchasing assets in their countries. In the last month, the Spanish government prevented KPN, the Dutch provider, from purchasing Telef&#243;nica de Espan 6a because of the Netherlands government's stake in KPN. They were not alone; the Italian and Hong Kong governments have recently thwarted takeover attempts by Deutsche Telekom, of Telecom Italia, and Singapore Tel, of Hong Kong Telecom, for just such reasons. 
   Recent comments by Deutsche Telekom are particularly disturbing. During a recent press conference in New York, DT's CEO, Rom Sommer, stated ``that the market cap of Deutsche Telekom today vs. any American potential acquisition candidate means that nobody is out of reach.'' DT is approximately 59 percent government owned, has approximately 100 million euros in cash and operates essentially from a protected home market. NTT, the Japanese Government owned provider and France Telecom, the French Government owned provider are similarly situated. 
   Since 1984, U.S. telecommunications policy has encouraged vigorous domestic competition. The modified final judgment and the 1996 Telecommunications Act are key examples of our efforts in this area. While our efforts to foster competition have benefited consumers, these efforts have depressed the earnings and stock prices of U.S. domestic providers. 
   But in ``Promoting competition'' here at home we may be facilitating the ease by which foreign protected players may emerge with key U.S. assets. So for example, regulated European monopolists Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, both majority foreign government owned--and subject to considerably less domestic competition, are reportedly eyeing U.S. companies. 
   For more than fifty years, U.S. international trade policy has encouraged governments to separate themselves from the private or commercial sector. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Government encouraged various privatizations of foreign government-owned commercial ventures. 
   With the end of the Cold War and the rise of global capitalism, we can justifiably claim an enormous amount of success in these efforts. Unfortunately, these efforts are far from complete. Around the globe, some of the world's most important sectors remain shackled with government-owned competitors. These government owned companies distort competition and undermine the concept of private capitalism. 
   To allow these government-owned entities to purchase U.S.-based assets would undermine longstanding and successful U.S. policy. Moreover, allowing these competitors into the United States could potentially undercut our efforts to ensure competition in our domestic telecommunications market and in markets abroad. 
   Government ownership of commercial assets results in significant marketplace distortion. Companies owned by governments have access to capital, capital markets and interest rates on more favorable terms than companies not affiliated with national governments. Many lenders may assume, correctly, that individual governments would not allow these companies to fail. 
   In addition, companies competing with these providers may suffer from increased costs as a result of the entrance of such providers into the market. Lenders may conclude that the difficulty in competing with a government-owned company will increase the likelihood of failure. As a result, the entrance of a government supported provider into a market raises troubling anti-competitive issues. Many of these anti-competitive effects can be relieved merely by the elimination of government-owned stakes. 
   Finally, with regard to foreign markets, it is troubling to permit companies to be regulated by the governments that own them. While there is little we can do to effect this situation, we can take care to see that it is not exacerbated. These companies may use profits from these anticompetitive markets to unfairly subsidize U.S. operations. 
   I must raise the national security concerns that trouble me greatly. We can all agree that telecommunications services are important for national security concerns. To permit a foreign government to own such assets would raise too many troubling questions. 
   The United States government--for national security purposes--created and nurtured the Internet in the 1960s and 1970s to ensure redundancy in communications. To permit foreign government owned companies to purchase the infrastructure necessary to support the Internet would undercut the very success of these efforts. 
   This bill is timely for one additional reason. In recent days we have seen an increase in European Union antitrust scrutiny in the telecommunications area. Much of that activity has focused on two high profile proposed mergers, WorldCom-Sprint and Time WARNER-AOL, despite the limited impact that these mergers will have on the European Union. This trend has become so pronounced that it received coverage in last weeks Washington Post in a story entitled, ``EU Resists Big U.S. mergers.'' 
   This increased antitrust activity is particularly troublesome because competitors to both companies are owned by European governments including the German, French and Dutch governments. 
   Moreover, several of these government owned companies are widely reported to be interested in purchasing the remnants of Sprint that may be separated as a result of this investigation. In fact, according to a recent Financial Times story, as a result of aggressive antitrust enforcement, a strong American competitor--MCI WorldCom may fall prey to one of these government owned-competitors. 
   For the United States Justice Department to take this step is one matter--these mergers involve American companies, primarily doing business in the United States. For the EU to take this step--when it is likely to assist European Companies owned by its member governments--is quite another. 
   Moreover, this is not the first time that the EU has intervened in a U.S. merger to protect European government owned companies. Several years ago, the EU objected to the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in order to protect the government owned Airbus consortium. 
   In conclusion, this legislation establishes all of the correct incentives. It does not prohibit foreign investment; rather, it prohibits foreign government investment. Many companies have expressed a desire to enter the U.S.; ours is a lucrative market. By encouraging additional privatization of the government-owned telecommunications providers interested in providing services in the United States we will further the ideals of international capitalism.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, here we go again, treating foreign trade as foreign aid, failing to compete, and giving away our technology and production. The permanent normal trade relations with China--PNTR--vote is not about access to China. The agreement doesn't provide open access, and even as a member of the WTO, China's market doesn't become open. Japan has been a member of the WTO for 5 years and her market remains closed. PNTR is certainly not about jobs in America, but about production and jobs in China. As headlined in the Wall Street Journal, corporate America is in a foot race to invest and produce in China. PNTR is not about exports. Today's $70 billion deficit in the balance of trade with China is bound to increase. 
   Nor will PNTR maintain our ``lead'' in technology. Already we have a $3.2 billion deficit in technology trade with China that threatens to reach $5 billion this year. PNTR is not about environment and labor. It took the democratic United States 200 years to get around to labor and environmental protections. Emerging countries, like us in the beginning, will sacrifice labor and environment to produce and build. PNTR is not about human rights. Human rights will be abused by a communist government in order to control a population of 1.3 billion. PNTR is not about undermining the communist regime in China. The communist regime knows what it's doing and unanimously favors PNTR. Finally, PNTR is not about China obeying its agreements, but the United States enforcing ours.  
   We are in a desperate circumstance. For 50 years we have readily sacrificed our manufacturing sector to spread capitalism and defeat communism. But our security rests as if on a three legged stool. The one leg of values is strong. America is admired the world around for its stand for human rights and individual freedom. The second leg of military power is unquestioned. The third leg of economic strength has become fractured. We have gone from 41% of our work force in manufacture at the end of World War II to 14 percent. Manufacture provides the salary and benefits that produce a middle class. This middle class is not only the strength of an economy, but the strength of a democracy. As Akio Morita of Sony stated: ``That world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.'' 
   ``Permanent'' is the objectionable part of PNTR. The issue is not whether we will trade with China--we will. But the annual renewal of our trade relations affords us an opportunity to once more get the attention of our leadership as to an impending disaster. It's not just trade. The U.S. influence in world diplomacy is threatened. The 6th Fleet and the hydrogen bomb are no longer a threat. Today, economic power counts. Money talks. The domestic market is the principal weapon in the global competition. We have the richest, but refuse to use it, all because of some nonsense that a trade war may ensue. We are in a trade war and don't know it. It shows the lack of understanding of the global economy, of the global competition. 
   To begin with, the global competition is keen. With the fall of the Wall, 4 billion people have entered the work force. With technology transferred on a computer chip, financed by satellite, one can produce anything anywhere. In the age of robots, skilled production is readily available. The most productive automobile plant in the world, according to J.D. Power, is not in Detroit, but in Mexico. Years ago as Governor, I was admonished to let the emerging countries produce the textiles and the shoes; the United States would produce the airplanes and computers. Today, the competition produces the textiles, the shoes, the airplanes and the computers. All countries have as a goal obtaining technology and producing technology. All protect their domestic agriculture. All, except the United States, protect their local market from foreign imports. And all, 
   except the United States, enjoy government financing. The European aircraft sold in the United States is government financed. The Japanese car taking over the United States market is financed and protected--and sold for less than cost. Most importantly, the goal of U.S. trade is profits. The goal of global competition is market share. While the competition cares little about a standard of living, the U.S. burdens its production with a high standard. Before ``Jones Manufacturing'' can open its doors it must have a minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, clean air, clean water, a safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave--and almost ergonomics. Corporate taxes in the U.S. are a cost of production; whereas, the competition's value added tax is rebated at export. The global competition saves while we consume. They willingly pay $4.50 for a gallon of gasoline but we go ``ape'' when a gallon reaches $2.00. The global competition is organized and directed. We are totally disorganized. There are 28 agencies and departments engaged in trade decisions and we have allowed the financing of our debt to control trade decisions. Former Prime Minister of Japan, Hashimoto, threatened one afternoon at Columbia University to stop buying our bonds if we insisted on enforcing our dumping laws. The stock market fell 200 points within an hour and the dumping law against Japan was not enforced. Finally, all countries in international trade use access to their markets as a bargaining chip. Refusing to compete, we cry, ``be fair; be fair; level the playing field''. Moral suasion has little affect in business. We continue to lose our technology and production. It has gotten so bad that the foreign corporation in a controlled economy now preys on the domestic bloodied from open competition. Volvo buys Mack Truck. Daimler-Benz seizes Chrysler. And the European Union denies the MCI-Sprint merger so the Deutsche Telekom can buy Sprint. 
   As the United States moves now to set the parameters of trade with 1.3 billion producers of agriculture and products, we need time. We need understanding. The $300 billion trade deficit, costing the economy 1% growth, must be reversed. The PNTR vote is not against China, but to get the attention of the United States. We need to set trade policy and start competing. We need to realize that we are competing with ourselves. In the early 1970s our banks financing foreign investment began making a majority of their profits outside of the United States. They organized think-tanks, consultants, and entities such as the Trilateral Commission to promote the ``free trade'' line. Corporate America, making a bigger profit on foreign production, changed from nationals to multinationals. The campuses, sustained by corporate multinationals, all teach ``free trade''. The retailers, enjoying a bigger profit on the imported article, shout ``free trade''. The newspaper editorialists, financed by retail advertising, exhault ``free trade''. And then there's the lawyer. One country, Japan, pays their lawyers more to lobby Congress than the combined salaries of all the Members of Congress. By way of pay, Japan is better represented in Washington than the people of the United States. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution provides ``that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations'', but this power has been forsaken to the multinationals and foreign competition. PNTR will only continue this outrage. Trade with China will continue. But the only leverage we have left with China, the only chance for Congress to assume its responsibility for trade, is this annual review. ``Permanent'' must be stricken from Permanent Normal Trade Relations. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate passage of S. 2327, the Oceans Act of 2000. The bill calls for an action plan for the twenty-first century to explore, protect, and make better use of our oceans and coasts. Its passage is, quite simply, the most important step we can take today to ensure an effective, coordinated and comprehensive ocean policy to guide us into the new millennium. 
   I thank my colleagues in the Commerce Committee for their support, in particular, Senators SNOWE, KERRY, and STEVENS, for their cosponsorship and their efforts over the last several weeks to bring this bill to the floor. Following in the Commerce Committee tradition with respect to ocean issues, this has been a bipartisan process. I also thank the other cosponsors of the legislation, Senators BREAUX, INOUYE, BOXER, LAUTENBERG, MURKOWSKI, LIEBERMAN, AKAKA, FEINSTEIN, CLELAND, MOYNIHAN, MURRAY, REED, SARBANES, SCHUMER, WYDEN, LANDRIEU, MURKOWSKI, CHAFEE, and ROTH for their continued support. Finally, I want to express my appreciation to the numerous industry, environmental, and academic groups who agree that the time has come for this bill. 
   Mr. President, it is critical that we enact the Oceans Act of 2000 this year as we pass through the gateway to a new millennium. The oceans are again beginning to receive the attention they received in 1966 when we enacted legislation to establish a Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton Commission for its chairman Julius Stratton) to recommend a comprehensive national program to explore the oceans, develop marine and coastal resources, and conserve the sea. The Stratton Commission's report and recommendations have shaped U.S. ocean policy for three decades, and resulted in the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under Presidential Reorganization Plan Number Four, as well as most of the major marine conservation status NOAA implements. These include the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. 
   Where the Stratton Commission performed its work with vision and integrity, the world has changed in myriad ways since 1966. Ocean and coastal issues are growing more popular day by day, but we are able to make the necessary headway to ensure they get the attention and priority they deserve. Consider the following quote from the National Research Council's report entitled Striking a Balance, Improving Stewardship of Marine Areas:  
   The findings of the Marine Board studies have revealed a strong interest in the nation's coastal and marine areas by present and potential offshore industries, coastal states responsible for resource development and environmental preservation of their offshore regions, and the ocean research community. Little has been done, however, to devise a comprehensive regulatory or management framework for current or future activities in federal and state waters or on or under the seabed in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The need for a regulatory and  management framework is likely to increase in the future ..... No mechanism exists for establishing a common vision and a common set of objectives........  
   Establishing an independent national Ocean Commission in the year 2000 could comprehensively evaluate concerns that cannot be viewed effectively through current federal processes or through privately-commissioned studies. These include concerns about providing appropriate priority and funding for critical ocean conservation and management issues, as well as whether the ocean management regimes that have developed over the last 30 years are duplicative and uncoordinated, resulting in costly or time-consuming requirements that may provide little incremental environmental benefit. 
   The essential elements of the legislation before the Senate today remain the same as the Committee-reported version, with further amendments to reinforce the importance of science in supporting the Commission's activities. The Oceans Act of 2000 would establish a 16-member high level national Commission, similar to the Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and report within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. The Commission members would be selected from individuals nominated by majority and minority representatives in both houses of Congress. Eligible individuals include a truly balanced group of experts representing state and local governments, academia, ocean-related industries and public interest groups. 
   The Act would become effective at the end of this year, enabling the current Administration to complete the interagency ocean initiative resulting from the hard work done by the ocean community for the 1998 International Year of the Ocean. It will also allow the incoming Administration time to evaluate the Commission nominees and make appointments. Once the Commission completes its recommendations to the President and to Congress, it will then be the President's turn to report to Congress how he will respond to these recommendations. As in 1966, the real work will begin after the Commission completes its report. History has taught us that Congressional support and participation is essential to ensuring the long-term success of this truly national ocean effort. We are off to a very good start. The current bill enjoys wide support in the Senate and from industry, conservation groups, scientists, and states, all of whom have sent numerous letters of support over the past several months. Most recently, we have received letters of support from the Chairman of the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, the fifty-three member institutions that are part of the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education, as well as fourteen major telecommunications and information technology groups. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is both appropriate and long overdue. By the end of this decade about 60% of Americans will live along our coasts, which account for less than 10% of our land area. I am amazed that in this era, when we've invested billions of dollars in exploring other planets, we know so little about the ocean and coastal systems upon which we and other living things depend. Large storms events like Hurricane Floyd and Hugo, driven by ocean-circulation patterns, pose the ultimate risk to human health and safety. El Nino-related climate events have led to increased incidence of malaria in some countries. Harmful algal blooms have been linked to deaths of sea lions in California and manatees in Florida, and we are still searching to understand their effects on humans. The oceans are home to 80% of all life forms on Earth, but only 1% of our biotechnology R&D budget will focus on marine life forms. Mr. President, the oceans are integral to our lives but we are not putting a high enough priority on finding ways to learn more about them, and what they may hold for our future. 
   The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the United States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly its security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for food and raw materials, its position and influence in the world community, and the quality of the environment in which its people live.'' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago. It is time to look towards the next 30 years. As a nation, we must consider the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and ensure the development of an integrated national ocean and coastal policy to deal with them well into the next millennium. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, It has been over 30 years since I set off on my hunger tour of South Carolina, where I observed first-hand the shocking condition of health care and nutritional habits in rural parts of my state. The good news is, we have come a long way since then. The bad news is, there is still much work to be done. Like the ``hunger myopia'' I described in my book  The Case Against Hunger, we suffer today from a sort of ``health care myopia'', a condition in which a booming economy and low unemployment rates mask a reality--that many Americans eke out a living in society's margins, and most of them lack health insurance. Ironically, as the stock market soars, so do the numbers of uninsured in our country, at a rate of more than 100,000 each month; 53 million Americans are expected to be uninsured by 2007. 
   The health care debate swirls around us, reaching fever pitch in Congress, where I have faith that we will soon reach an agreement on expanding coverage and other important issues. However, I see a need to immediately address the health care concerns of these left-behind and sometimes forgotten citizens. They cannot and should not have to wait for Congress to hammer out health care reform in order to receive the medical care so many of us take for granted. That's why I am sponsoring, along with Senator BOND, this amendment to provide an additional $50 million for health centers in this bill. Fifty-seven cosponsors have joined us in working toward our objective. I would like to thank subcommittee chairman Sen. SPECTER and ranking member Sen. HARKIN for their advocacy on behalf of community health centers. I look forward to working with them as the bill moves to conference so that we may ensure health centers across the nation receive the support they deserve. 
   While ideas about health care have changed dramatically, community health centers have remained steadfast in their mission, quietly serving their communities and doing a tremendous job. Last year, community health centers served 11 million Americans in decrepit inner-city neighborhoods as well as remote rural areas, 4.5 million of which were uninsured. It's no wonder these centers have won across-the-board, bipartisan support. They have a proven track record of providing no-nonsense, preventive and primary medical services at rock-bottom costs. They're the value retailers of the health care industry, if you will, treating a patient at a cost of less than $1.00 per day, or about $350 annually. 
   Let me emphasize that this measure is a cost-saving investment, not an increase in spending. Not only are these centers providing care at low costs, but they are saving precious health care dollars. An increased investment in health centers will mean fewer uninsured patients are forced to make costly emergency room visits to receive basic care and fewer will utilize hospitals' specialty and inpatient care resources. As a consequence, a major financial burden is lifted from traditional hospitals and government and private health plans. Every federal grant dollar invested in health centers saves $7 for Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance: $6 from lower use of specialty and inpatient care and $1 from reduced emergency room visits. 
   The value of community health centers can be measured in two other significant ways. First of all, the centers' focus on wellness and prevention, services largely unavailable to uninsured people, will lead to savings in treatment down the road. And secondly, health centers foster growth and development in their communities, shoring up the very people they serve. They generate over $14 billion in annual economic activity in some of the nation's most economically-depressed areas, employing 50,000 people and training thousands of health professionals and volunteers. 
   It should also be noted that community health centers are just that--community-based. They are not cookie cutter programs spun from the federal government wheel, but area-specific, locally-managed centers tailored to the unique needs of a community. They are governed by consumer boards composed of patients who utilize the center's services, as well as local business, civic and community leaders. In fact, it is stipulated that center clients make up at least 51% of board membership. This set-up not only ensures accountability to the local community and taxpayers, but keeps a constant check on each center's effectiveness in addressing community needs. 
   In South Carolina, community health centers have a long history of meeting the care requirements of the areas they serve. The Beaufort-Jasper Comprehensive Health Center in Ridgeland, the Franklin C. Fetter Family Health Center in Charleston, and Family Health Centers, Inc. in Orangeburg were among the first community health centers established in the nation. The Beaufort-Jasper Center was very innovative for its day, in the late 1960s, tackling not only health care needs, but related needs for clean water, indoor toilets and other sanitary services. Today, the number of South Carolina health centers has grown to 15. They currently provide more than 167,000 people, 38% of which are uninsured, with a wide range of primary care services. Yet despite the success story, a need to throw a wider net is obvious. Of the 3.8 million South Carolinians, nearly 600,000 have no form of health insurance. That means roughly 15% of the state population is uninsured. Another 600,000 residents are ``underinsured,'' meaning that they do not receive comprehensive health care coverage from their insurance plans and must pay out-of-pocket for a number of specialty services, procedures, tests and medications. 
   South Carolina's statistics are mirrored nationwide. The swelling ranks of the uninsured are outgrowing our present network of community health centers. Adopting this amendment will ensure the reach of community health centers expands to meet increasing demand. It is our responsibility to continue providing our neediest citizens with a basic health care safety net. What better way to do that than by building on a program with a record of positive, fiscally responsible results? Everyone can benefit and take pride in such a worthwhile investment.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate The Rev. and Mrs. Morgan Dukes of Summerville, S.C. who recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. During the past 50 years, Morgan and Marie Dukes have lived throughout South Carolina and in Washington, D.C. After Morgan graduated from the Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, the couple moved to Bath, S.C. where Morgan led the congregation at First Baptist Church. He served as Director of Religious Activities at Furman University from 1958-1965 and then as pastor of First Baptist Church in Walhalla. 
   In 1970, Morgan and Marie moved to Washington, D.C., where Morgan was pastor of Brookland Baptist Church and later joined the staff of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. For 15 years Marie worked as a secretary in the office of the Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. They returned to South Carolina in 1990 to assist homeless men at the Star Gospel Mission in Charleston, a position from which Morgan retired in 1997. Marie worked for 10 years as a realtor in Summerville. 
   The Dukes have accomplished a great deal in their 50 years of marriage and have enriched many communities in South Carolina and here in our nation's capital. Peatsy and I join with their friends and family, including their children Vicki, Betty Ann and David and granddaughter, Lauren, in celebrating this important milestone in their life together.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I will vote with against tabling Senator DODD's amendment which creates a commission to evaluate United States policy with respect to Cuba. Contrary to the opinion of some in this Chamber, this amendment does not represent a seachange in our country's position toward Cuba or the Castro regime. The Castro regime remains totalitarian and profoundly anti-democratic. My contempt for Castro and his despotic rule over Cuba has not changed; I remain committed to spreading democracy to our island neighbor to the south. As Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, I was a leading supporter of TV Marti and Radio Marti since their inception. Just last year as ranking member of this subcommittee, I fought a House attempt to ground TV Marti. I have supported spreading democratic ideas to the Cuba people during my entire career in public policy. However, much to my display and disappointment, our Cuba policy to this point has not yielded the desired results. As I look for answers that explain why this policy has failed, I believe creating a commission may provide the key to understanding. I want an expert panel to review our policy towards Cuba to search for the facts. Only then can we accurately determine what policy changes, if any, should be pursued. 
   Many of my colleagues will remember the revolution in Cuba and the overthrow of the Batista regime. I remember it well. I also remember the United States at the brink of nuclear war in October 1962. American U-2 planes spotted Russian ballistic missiles sites on Cuba and tested the resolve of the young American President to respond to the threat. Many Americans, including this Senator, were hardwired to despise the Cuban regime as a result of these two tumultuous events. 
   In the 1970s and 1980s the Cuban regime destabilized Central America with inflammatory revolutionary rhetoric and aided socialist movements in the region. Cuban revolutionaries exported their vitriol to faraway Bolivia and Angola in Africa. The national security risk posed to our shores by Castro during the Cold War was palpable and I challenge anyone who believes otherwise. The hardline policies that successive administrations put in place to counter and neutralize the Castro regime were a necessary and appropriate response to that risk. 
   The political landscape is very different now. Just today I read about our thawing of relations with North Korea. The Clinton administration has formally eased ``wide-ranging sanctions'' imposed on North Korea nearly 50 years ago. This is something that I did not believe would happen for many years given the security concerns on the peninsula and the heavy presence of the United States military. This action is curious to me especially given our characterization of North Korea as a ``rogue'' state. It was reported in today's Washington Post that Secretary Albright has replaced the ``rogue state'' designation with the less confrontational term--``states of concern.'' Maybe this explains our departure in policy toward North Korea. Regardless, we are engaging a country that has the capability to threaten the United States in ways that Cuba will never be able to do. 
   My support for Senator DODD's Cuba amendment is a vote for a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. This amendment is not flimflam election-year politicking. To the contrary, the commission makes recommendations to the next President of the United States and not the Clinton administration. The amendment provides for a commission composed of a dozen experts from a wide range of disciplines, half to be appointed by the President and half by the Congress. The commission will be bipartisan and should include heavyweights in American foreign policy--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and Howard Baker, for example--to provide distinction to the policy recommendations. 
   This panel would also make United States policy recommendations with respect to the indemnification of losses incurred by U.S. certified claimants with confiscated property in Cuba. Should we achieve the goal of political reform in Cuba, the United States government needs to prepare itself for the resulting confusion and complex legal questions. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The regime in Cuba has been constant for many years but nonetheless we should be ready for an abrupt internal political change in Cuba. To refuse to plan for a post-Castro Cuba, indeed the current endgame of American foreign policy towards Cuba, is myopic. We need to be prepared for developments in Cuba and this Commission is an important first step. 
   It has been argued that the United States is not on trial here, and that the Castro government needs a public policy review. I do not take exception to this but rather believe that the commission should look at changes for the Cuban government to adopt. As a Senator charged with making foreign policy for this country, I support this amendment because it provides our  President with a road map of how to achieve its foreign policy goals with respect to Cuba. The President can accept or refuse the recommendations, whatever they may be. It would be the President's prerogative.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the passage of the conference report on S. 761, the electronic signatures bill. This legislation was originally considered and reported by the Commerce Committee. The initial purpose of the legislation was to legalize the use of digital signatures for contracting electronically, mostly via the internet. The States for several years had been working on adopting a model law--the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (UETA)--which was to be adopted by the States for the purpose of creating uniformity. This process was to be akin to the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). However, a number of industries, most notably those in the high-tech field, felt that it could take years for all States to adopt the model law. Thus, they sought Federal preemption. Bills eventually were introduced in both Chambers. Senator ABRAHAM introduced the legislation in the Senate, and Congressman BLILEY introduced legislation in the House (H.R. 1714). 
   As noted, the Senate bill--introduced on March 25, 1999--was referred to and considered by the Commerce Committee. After holding a hearing on May 27, 1999, the committee reported the bill on June 23, 1999. At that time, we were advised that the general purpose of the bill was to establish a Federal temporary and backup law, so as to ensure the national use of electronic signatures until the model law was adopted by the States. 
   During the committee's consideration of S. 761, I indicated that I did not have a problem with establishing uniformity; however, because the legislation ultimately affects State contract law, I was concerned about preserving the right of States to adopt their own laws, given that States already were working on the adoption of a model law. In the field of commercial law, the States had a similar experience with the UCC. Thus, I saw no reason to prevent the States from adhering to the same process with respect to digital signatures. I made it clear to Senator ABRAHAM that I would not support the bill--in fact, that I would seek to block its passage--if the legislation did not preserve the autonomy of States to adopt the model law that they were considering. I also sought to make sure States were able to adopt the model law in a manner consistent with their consumer protection laws. Senator ABRAHAM and I were able to come to an agreement so as to ensure that the legislation, as reported by the committee, was consistent with these principles. The legislation was unanimously reported by the committee on June 23, 1999. 
   Once reported, Senator LEAHY worked to procure a number of changes designed to ensure the non-applicability of the bill to certain agreements, including marital and landlord tenant relationships. The legislation was passed by the Senate on November 19, 1999. 
   I should note that before final passage of the bill, I objected to its passage by unanimous consent because of the inclusion of language providing that the legislation applied to the business of insurance. I objected because that language was not in the Senate bill as reported by the Commerce Committee, but more significantly, I objected because insurance companies are regulated by the States. Because the matter had not been addressed by the Commerce Committee, and because insurance is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, I wanted some clarification on the issue, and assurance that the issue of State insurance regulation would be addressed in the legislative conference on the bill. Senator ABRAHAM, through a colloquy, agreed that the issue would be addressed during conference discussions. 
   The House bill--H.R. 1714--was passed last November as well. It, however, was more extensive, and severe, than the Senate bill. It did not provide regulatory flexibility to the States to allow them to adopt the model law in conformance with their consumer protection laws; it included provisions regarding Government electronic filing and record keeping--which was beyond the original purpose of the legislation; and provisions specifying the manner in which consumers' consent could be obtained for the use of electronic signatures. Reservations and opposition to the bill were heard from state officials and the consumer community. 
   These groups had a right to be concerned about the bill. The legislation, pursuant to its ``consent provisions'' would have allowed consumers to be easily induced into giving their consent to contract electronically, even if they didn't own or have access to a computer. In other words, pursuant to certain inducements by a commercial entity--i.e., through an offer that the consumer could get the product cheaper if he or she agreed to a transaction electronically--consumers could have been placed in positions whereby they walked away from a commercial agreement in person without any paper or documentation and potentially no means of accessing the actual contents of the agreement later, including any additional notices or disclosures they're required to receive with consumer purchases. With respect to the record retention requirements that states impose on commercial entities, such as insurance companies, the legislation, would have substantially undermined the ability of States to ensure that businesses retained important documents, such as financial statements and records, and that States retained access to those documents. 
   The conference discussions on the bill began between the Senate and House immediately after the Senate conferees were appointed in March of this year. Subsequently, however, the majority staff of the Senate and House began to convene among themselves. On May 15, the majority presented a draft conference agreement to the Democratic Members. After reviewing the document, I made it clear that not only would I not support the proposal, but if offered up, I would do all I could to kill the measure. I should note, however, that every other Democratic  Member of the conference--Senators LEAHY, SARBANES, WYDEN, KERRY, INOUYE, and ROCKEFELLER as well as Congressman DINGELL and Congressman MARKEY--in addition to the administration, opposed the measure. In light of this opposition, the majority Members, and the high-tech industry, knew they would not achieve passage of the proposal. 
   The problems with the draft include the following: 
   Similar to the House bill, it would have allowed businesses to induce consumers into signing and consummating contracts electronically even in face to face transactions. Consequently, a person could walk away from a major agreement without any paperwork. The actual agreement would have been e-mailed to the purchaser. In that situation, however, the consumer would have no way of proving that the document that he or she received by e-mail is the deal that he or she actually agreed to. Moreover, 
   there would be no paperwork on warranties and no guarantee that a person could access the documents if that person doesn't own a computer or doesn't have the proper computer software of hardware. 
   Additionally, the draft provided that after a consumer consented, in the event a company changed the hardware or software that prevented the consumer from receiving or reviewing the document, the burden would have been on the consumer, not the company to purchase the correct hardware and software. 
   The draft also included the onerous record retention provisions of the House bill. 
   After the draft was rejected by the Democratic Members, I suggested to my friend, TOM BLILEY, the chairman of the Conference, that the only way a bill was going to pass this year was that it had to be an agreement of a bipartisan nature. Given that Congressman BLILEY's bill was so far different from where most Democrats were, I knew that if we could come to an agreement, we could achieve a bipartisan measure. He agreed. I suggested that he meet with a group of Democratic Members and the representatives of the administration to develop a bipartisan draft to present to the conference. He agreed to this recommendation as well. Subsequently, his staff met with Democratic staff members and representatives of the administration and eventually constructed a bipartisan Conference draft. That document included major revisions of the consumer consent, preemption and record retention provisions. Those provisions provided significantly more protections to consumers and protections of state regulatory authority. 
   When the draft was first presented to the conference, there were objections. However, it led to a second bipartisan discussion between the Democratic Members, along with the Administration and the two Republican principals, Congressman BLILEY and Senator MCCAIN--who also recognized the need for a bipartisan consensus. Through the efforts of Senator MCCAIN, we eventually were able to agree on a final draft of the bipartisan measure. 
   I am proud to say that the final conference report includes major protections for consumers and the States. Does it include all I would have liked for it to? Of course not. However, it does represent a commendable effort by Republican and Democratic conferees to put forth a law that accomplishes the original goal of establishing a legal framework for the new digital world, while maintaining important protections for American consumers. I have joined with Senators SARBANES and WYDEN introducing an explanatory statement of the legislation, which details how the 
    bill affects consumers and State governments. I would, however, like to highlight a few important provisions:

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a group of students from R.B. Stall High School in Charleston, S.C. who recently participated in the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in Washington, D.C. They tested their knowledge of American constitutional government against 50 other student groups from across the country in a familiar format to those of us in the Senate--a congressional hearing. During the simulated hearing, students testified as constitutional experts before a panel of judges. Nineteen students, led by their teacher Karen Cabe Gibson, represented Stall High School at the competition. They were: Prerna Bihari, Amy Boller, Philip Brooks, Michael Brown, Adam D'Alessandro, Chad Gleaton, Mario King, Morwen Mansfield, Sharon Martin, Jackie Mixon, Katie Mixon, Thang Nguyen, James Nick, C.J. Parks, Shirkerah Robinson, Tamiko Robinson, Johnathan Tufts, Paula Weinreich and Toni Wiser. I commend these students for their impressive performance in the We the People . . The Citizen and the Constitution program administered by the Center for Civic Education. Their interest in the foundation of our government is refreshing and will prepare them to become active, responsible citizens and community leaders.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address one of the most pressing problems facing American consumers today--the constant assault on citizens' privacy by the denizens of the private marketplace. This legislation, the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2000, represents an attempt to provide basic, widespread, and warranted privacy protections to consumers in both the online and offline marketplace. On the Internet, our bill sets forth a regulatory regime to ensure pro-consumer privacy protections, coupling a strong federal standard with preemption of inconsistent state laws on Internet privacy. We need a strong federal standard to protect consumer privacy online, and we need preemption to ensure business certainty in the marketplace, given the numerous state privacy initiatives that are currently pending. Off the Internet, this bill extends privacy protections that are already on the books to similarly regulated industries or business practices, and requires a broad examination of privacy practices in the traditional marketplace to help Congress better understand whether further regulation is appropriate. 
   The introduction of this legislation comes as the Federal Trade Commission releases its eagerly awaited report on Internet Privacy. Released yesterday, that report concludes that Internet industry self-regulation efforts have failed to protect adequately consumer privacy. Accordingly, the report calls for legislation that requires commercial web sites to comply with the ``four widely accepted fair information practices'' of notice, consent, access, and security. The legislation that we introduce today accomplishes just that. 
   On the Internet, many users unfortunately are unaware of the significant amount of information they are surrendering every time they visit a web site. For many others, the fear of a loss of personal privacy on the Internet represents the last hurdle impeding their full embrace of this exciting and promising new medium. Nonetheless, millions of Americans every day utilize the Internet and put their personal information at risk. As the Washington Post reported on May 17, 2000:  
   The numbers tell the story. About 44.4 million households will be online by the end of this year ..... up from 12.7 million in 1995, an increase of nearly 250 percent over five years. Roughly 55 million Americans log into the Internet on a typical day. ..... Industry experts estimate that the amount of Internet traffic doubles every 100 days. ..... These changes are not without a price. Along with wired life comes growing concern about intrusions into privacy and the ability to protect identities online.  
   As Internet use proliferates, there needs to be some regulation and enforcement to ensure pro-consumer privacy policies, particularly where the collection, consolidation, and dissemination of private, personal information is so readily achievable in this digital age. Indeed, advances in technology have provided information gatherers the tools to seamlessly compile and enhance highly detailed personal histories of Internet users. Despite these indisputable facts, industry has to this point nearly unanimously opposed even a basic regulatory framework that would ensure the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet--a basic framework that has been successfully adopted in other areas of our economy. 
   Our bill gives customers, not companies, control over their personal information on the Internet. It accomplishes this goal by establishing in law the five basic tenets of the long-established fair information practices standards--notice, consent, access, security, and enforcement. The premise of these standards is simple:

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation introduced by Senator SESSIONS, S. 2581, the Historically Women's Public Colleges or Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act. 
   There were seven historic women's public colleges or universities founded in the United States between 1884 and 1908 to provide industrial and vocational education for women who at the time, could not attend other public academic institutions. These schools are now coeducational but retain some of the significant historical and academic features of those pioneering efforts to educate women. 
   Let me take this time to tell you about one of these schools, Winthrop University, located in South Carolina. Winthrop's history dates back to 1886 when 21 students gathered in a borrowed one-room building in Columbia, S.C. David Bancroft Johnson, a dedicated and gifted superintendent of schools, headed up the fledgling institution whose mission was the education of teachers. Winthrop has changed considerably since moving to its permanent Rock Hill, S.C. home in 1895, growing from a single classroom to a comprehensive university of distinction. The institution became coeducational in 1974 and assumed university designation in 1992. 
   Like similar institutions founded as historically women's colleges and universities, the Winthrop University campus hosts numerous historic buildings--buildings that are expensive to adapt and/or maintain for modern-day uses essential to public higher education in the 21st century. Also, like similar institutions, many of Winthrop's alumni were women of modest means who were unable to make the kind of substantial private donations that would have enabled the University to build a strong endowment throughout its history. Nonetheless, this campus is significant and is worthy of federal support to assure that its distinctive role in U.S. history is not lost.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and my distinguished leader, Senator BYRD of West Virginia, on this initiative. 
   You learn through experience. We had bitter experiences, as politicians, on the floor of the Senate during the war in Vietnam. 
   Someone tells me that the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, has taken exception to this particular amendment. I could only say to my distinguished colleague from Arizona that I feel very keenly, if I knew in 1966 what I know now about Vietnam, I could have saved or participated, let's say, in the saving of at least 40,000 of the 58,000 lives we lost. 
   It took McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, almost 25 years to admit it was a mistake. And the question arises in my mind as to how long it is going to take us to acknowledge that this, too, is a mistake. Mind you me, I am not for withdrawal. I think this is a deliberate initiative, well considered, and deserves strong support. Otherwise, I am 100 percent for the troops wherever they are. 
   The record will show that the last $500 million that had to be appropriated at the request of a general for Vietnam was made on the motion from the Senator from South Carolina. But I visited with those troops. I have seen, in a very short period, certain disturbing things in Kosovo. And to watch my friend, the Senator from Delaware,  dignify this mistake, and all the spurious arguments made, is almost amusing, in the sense that one of the things he says is ``to wish for a nation to be both ignorant and free, wishing for a nation that never was and never can be''--quoting Thomas Jefferson. He says if you look for Europe to be both Balkan and stable, it is wishing for something that never was and never can be. 
   I happen to agree, Mr. President. That is what disturbs the Senator from South Carolina with the positioning of troops who are there for battle and not as a police force. We are really ruining the morale of our troops in this kind of commitment, not following through. They were supposed to have been out in a year's period, gone from any kind of military deployment, and we were supposed to have had the substitution, of course, of the police force and the allies. It is a very weak alliance that has not put up the money. The chaos grows by day and the danger is in the morning paper. 
   We have five sectors in Kosovo. You learn very quickly that the Russians are not supportive, and that is why we don't have the police force. You learn from the briefings that the Greeks are not for this particular deployment. The French, comme ci, comme ca. It is intimated even by the Senator from Delaware that they are not in support. I asked the Brits in London later about their withdrawal of a certain area and they said they were too stretched. But more ominously, you will find on page A-18 of the Washington Post this morning an article entitled ``Russia Strengthens Yugoslav Ties.'' It says:  
   At the end of the two-day visit in Moscow today, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic praised ``cooperation" between the two countries. Russia granted Belgrade a $102 million loan and announced the sale of $32 million worth of oil to Yugoslavia. The loan comes at a time when the International Monetary Fund, whose activities are underwritten by U.S. taxpayers, is considering resumption of loans to Russia. 
   ..... Putin's policy is consistent with Russian sentiment toward Yugoslavia. Moscow opposed the war, considered the NATO bombing campaign illegal because it was initiated without the specific approval of the Security Council, where Russia holds a veto. Moscow views the war crimes accusations against Belgrade as politically motivated.  
   That is what the distinguished Senator from Delaware was trying to dignify. They called it the fifth column in the war with Spain. We have fifth columns, as I can see it, militarily deployed in three sectors. Russian troops take a man from Moscow, and while we can't get our own weak alliance to respond and come up with a police force to keep law and order, we find Russians can get hundreds of millions of dollars here to support Milosevic. This is a good deployment? I see a mistake. I will never forget there was a mistake in diplomacy. There isn't any question about it. I will never forget. I will quote what our friend, Henry Kissinger, said:  
   Rambouillet was not a negotiation--as is often claimed--but an ultimatum. This marked an astounding departure for an administration that had entered office proclaiming its devotion to 
   the U.N. Charter and multilateral procedures. 
   I could read further, but there is no question that what we have is not statecraft, but a mistake in a military plan. There isn't any question that they don't want to admit it publicly, but the Secretary of State thought Milosevic would cry uncle in 3 days. We didn't have any military plan to take over. In order to try to backstop some kind of support and say this is serious, and it is not a mistake--``ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing''--they tried to equate this with the holocaust. Come, come. We got briefed at the time. There were 100,000 Albanians living peacefully in Belgrade, where Milosevic was also living. This wasn't ethnic cleansing in the sense of a holocaust--to find a person of a particular race or religion and eliminate them. They weren't getting along. 
   Thank heavens we didn't send Madeleine Albright to Northern Ireland; we sent Senator Mitchell. He knows that in order to get persons and populations with differences together, it takes long, hard work, and no ultimatum. If we had sent the Secretary of State, she would have said you either agree to do this by 12 o'clock tomorrow, or we are going to start bombing you. So we got caught without a military plan. There weren't any grand troops ready--even to come from Germany at the particular time. 
   Let's say Milosevic didn't like the majority group down in Kosovo. We had all kinds of briefings to the effect that the differences were exacerbating, as they say, and what happened was they would kill a Serb police on the corner and then Milosevic would come and burn out the entire block, and that kind of thing. But when we started the bombing, we declared this a war zone. Brother, when you have a war zone, you have a right, title, and interest to clear the enemy. 
   So immediately Milosevic went to work, and that is what led to the million refugees spilling over the borders into Albania, Macedonia, into Montenegro, and anywhere they could. That was another mistake. There was a mistake, of course, when they called this a ``peacekeeping'' because there wasn't any peace agreement. 
   The brass in Kosovo, including the four-star general, General Shelton told me what happened. The Joint Chiefs resent me saying this, but what happened is that both sides ran out of targets. Milosevic had already cleared the area on the one hand, and we had run out of targets down in Kosovo. So we have peacekeeping troops there when there is no peace agreement. What happens? All we have to refer to is what others have said, not just what I saw. What I saw was highly disturbing--our American military deployed and a hunkered down containment. 
   They took us to a little town with a population of about 67,000 people. We were in the city. But we were guarding a block with Serbs, including a few families there. We had a GI at one end, a GI at the other end, and one GI in the middle to take them to the shopping market. They had that many more Serbs. So they took convoys of them up to Belgrade to shop. Is this peacekeeping? 
   The columnist said:  
   The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.  
   What do they say in the Washington Post? Michael Kelly says:  
   How safe is Kosovo, how secure? Safer and more secure than it was a year ago, but still, in any real terms, not safe, not secure and becoming less so all the time. 
   Human rights abuses and serious crimes continue to be committed at an alarming rate, particularly against members of minority communities, with virtual immunity.  
   I was briefed to the effect that it was 95 percent Albanian. 
   Let me quote further:  
   Meanwhile, as predicted, members of the theoretically disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army have emerged as leaders of a criminal mobocracy that is the real power on the streets.  
   That is who is keeping the peace--the KLA, and mobocracy rules the streets. 
   What did the GAO say? This past weekend, they gave the report to the Armed Services Committee.  
   ......little progress had been made toward creating peaceful, democratic governments committed to political and ethic reconciliation. 
   ......the former warring parties largely retain their wartime goals.  
   We haven't achieved peace. 
   Quoting further:  
   ......it also criticized the United Nations for failing to provide needed resources, particularly in Kosovo where an international police force has been slow to get off the ground. 
   ``......an escalation of violent incidents or armed conflict'' over the next five years, not just in Bosnia and Kosovo, but also in Macedonia and in the two remaining republics of the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro as well as Serbia.  
   We deployed American GIs in the middle of that mess, and they don't want to even discuss it. They don't want to bring it to a head. Senator WARNER and Senator BYRD want to bring it to a head. 
   Let's develop some sort of policy because we have a nonpolicy situation. 
   We have no real support from the allies, as I pointed out. The main thing is that the Russians are all deployed all around and are giving support to Milosevic. Of course, Milosevic is strengthened in Europe. 
   We heard from General Clark about how the Europeans felt so safe--not at all. 
   They had a very interesting story in Time magazine a month ago whereby Vaclav Havel had befriended his former Czech native, Secretary Albright, our Secretary of State. He wished for her to succeed him as the President of the Czech Republic. The only problem is  that 75 percent of the people in the Czech Republic are opposed to ``Madeleine's War.'' 
   This has been a mistake--in diplomacy, in military deployment, in peacekeeping, in getting up the support, and everything else. It hurts the Fed's policy. It hurts foreign policy. 
   We have a group going to Moscow at the end of this month that will probably call on President Putin. I don't have the unmitigated gall to mention to President Putin about Chechnya. ``Here, here,'' he would say, ``Senator, your country invaded the sovereign country of Yugoslavia and Kosovo without a United Nations 
   resolution, and on your own you just took over and started bombing because they wouldn't agree, and you are asking us about Chechnya?'' What kind of foreign policy do we have? 
   What kind of Kosovo policy do we have? What kind of military policy do we have? When are we going to admit that this is a mistake. 
   Secretary Albright says we are going to rebuild the infrastructure, and after we get the churches, the roads, the airports, the schools, and the hospitals reconstructed, and the industries, people will go to work, and they will hug and love each other. 
   Well, we have had 30 years of that in Ireland. From the time I met Martin Agronsky in a restaurant, as he came out after a 3-week visit in London, he said they would never get together for 30 years. And he was right. I have been to Northern Ireland. They have the hospitals, the roads, the airports, and the infrastructure, and they are not hugging and loving yet. 
   Apparently, according to the Senator from Delaware, a stable Europe or a stable Balkans was never and never will be. 
   I don't think this is the proper military deployment. We have to bring this to a head and acknowledge the mistake we made, and do the best we can. The best we can is to follow the Warner-Byrd resolution whereby we have the people behind us. 
   I will make one political comment. Governor Bush wandered aimlessly into this debate yesterday. If I were the President of the United States, I would never want troops committed in a deliberate fashion as these were without the support of the American Congress, the American people, and the Senate. 
   I would not want them to give me a basket case, if I were elected President. But I would want, by gosh, some requirement that we look at it in an objective fashion, and consider my military, my foreign policy advisers, and look at what was on the ground to see if it was worsening, as it is today. 
   We keep saying we are going to get rid of Saddam Hussein, Milosevic is going to fall, and Castro is going to disappear. When will we ever learn? 
   The Warner-Byrd resolution helps us to begin to learn so we can actually discuss this in an intelligent fashion. 
   The arrogance of America came out markedly in the comments of the Senator from Delaware--that were it not for Americans none of this could happen; not at all. I hope they get a European defense force. I hope they take over. 
   I voted in 1971, before the Senator from Delaware came here, to cut the troops in Germany back to 5,000. That was the Mansfield amendment. 
   Let's not say we are responsible for everything and anywhere, and that it only can happen with us. 
   I think they are going to have to take over. I think when they take over it will be dealt with properly. 
   I, again, thank the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from West Virginia. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right, though we are really debating the amendment of the Senator from Virginia. We knew, and we could see it. We went into the different parts of that debate. To get down to all of these extraneous things my friend from Delaware brings out is not the point at all. We are not trying to send a message to Milosevic. We are trying to send a message to ourselves; to our policy; send a message to the GIs out there that is not willy-nilly. General Clark said only yesterday that it could be 5 years. Come on. 
   Does he think we will keep America's GIs out there in Kosovo 5 years?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. And the timing of this, just when we were assuring Russia that NATO was a purely defensive force, we were admitting three new countries. We destroyed the overall policy. This was a mistake from the word go and they don't want to try to explain it; they are embarrassed to do so. 
   But the Senator and I can bring it to a head and we can develop a policy. They are running around politicking and traveling the world. But we have a serious commitment, and I don't want to have any GIs hunkered down there and afraid to walk on the streets, with the KLA in charge. Meanwhile, we are sitting back here thinking this is a wonderful commitment and America is keeping NATO together. No.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first commend the chairman of our Armed Services Committee. He has been to war twice. He served as our Secretary of the Navy. He has a conscience with respect to the GIs now deployed in Kosovo. That is the reason I rise this afternoon. 
   My chairman, ranking member, and former majority leader, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, has a little bit of laryngitis. He is feeling well. He is at the committee markup right now with respect to the Labor, Health and Human Resources bill in appropriations over in the Hart Building. He wanted someone to be able to respond. I understood the opposition to this particular amendment were on their way to the floor. That is why I came. Maybe the better part of wisdom would be to say thank you and there is no debate, and when we get in one, then Senator BYRD can speak for himself. 
   However, I share that concern for our troops, their morale and the deployment of a so-called peacekeeping mission. There isn't any peace. There isn't any policy. All we have to do is look at the record. The record shows best that we debated airstrikes and we were split down the middle, 58-41, March 23, under the Biden amendment. We had the McCain amendment deploying armed forces in Kosovo, saying let's go to war. That was May 4, 1999. It was tabled by a motion of 78-22. 
   The record shows, at best, we have a lukewarm endorsement, maybe favoring some airstrikes, but against taking the life of a GI. That is the military policy right now. With respect to diplomacy, the policy is one of a so-called multiethnic society, as I remember Secretary Albright saying. 
   I visited Kosovo shortly after the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee did this year. I was never briefed on the importance of a multiethnic society ..... maybe the region should be partitioned. But that isn't the policy of the United States. I tried to verify the multiethnic policy with all of our experts deployed there--the Army generals, the Navy admirals, and everyone else. I could find no support for any kind of multiethnic society in light of what was going on on the ground. 
   Here we have another Vietnam, not in the sense of deploying more and more troops, but actually having a military deployment in an impossible situation. Don't go forward, don't go backward, just stay there; we will send movies. It is sort of embarrassing to see our military hunkered down like chickens in a hailstorm at Camp Bonsteel and everybody bragging that we have wooden buildings and catwalks through the snow and we can get hamburgers at McDonald's. That is not for the GI, the one who volunteers to serve in the military. He is looking to be trained and go to battle for our national security. 
   To address these conditions that continue and languish is a reason I am confident Senator BYRD introduced his amendment, which is part of our bill. And certainly it is my feeling, likewise, that we have a responsibility here. 
   The other day we had the 25th anniversary of Vietnam. The Secretary of Defense said, almost 25 years later, it was a mistake. Are we going to have to wait 25 years to resolve Kosovo? Bosnia was to last 1 year. That policy has been going on for 5, 6 years now. 
   We just cannot willy-nilly go along with mixed policies. Of course, the clarion call for the Kosovo initiative was ethnic cleansing. At the time they were briefing us, they had 100,000 Albanians living peacefully in Belgrade. Milosevic lived down the street. Heavens above, this was not the Holocaust. Everybody confuses ethnic cleansing with enemy cleansing. When you start bombing somebody and you make that the enemy, an outright open warfare, then the other side has got the right, title, and interest to clear the area of any on the side of the enemy. More ethnic cleansing occurred after the bombing than before the bombing. Actually, it was enemy cleansing because Milosevic is a cagey fellow and a scoundrel and we all know it. He says to himself, whoopee, now I can go in there and get rid of the real Albanians 
    that have been giving me problems down there in Kosovo. And he did it. 
   That is exactly what was happening. The talk now is trying to deal with, ex post facto, a million refugees spilling over into Macedonia, down into Albania and back up into Montenegro and elsewhere. But the real spilling over and the cleansing was enemy cleansing. We are trying to talk about war and victory, trying to give dignity to a mistake. 
   No. 1, it was a flawed policy from the word go. We came in where there weren't any guys with the white hats. It wasn't the good guys versus the bad guys. Anybody who knows anything about Kosovo and this part of the world knows that both sides are really something else. I would not want an American to go to battle for either side. I  say that advisedly because it has been proven. When we went there earlier this year, what did we learn? Yes, there was violence upon violence upon violence. It was continuing. And 95 percent of the violence was being inflicted by Albanian on Albanian. 
   It is interesting to me to see here, recently, in The Economist, that:  
   The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.  
   Then going down it says:  
   At present, the Albanians can look to NATO for their security and to the U.N. for their administration, while many of them traffic in drugs and other contraband and generally profit from the legal limbo in which they live.  
   Peacekeeping? Where is the peace? Where is the peace? We are now saying we have a deployment for peacekeeping. It is an enforced cease-fire. 
   I was briefed by the brass in Kosovo. They said both sides ran out of targets. We hit all the targets we wanted to hit. We were even going up there knocking out the Chinese Embassy. 
   Of course, Milosevic had gotten rid of everything and cleansed everything he possibly could. What a wonderful war. We won. Now we want to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Come on, don't give us that. 
   We were there in the little town of Urosevac. The President visited that town at Christmas time. They had a big show. They had 400-some troops, and they all were hunkered down in the city hall. You could tell the 65,000 or 70,000 residents of the town were not friendly. We drove around and they glowered at us. They were in charge. We were not in charge of the town the President was in. We were not in charge of anything, really, in Kosovo. We have deployments here with walls around them, fences and everything else. We do not wander down the street or outside the compound. 
   Similarly, in Mitrovica, we have a GI at one end of the block, a GI at the other end of the block, and a GI in the middle of the block on a 24-hour, three times eight, 24-hour routine, guarding people going to the grocery store. 
   It's public knowledge what the reporter says in The Economist about this thing not working:  
   The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.  
   There are the soldiers in the peacekeeping force, having to spend 6 months away from their families. People hate to waste time. We, in the Senate, we love wasting time. There is nothing to do tomorrow and nothing on Monday. We cannot wait for November and the Presidential election to be over with so we can all go back to work. But the normal attitude is not to waste time and, you see, that is exactly what is happening in Kosovo. 
   I finally understood about the Albanians when I was in London and I met with one of the leaders of Parliament. He said the Albanians are bringing 14- and 15-year-old girls to Portsmouth and forcing them into prostitution. They have drugs all over England now. He said: It's the worst threat and problem that we have here 
   in England. He said: I never thought I would ever say anything good about Milosevic, but I can sort of understand his problem. 
   That is not to say Milosevic is a good guy, or the Albanians are all bad. But you generally get a feel for what is out there and what is going on when responsible people tell you: Look, all the Afghanistan drugs are coming up through Kosovo, and into Europe. Instead of keeping the peace, we are keeping the flow of drugs. 
   The GI with any common sense is saying to himself: Where is this peace we have here? We have one fellow who murdered another one but we had to let him go in 48 hours because we only had 93 slots in the prison and the United Nations had not supplied a police force. The United Nations had not supplied a court system. The United Nations had not put up their money for a prison system. 
   So we go right to the ultimatum. If this is diplomacy, let me quote none other than our friend, the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger:  
   Rambouillet was not a negotiation--as is often claimed--but an ultimatum. This marked an astounding departure for an administration that had entered office proclaiming its devotion to the UN Charter and multilateral procedures.  
   And on and on.  
   The transformation of Alliance from a defensive military grouping into an institution prepared to impose its values by force occurred in the same month that three former Soviet satellites joined NATO.  
   That is none other than Kissinger himself. In that light, I am glad we did not send Secretary Albright to Northern Ireland. We sent Senator George Mitchell instead. But under the Albright policy, you either agree by 12 o'clock midnight or we go bombing. Come on. This thing is afoul, amiss, and a mistake, and we don't have to wait for 25 years to know it. Those are my words, the words of the Senator from South Carolina, and not the words of the Senator from West Virginia. He will be glad at the first of the week--I am confident he will be in good shape again. He will explain it, no doubt, to everyone's satisfaction. 
   We all agree on one thing. With GIs deployed on account of our mistakes, we are going to give them every dollar necessary, every benefit, every support we possibly can. 
   We cannot possibly continue day in and day out in limbo with a flawed policy and act like it is a policy. It is a nonpolicy and a flawed policy and a mistaken policy. We have to somehow bring it to a head. 
   How do we do that in a deliberate, tactful manner? What we say is: Look, get these countries of the U.N. to support it. 
   Of course, we learned at the briefings that the Greeks were not for it in their sector. They did not like it. The French, are comme ci comme ca. The Soviets never were for it, and they do not adhere to us. NATO responds to Moscow. The Brits are pulling out. In one place they pulled out, 3 hours later a church was burned. 
   I asked our British friends what their reason for pulling out was and they said they were too stretched. We are stretched, too. We have nine peacekeeping missions. We have Kosovo, Sierra Leone, the Congo, and East Timor. There are four more we are going to be asking for. The GIs are given a policeman's duty in a totally hostile place where one cannot take sides and one has to defend oneself and not act like an authority on keeping the peace but, by gosh, keep out of trouble. 
   We are not in charge in Kosovo, nor is the U.N., nor is NATO. We have invaded a sovereign country without a full debate. We made that mistake in Vietnam. We have the feeling of responsibility. I understand the distinguished Senator from Arizona is very much in favor of Kosovo. I could have saved him 4 or 5 years in prison if I knew at the time I got to the Senate in 1966 that McNamara felt Vietnam was a mistake. 
   Come on. Are we going to continue just because we do not want to send a message to Milosevic? Do my colleagues really think that Milosevic does not know what is going on? He has already removed the opposition authorities in Montenegro. If he went in there tonight, what would we do? Nothing. He is corralling his support. Read this week's Time magazine about what the Air Force did not hit. I wish my colleagues would get a copy and read it because it reports we were misled in that particular briefing about how we destroyed so many tanks, so many planes, so many targets; we just ruined the country. 
   Our distinguished friend, the Secretary of State, said: Give peace a chance; it takes time to get the roads and the bridges and industry and the hospitals and the air fields all repaired. 
   I remember a visit I had when I first came to the Senate. I was at the Connaught in London having dinner with Martin Agronsky who had been behind the lines in Northern Ireland for a 3-week period. He came out in despair. He said: That crowd is never going to get together. 
   Fortunately, under the leadership of President Clinton and Senator Mitchell, there was a break last Friday, and, finally, the IRA says they are going to disarm, and it looks like it might work. 
   For 30 years, they have had the infrastructure--the roads, the bridges, the hospitals, the universities. I have been to Northern Ireland. Some sections of Belfast have better housing than my hometown. With all that infrastructure, the British troops are still deployed years and years later. 
   Is that the policy of the United States of America with our GIs? That  is why we rise this afternoon and are ready, willing, and able to draw some lines that are understandable that will develop into a firm policy. 
   If the U.N. wants to get in there, fine, but if they are not going to support it, then we have a problem. I will never forget the story about Vaclav Havel saying he hoped Secretary Albright could come back to the Czech Republic, her native land, and succeed him as President. He said the one difficulty was that 75 percent of the people of the Czech Republic opposed ``Madeleine's war.'' 
   Take a rollcall. Go up to the U.N. See how enthused they are about the nonpolicy. 
   Quit giving this patina of deliberation and positivity by 
   doing nothing and keeping the troops out there and praying like we all do that no one gets assaulted or loses a life at Bonsteel. We have an impossible situation. It is not going to get better in the foreseeable future. We ought to bring it to a head and certainly let the next President, whomever that is, have a 6-month period to review the mistake we made and say: Wait a minute, it was not a mistake. 
   I do not mind if they are right and I am wrong. I can tell my colleagues right now though, unfortunately, I think I gave the right vote when I opposed the Biden amendment. 
   I appreciate the leadership and the conscientious approach the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has given this responsibility. We are not trying to embarrass the President. We are not trying to take a political position. On the contrary, I have my GIs out there. I saw what happened in Vietnam, and I saw what happened in Somalia. If it had not been for the Byrd amendment, we could possibly still be there. 
   This is a similar call to arms politically for us to set the policy and do so in a judicious way. We all know they want to try to subvert it; they do not want to talk about it. With this crowd in Washington, you have to be on message: Let's not talk about it because it might get on to the weekend shows, and if it gets on to the weekend shows, it might send the wrong message to Milosevic. Bah humbug to Milosevic. I am trying to send a message to those fellows at Bonsteel. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as one would say on the bill affecting textiles, in the famous words of President Reagan, ``Here we go again.'' 
   This is about more than textiles and textile jobs. It involves the economic strength of the Nation. It involves its political strength. The middle class is disappearing fast. We talk about the digital divide. I want to comment on the disappearance of the middle class itself. 
   Let me go right to textiles. 
   I was a witness some 40 years ago relative to the textile industry. In that particular time period, 10 percent of America's consumption in textiles was going to be represented in imports. That was a threat not only to industry itself but to the Nation. 
   Specifically, I testified before the International Trade Commission. At the time, President Eisenhower was in office. We went by to see General Persons, his Chief of Staff. He said: Don't worry, you will win the case. But in June we got an adverse decision. 
   At that time, with that adverse decision, I went to our friend, Senator John F. Kennedy, a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, and discussed at length the particular problem. We agreed on an exchange of letters, so to speak, with me outlining the problem, and in turn Senator Kennedy outlining what he thought would be a solution. 
   We all know then, that Kennedy was elected President. Early in 1961, we had a conference at the White House. He said: In line with what I outlined to you in the campaign, I want it to come under the national security provisions of our trade laws. 
   So, hark, ye, all who talk and lament that we haven't passed a trade bill in 6 years. It is a good thing we did not pass one, because what we really need to do is get competitive and stop treating foreign trade as foreign aid. This is not a Finance Committee. This is a Foreign Relations Committee. It is a giving away the manufacturing backbone of the United States of America. 
   Under that national security provision to protect the textile and apparel industry, you had to have a hearing and a determination that the particular commodity, or article, or product was important to our national security. 
   I will never forget it. We set up the hearing with Secretary Ball--he was the undersecretary for Dean Rusk at State--Secretary Goldberg of Labor, Secretary Freeman of Agriculture, Secretary Hodges of Commerce. A few people remember that Senator Kennedy had a bipartisan Cabinet with a Republican Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Dillon, and a Republican Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara. 
   We had those five. We brought the witnesses. They made the finding that, next to steel, textiles were second most important to our national security. I remember the particular ``wag'' at that time, that, look, you couldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform. So we had to be able to make the clothing and the uniforms.  
   As a result, President Kennedy on May 13, 1961, promulgated his Seven-Point Program relative to the importation of textiles. 
   Mind you me: We feared at the time that 10 percent of America's consumption in textile products was being imported or just about to be imported. 
   As I look at the Chamber now, two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported--not 10 percent. With this particular conference report, there isn't any question that certain parts of the textile industry will immediately disappear, and the rest of it in a 4- or 5-year period will be on the ropes. 
   You say: Why, oh, why, Senator from South Carolina, are you objecting? Because the American Textile Manufacturers Institute is in favor of the conference report 
   That selfish crowd. I call them selfish in a studied way. I authored five textile bills that have gotten through this Senate. I had four of those textile bills go through the House and the Senate, and four of them were vetoed. I know from whence this particular Senator got the votes for these bills. Yes. It was the apparel group in America, the ones who make the clothing. 
   The little ditty is: We produce for America. We have the fine middle-class jobs, and we are working around the clock. And, yes, we are the most productive textile workers in the world. 
   The industry itself has invested some $2 million a year over the past 15 years, keeping up with modernization, with the best of machinery, the best of approaches in employment. 
   I have made many a sneak through and they don't want to let a Democrat in the plant. But I would sneak in on one floor and duck down into the plant on the bottom floor. It is totally automated in the weave room with the looms, spinning away. They used to have 115 employees, and now have only 15. They have cut back on the employees and put in the most modern machinery. The worker, the machinery, and the industry is the most productive. It is not a question of productivity. We don't have to get globalization and competition so we can make them productive. The politicians run around on the floor of the Senate and some of them have never worked for a living. They don't know what productivity is. 
   We have quite an opposition. Let me say a word about that. When we first started out, we only had, say, the Japanese Government, with their representatives coming in to talk. But soon after, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp made a majority of their money outside of the United States. 
   So, in addition to Koreans and Japanese, now we have the international banks. Along with the international banks came the international groups funding campus studies with contributions and they began to get the expert studies off the campuses with the consultants. So we had the banks, the universities, the consultants, and the foreign operation. Then, of course, we had the retailers. They wanted to sell a cheap product. So we had the National Retail Federation. They are the biggest supporters of the print media in America, the newspapers. They make their money off of retail advertising. So we have these editorialists, who never bit into customs or the trade practices, writing about free trade, free trade, free trade. 
   So we have the retailers. Then go to the book ``Agents of Affluence,'' published about 10 years ago. At that time, Japan was paying $113 million for over 100 representatives in Washington, DC, to look out for their industry, their game of market share. 
   This bill is all backed up. The white tent is out. We saw it in NAFTA. Only they are afraid to bring the tent down. They are meeting in the White House itself. They are all getting together and running around with the former Presidents, the former Secretaries of State. The former chairman of the Finance Committee, the distinguished ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN of New York said: When a freshman at City College of New York, I heard that corporations ran America. He was telling corporate America to get out and get the vote. 
   We had that crowd and we have my ATMI, which is my point. They don't know from ``sic 'em'' about competition. They know extremely well how we got the votes from Evelyn Dubrow and the apparel workers of America. That's how we passed those bills. The cloth manufacturers have divorced themselves from the apparel manufacturers and said: Fend for yourself. We've got a better offer and we are going to start free trade. It doesn't make any difference so long as we can get fabric forward. If we can get the cloth, we can sell it to them in Africa, in the Caribbean or in Mexico. We will let any trade bill go so long as we can sell. But fend for yourself. You are out of business. 
   Let me tell you how many jobs we have now that are bound to be gone because the States will be inundated. Alabama has presently 26,500 apparel jobs. Goodbye, Alabama. I want to see those Senators come here now. 
   California, 146,900 textile, middle-class American jobs, earning $8 and sometimes $10 or more an hour. Middle class--I want to emphasize that. Henry Ford said he wanted to make sure the person manufacturing his product was capable of buying it. So he put in the wage scale which allowed that and he started developing a strong middle class. 
   Florida, let's see the Florida Senators come here and say: 
   Free trade, free trade. Forget about the 19,700 apparel jobs. They are gone. Why? 
   Because of us, because of us as Senators and Members of Congress, setting the standard of living for industrial America. We say before you can open up that ABC Manufacturing Company, that what you need do, first, is have a minimum wage, then Social Security, then Medicare, then Medicaid, then plant closing notice, then parental leave, then clean air, then clean water, then safe working machinery, then a safe working place--or we sent OSHA after you. Republicans and Democrats all agree, before you open the front door, you better have all of that in the plant or you are in violation of Federal law. You are out of step with the standard of American living. 
   But if you can take off and get your T-shirts made in Bangladesh, you have none of those requirements, and pay one cent an hour. In Burma, it is 4 cents an hour. In China, it is 23 cents an hour. In the country of Colombia, it is 70 to 80 cents an hour. In the Dominican Republic, it is 60 cents an hour. In El Salvador, it is 59 cents an hour. In Guatemala, it is 37 to 50 cents an hour. In Haiti, it is 30 cents an hour. In Honduras, 43 cents an hour. In India, 20 to 30 cents an hour. In Indonesia, 10 cents an hour. Malaysia, $1 an hour. Mexico, 50 to 54 cents an hour. Nicaragua, 23 cents an hour. Pakistan, 20 to 26 cents an hour. Peru, 90 cents an hour. The Philippines, 58 to 76 cents an hour. Romania, 24 cents an hour. Sri Lanka, 40 cents an hour. Thailand, 78 cents an hour. 
   As you well know, 30 percent in manufacturing is your labor cost, and you can save as much as 20 percent by transferring your production offshore to a low-wage country. That is, maintain your executive office, maintain your sales force, but with a company of $500 million in sales, transfer the production to Mexico or a low-wage country offshore and you can make $100 million before taxes. Or you can continue to work your own people and go broke. That is the trade policy of this wonderful Finance Committee that runs all over the floor, bleating and wailing and wondering: Oh, what are we doing for Africa? Isn't this a grand thing we have for the Caribbean and everything else, with no regard to the reality. 
   They taught us early on, at the beginning of the war in artillery, no matter how well the gun is aimed, if the recoil is going to kill the guncrew, you do not fire. The aim is good. 
   I would like to put in a Marshall Plan for Mexico. It is a fine business. Let's help the Caribbean, let's help Africa, let's help anybody. There is hunger in the world so let's find it and help with it. But this crowd, wow, they are not going to pay for anything--nothing. They are not going to have any regard from whence they came and the strength of America itself. 
   Two-thirds of the garments already coming in are imported. In Georgia, there are 26,100 apparel workers; Kentucky, 18,900; Maine, 2,600; Massachusetts, 10,400; Mississippi--the distinguished majority leader said it is a wonderful thing. I want him to go back and tell these 16,600 apparel workers it is the last call for breakfast. 
   In my beginning days, they used to have that early morning program, the  ``Breakfast Club,'' in Chicago, the Stevens Hotel, with Don McNeil. They would get to the very end and they would say: ``It is the last call for breakfast.'' I can hear the music now. This is the last call for Texas, certainly the last call for the apparel workers, because they are gone. Goodbye Mississippi, 16,600 will be applying for unemployment compensation or going--where? I will tell you where they are going. I think we had a list from the Department of Commerce of these great jobs. I will tell you where they are. 
   You say: Wait a minute, Senator. How about that employment rate? We have such low unemployment. 
   Here is where they are going: cashiers, janitors, cleaners, retail salespeople, waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, systems analysts, home health aides, security guards, nursing aides, anything they can get that they can possibly do--for less pay, obviously. In fact, the retail workers, they found out you can hire them as independent contractors and you don't even have to pay for their health care. They have every gimmick in the book to squeeze that middle class here in the United States and bring them down to nothing. 
   So it goes, for New York, the Senators from New York, I want to inform them, advisedly, there are 74,700. There is no one I respect more, of course, than the senior Senator from New York and the senior House Member, my friend, CHARLIE RANGEL. But if I had CHARLIE here I would say: CHARLIE, 74,700: Going, going--gone. This vote is fixed. That is why we have this exercise here. 
   They talk about the most deliberative body. They do not call a thing until it is greased; the jury is fixed. Then, after you have gotten the vote of the jury, then you let them talk because it is all over. 
   North Carolina, 38,300; Pennsylvania, 34,900; South Carolina, 18,500; Tennessee, 23,500; Virginia, 12,900--those are the apparel jobs that are going, going, gone once we get this conference report voted on by tomorrow, I take it. It will go to the President. They will all stand around with big smiles in the Oval Office: Look what we have done. We understand humankind. We want to help sub-Sahara. We want to help the Caribbean. 
   Let me get right to the point with respect to the apparel versus the cloth manufacturers. As you well know, the manufacture 
   of the fabric itself is capital intensive, so that is why they have not caught up with them yet. But now they are beginning to build those facilities down in Mexico. So, as I said a minute ago, it will be about 5 years and then they will have their own fabric manufacturers down there shipping into the American market. Otherwise, all that fine Japanese machinery that we have in American plants, all of a sudden the price is going to go up. They know how to compete. Our trade policy is anything but reciprocal. 
   Cordell Hull said ``reciprocal free trade.'' My friend, the distinguished Senator from New York, gets with Smoot-Hawley and Cordell Hull and how we started the reciprocal trade agreements in the 1930s, and we have been for freedom. 
   Not so at all. No. The very Congress that passed the reciprocal free trade, historically they put in subsidies for agriculture in Montana--yes. Subsidies for agriculture in Montana, and protective quotas. Do not give me free trade for agriculture, you will not get my vote. No, sir, I am not for free trade for agriculture because our protections, our subsidies have made America's agriculture the showcase of the world. We feed ourselves and 15 other countries. 
   But wait until the China bill. I can't wait for that one to come. They are trying to sell the farmers a bill of goods. There are 3,338,000--go look at the record at the Department of Agriculture. There are 3,338,000 farmers in America. In China, they have 700 to 800 million farmers. They talk about the percentage of arable land. Do not be getting along with that percentage of arable land and everything else. We already have a deficit in the balance of trade in cotton with China. In wheat and cereals and corn and other feedgrains, we had a plus balance 4 years ago, with the country of China, of 440 million. It is down last year to 39 million. You watch them, in 2 years they will have a plus balance. They will be shipping us wheat. But you are going to hear these farmers out on the floor bleating--whoa, we have China free trade for America's agriculture. 
   So with the wrong facts they have to go to the Department of Agriculture and go to the People's Republic of China and see exactly what they are doing. Actually, they have a glut in the People's Republic of China in agriculture. They do not have the transportation. They do not have the distribution. They do have hunger. But mind you me, when they solve that transportation and distribution problem, then they will be feeding the world like we have been bragging. And the farmers will be coming up here again. 
   Like that Freedom to Farm, we gave them that sort of freedom to farm. They came up and got, I think it was, $7 or $8 billion last year. They are looking for another $6 billion here. You know that is the crowd that looks to me, the textile Senator, saying: Free trade, free trade, free trade, the whole time they are drooling at those subsidies, those protective quotas, you know; looking at me like something is wrong, that I do not understand how to be nice in this world globalization. 
   So here we go. Since NAFTA alone, we have lost, in the United States, 440,000 textile and apparel jobs--440,000. 
   I know in South Carolina we have lost 37,000 textile and apparel jobs since NAFTA. This is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Remember, we were going to create 200,000 jobs with NAFTA. Oh, we were going to do everything. We were going to solve the drug problem. We were going to solve the immigration problem. We were going to create jobs. And we have gone from a $5 billion-plus balance of trade with Mexico to $23 billion minus, a deficit in the balance of trade. The average Mexican worker has less take-home pay today than prior to NAFTA. It has not helped anybody, but they are talking now about NAFTA for Africa and NAFTA for the Caribbean. 
   I could get into that at length with respect to the disparity in tariffs, with respect to our own quotas. They are being phased out by 2004. 
   Let me go to the main thrust of my point this afternoon, and that is the importance of these middle-class jobs to the economy. I will never forget a seminar in Chicago in the early eighties with Akio Morita, the chairman of the board of Sony. He was lecturing about Third World countries, emerging countries. He said the Third World countries had to develop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a nation state. Then, pointing to me, he said: And, by the way, Senator, the world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. 
   Was Morita making some original observation? Not at all. Alexander Hamilton made the same observation to the British in the early days of 1789. The British corresponded with the fledgling Colonies and said: Now that you won your freedom, you trade with us what you produce best, and we will trade back what we produce best--David Ricardo, the Doctrine of Comparative Advantage. 
   Mr. Alexander Hamilton wrote a booklet. It is at the Library of Congress, if someone on the Finance Committee wants to read it. In a word, Hamilton told the British: Bug off; we are not going to remain your colony; we are not going to export to you our agriculture, our foodstuffs, our cotton, grain, indigo, our timber and iron ore and import from the mother country the finished product; we are going to develop our own manufacture. 
   The second bill that ever passed with respect to the National Congress, in which I am privileged to serve, the second bill--the first bill was the Seal of the United States--the second bill, on July 4, 1789, was a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 different articles. We started this economic giant, the United States of America, with protectionism. 
   Abraham Lincoln followed it in the building of the transcontinental railroad. They said: Mr. President, we can get the steel from England. He said: Not at all. We will build our own steel plants, and when we are through, we will not only have the railroad, we will have the steel capacity. 
   Roosevelt, in the darkest days of the Depression, passed import quotas on the subsidies for America's agriculture. 
   Dwight Eisenhower in 1955 put quotas on oil. 
   We have practiced, more or less, a protected trade policy--we have many  tariffs on many things still--while we have bleated: Free trade, free trade, free trade, and joined the chorus: I like fair trade; I like a level playing field. 
   Do not give me a level playing field. I want to trade to my advantage and my interests. Business is business, and the game is market share. The Japanese have set the tone, the practice, and the policy in the Pacific rim, and the Europeans are following. 
   Let's talk China. There is not a deficit in the balance of European countries. The European countries have a plus balance of trade with China. What do we have with this ``free trade, free trade''? We have $68 billion deficit and growing. That is not the most recent figure, but $68 billion is the most authoritative figure I can give right now, and it is getting worse every day. They know how to trade and how to administer. We actually export about the same to Belgium and Singapore than we do to the 
   1,300,000,000 Chinese in the People's Republic of China. 
   Talk about exports, exports, exports, and the wonderful agreements--we will have plenty of time to get into those agreements. They want to continue that so we will not have even a touch of sobriety. Give us one chance at bat to sober America up because America is becoming very anxious and very concerned. 
   The Nation's strength of security is like a three-legged stool: We have the one leg, the values of the Nation, and that is unquestioned. The people the world around admire the United States of America. We have stood for years on end for individual rights, human rights, and democracy. I can talk on that because I am so proud of this country. 
   The second leg is the military, which is also unquestioned. 
   The third leg is the economic leg that has been fractured in the last 50 years and needs refurbishing, strengthening, and rebuilding. I say fractured, I emphasize intentionally fractured. 
   I heard the distinguished Senator from Iowa say, since 1945, look at the commerce, the commerce, the commerce. We were just like England in 1789. We had the only industry, the only production. In 1945, Europe was devastated and the Pacific rim was devastated. We were looking for customers. We were looking for buyers. We had production. Yes, we said free trade, free trade. Concurrent with that, we instituted the Marshall Plan and sent the money. We instituted along with that plan the machinery and the expertise. We sent it overseas in the contest between capitalism and communism, and it has worked. After 50 years, we can stand proudly and say it has worked. Capitalism has defeated communism. We are all proud of that and the sacrifice that went along with it, because in those days of 1945 we were willing to sacrifice. Today, we are not willing to sacrifice to save America itself--the middle class and the economic strength of our society. 
   What happens is we have been engaged in this for some time and, as a result, we have treated foreign trade as foreign aid. I think of Akio Morita and losing manufacturing capacity. In 1945, we had 41 percent of the workers in the United States engaged in manufacturing. In the year 2000, we are down to 14 percent. 
   In the nineties, in the United States, we have lost some 779,000 manufacturing jobs and in South Carolina, my State alone, some 40,500. The industrial strength is fast diminishing. 
   I look at the different things about textiles, but I look also at the ratios of imports to consumption and what we are going to manufacture for ourselves. Let's see. 
   As a young Governor, they looked at me at that hearing I told you about, at the very beginning, and said: Governor, what do you expect them to make? Let them make the shoes. Let them make the clothing. And we will make the airplanes and the computers. 
   My problem today is, they are making the shoes, they are making the clothing, and they are making the airplanes and the computers. And so it is. 
   Certain industrial thermal-processing equipment, 48.9 percent--almost half of what we consume is imported--67 percent of textile machinery and parts used in the United States we have to get from abroad; 55.3 percent of the machine tools for metal forming and parts; 51.9 percent of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and robotics--we import it. 
   I remember one good thing President Reagan did was to put in SEMATECH. He saved Intel microprocessing. Everybody is running around here falling over each other after that Silicon Valley money: high tech, high tech. We have somebody here from high tech. Bill Gates walks around convicted of violating the Sherman antitrust law but you would think he is a visiting potentate. All the little staffers and Senators streaming behind him as he goes through the Halls. And then I go to another policy meeting, and they announce we have another microprocessing, high tech, Silicon Valley. 
   Let's get right to the point. Microsoft has 20,000 employees in Seattle and Boeing of Seattle has approximately 75,000. They are in the manufacturing. General Motors has 250,000. Mind you me, they are not satisfied in high tech. They want to do away with the income tax, the capital gains tax, the estate tax. They want to do away with 200 years of State tort law--Y2K. They want to do away with the immigration laws because--why?--they can import the Indians and the Filipinos in here next to nothing. 
   Generally speaking, America Online has a service center now in the Philippines. Call them and ask them. My light bill in South Carolina is run through India. But high tech, high tech--they are all in a heat to see. Who is fooling whom. They are after the money. High tech is after the exemptions. They do not want to pay their wage. So there you go. 
   Right to the point, why do you think that the march in Seattle--I am not talking about the crazies who came up there from Eugene, OR, and broke up the town; I am talking about the march in Seattle in December; the AFL-CIO, the responsible individuals--that march was led by Boeing machinists. Why? Read Bill Greider's book ``One World, Ready or Not'' and you will see that much of that Boeing 777, before it can be sold in downtown Shanghai, has to be made in downtown Shanghai. So they are taking the airplane jobs there. 
   Or pick up the morning paper and you will see the automobile jobs in China that are being taken from us. All the time I have to hear that nauseating chant: free trade, free trade. Yes, I am for free trade. All the interviewers. GE owns NBC. The president of GE, Jack Welch, told everybody to go down to Mexico: All you suppliers, you aren't going to be a GE supplier because I can get it cheaper. I will show you that article in ``Business Week.'' 
   Let's go right down to boilers and turbines; 44.4 percent of what we consume has to be imported; electrical transformers, 43.2 percent; aircraft engines and gas turbines, 70.3 percent; motorcycles, 48.5 percent; aircraft, 45.7 percent--we used to have 100 percent of that business--office machines, 47.2 percent; microphones, loud speakers, audio amplifiers, and combinations thereof, 77.9 percent; tape recorders, tape players, video cassette recorders, turntables, compact disc players, 100 percent; radio transmission and reception, 57.9 percent of what we consume--used to be made by middle-class America; no longer--television 
   apparatus, including cameras, camcorders, and cable apparatus, 68.5 percent. 
   I remember when Zenith had their case, and their competitors had been found in violation for dumping. And the International Trade Commission in a unique decision held for Zenith--because they usually cancel out the trade administration--but the trade commission exacted the penalty. And the last stop, of course, was in the White House, in the Oval Office, where the President had the authority to cancel it out. 
   The Cabinet all around the table, they all voted to enforce the decision of the International Trade Commission. And in walked President Reagan. He said: I just talked to Nakosone and we are not going to do that. 
   You see, yes, it has been wonderful. It has been fine. It has worked. We have peace in the world--whatever--and we have a booming economy. But in a booming economy, you have to look at the consummate, the concurrent effect here. 
   Electrical capacitors and resistors, 69.5 percent; automatic data processing machines, 51.6 percent.  
   I read this because colleagues in the Senate say: There he goes again on textiles. I have given up on textiles. I resign. I quit. When the ATMI tackles me from behind, and they leave out the people who have been getting the votes--the polls all taken--poor old Jay Mazur, poor Evy Dubrow, and the rest of them--and unit, and the others who have been working together--Seth Bodner, the knitwear folks, the apparel folks--I just have to say it is gone. This bill is passed. 
   But while it passes, we have to have a stop, look, and listen at the crossing and realize that 62.2 percent of clocks and timing devices that we use in America are now imported; watches, 100 percent--apparently we do not manufacture them anymore--drawing and mathematical calculating and measuring instruments, 71.4 percent; luggage, handbags, and flat goods, 79.7 percent; musical instruments and accessories, 57.2 percent; umbrellas, whips, riding crops, and canes, 81.1 percent; silverware, 59.9 percent. We can go to precious jewelry, which is 55.8 percent imported. 
   They have different clothing and all--sweaters, 76.4 percent; robes, nightwear, and underwear, 68.8 percent--right on down the list.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. It has 84.2 percent on footwear. So 85 percent of the shoes on the floor here in the Senate Chamber are imported.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is one little reading of the U.S. deficits in advanced technology because you know we have gone, they say, from manufacturing to high tech. 
   They told England at the end of World War II: Don't worry. Instead, of a nation of brawn, you are going to be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products, you will provide services. Service economy, service economy is the chant. And then, instead of creating wealth, you are going to handle it and be a financial center. 
   England has gone into an economic hand basket. They have a bunch of just scandal sheets--the newspapers and Parliamentarians--debating and shouting at each other. Downtown London is an amusement park. 
   Are we going that way, too? They have gone out of business there. 
   Here are some deficits in advanced technology products. Parts of the advanced machinery incorporated, $18.23 billion; hard disc drive units, $9.72 billion; parts of turbojet or turbo propeller engines, $4.28 billion, 
   Turbojet aircraft engines, $3.74 billion deficit, balance of trade; parts for printers, $3.52 billion; new turbo fan planes, non-military, $3.23 billion; cellular radio telephones, $3 billion; video cassette and cartridge recorders, $3.32 billion, deficit; display units, $1.64 billion; optical disc players, $1.64 billion; camcorders, $1.09 billion; digital still-image video cameras, $1.07 billion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we are worried. We have anxiety. There is fear in the land, Mr. President. The foreign holdings as a percent of the total publicly held debt--as we pay down the public debt, the foreign holdings are still at 40.3 percent, according to the Treasury Department. When you get these deficits, billions and billions--$347 billion in the balance of trade--so many dollars out in foreign holdings, the dollar falls, the interest rates go up, the stock market goes down, and recession sets in. Who is talking about it? Everybody but us in public service. We are running around, ``I've got class size,'' ``I've got a better class size.'' ``No, I've got charter schools.'' ``No, I got a better plan here on health care.'' ``No, your plan is no good.'' 
   They are not talking about paying the bill so that we can keep the country and the economy booming. They are talking about little peripheral things over here--campaign finance and otherwise--not paying the bill and reestablishing confidence in America. 
   The number of workers, as I have said at the very beginning, quoting Morita, is down to 14 percent in manufacturing. I will read an excerpt from Mr. Eamon Fingleton, Mr. President, entitled ``The Unmaking of Americans.'' I want everyone to listen because we have books by professors at Harvard and out at Berkeley in California and Stephen Cohen and John Zysman who have written ``Manufacturing Matters.'' They are trying to wake up a dormant Finance Committee that seems not to understand anything about trade, who really think this is a good bill. I am embarrassed for them because this is not going to just put out some 74,700 apparel workers up in New York, but at least 18,500 that I have in South Carolina and, ultimately the textile industry--as soon as they can afford the machinery and get it in down in Mexico and these other places. I will never forget 10 years ago when we debated textiles. Macao had millions and millions of dozens of shirts and didn't have a shirt factory. China was transhipping them through Macao. So now China takes this sub-Sahara bill that will make a few people rich, but not the African countries or the African people, just as those shirts didn't make Macao any richer. China will transship right on through sub-Sahara Africa and, in the process, get rid of the American apparel workers and, before long, the textile workers. 
   Let's quote Mr. Fingleton here as to the importance of manufacturing and you will get a better grasp of this:  
   In recent decades, it has become increasingly fashionable for American opinion leaders to belittle the economic importance of manufacturing. If we are to believe such prophets of the New Economy as commentator Michael Rothschild and Megatrends author, John Naisbitt, manufacturing is now a distinctly second-rate activity that should take a backseat to post-industrial businesses like software writing and moviemaking. Their opinions are increasingly endorsed by pundits in everything from the Wall Street Journal to Wired. 
   It is time this view was challenged. The truth is, it is a highly dangerous myth that is rapidly weakening the United States' ability to lead the world economy. Not only do those who advocate post-industrialism--let's call them post-industrialists--overestimate the prospects for information-based products and services, they greatly underestimate the prospects for manufacturing. 
   When the post-industrialists talk about manufacturing, it is clear they are referring mainly to such unsophisticated activities as the snap-together assembly work carried out  in the television-set factories of the developing world. By implicitly defining manufacturing in such disparaging terms, they set up a straw man--for there is no question that, in an increasingly integrated world economy, most types of assembly work are so labor intensive that they can no longer be conducted profitably in high-wage nations like the United States. Overlooked by the post-industrialists, however, is the fact that assembly is only the final stage in the production of modern consumer goods. Earlier stages are typically much more sophisticated--the making of advanced components such as laser diodes, liquid crystal displays, lithium-ion batteries and flash memories, for example. Then there is the production of the high-tech materials that go into such components. Semiconductor-grade silicon manufacturing, for instance, is concentrated mainly in such high-wage nations as Japan and Germany.  
   We have a $74 billion deficit in the balance of trade with Japan, Mr. President. I think it is $28 billion deficit with Germany.  
   And still more sophisticated than the fabrication of such components and materials is the manufacture of the production machinery used in the process. Perhaps the iconic example of such machinery is the stepper--the highly precise lithographic device that prints circuit lines on silicon chips. 
   Manufacturing components, materials and production machinery is generally both know-how-intensive and capital intensive. As such it can be conducted effectively only in the world's richest and most advanced economies--and workers engaged in such work are thereby shielded from low-wage competition from developing nations. The United States once dominated this type of production, but these days, as is abundantly clear from the nation's mounting trade deficits with Japan and Germany, it is at best an also ran. In steppers, for instance, GCA, the once world-beating American player, closed its doors in 1993, leaving the field almost entirely to Japan's Nikon and Canon and Europe's ASM. In high-tech materials, the United States is now similarly dependent on imports. And in crucial new components such as laser diodes and liquid crystal displays, the country was never a contender in the first place.  
   I remember the gulf war and the flat-panel displays we got from Japan for our defense work. 
   It is really discouraging to this particular Senator when we mark up the defense appropriations bill. We have in there a Buy-America provision trying to maintain steel ball bearings for Ohio and South Carolina because Timken and others produce them. They do an outstanding job. But we have those who put in an amendment to strike that out--that it is un-American and all. 
   I don't know where they got this idea about what America is--that we are supposed to meet a referee in bankruptcy, dissolve the assets, and send it around to the Caribbean, to sub-Sahara, and everything else on the premise that it is good policy for us to sometime come to the help of these particular countries. It would be good if it were not destroying us in the making.  
   Manufacturing's most obvious advantage is that it creates an excellent range of jobs. Whereas post-industrial businesses like software and financial services tend to recruit mainly from the cream of the intellectual crop, manufacturing harnesses the skills of everyone from ordinary factory hands to the most brilliant scientists and the most capable managers. In fact, as the late Bennett Harrison of New York's New School (a longtime TR columnist) pointed out in his book Lean and Mean in 1997, unskilled workers ``barely off the farm'' can readily be trained to operate computer-controlled presses and similarly sophisticated production machinery. In Harrison's terms, today's high-tech production machinery is not ``skill-demanding'' but ``skill-enabling.''  
   Let's emphasize that. It is ``skill-enabling,'' because the Senator from South Carolina is a witness. We brought in BMW, the automobile manufacturer, from Munich, Germany. It is in Spartanburg. It has 2,000 employees, and it will have this time next year hopefully 1,000 more. They were supposed to get another facility down in Mexico. They learned. They said: Wait a minute. The productivity of these people just off the farm, and otherwise skilled workers, can produce, and they have been producing.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we need to remember we are not only going to lose 74,700 apparel jobs in New York but in apparel manufacturing throughout the United States. 
   I want to go to the morning paper because they had a big conclave over at the White House. It says, ``Political Heavyweights Pull for Agreement with China.'' They have Vice President GORE and former President Carter. But they also have the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. 
   Quoting from this morning's Los Angeles Times:  
   Clinton asked rhetorically, ``Why are we having this debate?'' His answer: Because people are anxiety ridden about the forces of globalization, or they are frustrated over the human rights record of China, or they don't like all the procedures of the WTO. President Clinton's answer to ``Why are we having this debate?''--``Because people are anxiety ridden about the forces of globalization.''  
   The legacy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt--I will have to talk about a proud Democrat. I hope the distinguished Ranking Member doesn't mind me doing that. I think in time I might get him to join. I watched his votes, and he is very sensitive to the needs of little people. The great legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is: ``All we have to fear is fear itself.'' 
   I can hear him now. We had a little headset in 1933. That is before daddy went broke. He had a flourishing business. Amongst other things, he printed and delivered paper bags. But he printed the names of the German grocery stores all around Charleston: Hoffmeyer, Meyers, Hochwanger, Heiselmeier, Fahler, Reumeyers--I can see them all now. They called my father and said: Bubba, no use sending those bags to people who are not paying the grocery bill, and we can't pay you for the bags. He said: Well, got your name on them. I can't use them otherwise. Just do what you can. I am sending them around. 
   But we had at that time in 1933 a headset. I can hear President Roosevelt. 
   I had the pleasure of seeing him as a youngster in 1936 when he came through Charleston and boarded the ship. He came by train from Washington to Charleston, boarded the cruiser, and went on down to Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was looking up at President Roosevelt. 
   Later, of course, when I was a senior cadet at the Citadel, ready to go off into the invasion of North Africa, I could hear him in 1941 about the ``four freedoms.'' He said the four freedoms are the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom from want, and the freedom, Mr. President, from fear. That was the legacy. That was the legacy of the greatest President of our time. 
   Now what is our legacy? I can tell you. You do not have to get politician HOLLINGS or get the business leadership. 
   What is the business leadership? 
   ``Backlash: Behind the Anxiety Over Globalization.'' 
   The legacy of President Clinton is a legacy of fear. This crowd had better wake up and understand it because we are going out of business. 
   The President just last week was down in Charlotte talking about the digital divide, the digital divide, middle America. 
   How in the world can they buy a computer? Not the poor; middle America can't afford that. They are trying to hold onto a job. They are trying to pay for the house upkeep. They are trying to buy the clothes. And they are doing pretty good. But they look at those 37,000 from South Carolina who are gone, gone. 
   Washington is telling all of middle America that they never had it so good. We got a boom. Let's get the boom going. They see these jobs going, and they see all of our good friends, the immigrants, with fine business earnings coming in and taking a lot of the jobs. They see plant closings in Columbia. That is the way it is factored in. 
   I always loved to go to Ireland. But in Ireland, they have a 
   booming business taking care of all the banking and insurance accounts and everything else. 
   What do we do? We got rid of what Henry Ford created, and that is the middle class. Ford said, in the early days, I want to make sure that the individual producing this automobile is making enough money to buy it. That, along with the labor movement in America, got health care, retirement benefits, and everything elsewhere which they could pay for--not only pay for their home but send their kid to college, maybe get a little home at the beach or in the mountains, buy a boat to put out in the lake and go fishing, something for retirement. 
   They talk about Social Security. I see that fellow, Morris, is telling Bush: Don't try to talk about. Don't touch Social Security. Why? Because it is supersensitive because of fear--the legacy of the Clinton administration. He  has no idea about the digital divide and no idea about trade. That boy from Arkansas has gone up there and seen the bright lights in New York. He has left us. I can tell you right now, he is not looking out for middle America. 
   ``The best political community is formed by citizens of the middle class,'' said Aristotle in 315 B.C. 
   It is to the middle class we must look for the safety of England, says Thackeray. 
   In England, what we call the middle class is in America virtually the Nation. 
   In the 1880s, Matthew Arnold: ``The upper class is our nation's past, the middle class is its future.'' 
   I don't know about a future. 
   That is what is worrying the Senator from South Carolina--not the textile jobs. They are gone. They are leaving them fast, including one closed just last week. The best of operators are closing. 
   I can see it, and I know what is going to happen to the textile manufacturer. It will be totally gone. As soon as they can afford the machinery in Mexico and the Caribbean, they will print the cloth and these fellows will take their money and run. That is what you have in ATMI. That is why I warn everyone, we are not just getting rid of the textile jobs. 
   I said at the beginning we learned in the artillery, no matter how well the aim, if the recoil is going to kill the gun crew, don't fire. 
   You got a good aim, no question. Let's do something for the Caribbean. Let's do something for Africa. But on this score, where two-thirds of the clothing is already imported, let's not kill off the apparel industry. There are 74,700 jobs in New York, 18,500 in South Carolina, 146,900 in California. We will have a candidate saying: Boom, boom, boom, wonderful economy. 
   This is what he ought to be talking about. We have to rebuild the economic strength of this Nation. That is not going to happen at the present rate. This conference report ought to be sent back to the conferees and we ought to put in a competitive trade policy. 
   I had a bill with the Finance Committee 15 years ago. I have talked to the distinguished chairman not only about a value-added tax to pay the bill but I have talked about a correlation and coordination. There are 28 Departments and Agencies in trade. When we think that Commerce has it, they say no; in Agriculture, that is a farm product, and they say, no, the final say is over at Treasury Department. Why? Because 40.3 percent is foreign owned, foreign holdings, a percent of total of the privately-held public debt. Talk about paying down the public debt; foreign holdings as a percent is already up to 40.3 percent. When we are ready to enforce a dumping provision against Japan, they say: We are not going to buy your T-bills. And Treasury calls up and says that hearing was good. The tail is wagging the dog and corporations. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, as a freshman at City College of New York, said that they taught him corporations run America. They have preempted trade policy. We representatives, Senators and Congressmen, don't have any say. It is fixed with the White House. The corporations come around and fix the vote. By the time they call, nobody is on the floor and they couldn't care less. Let them puff and blow, the middle class be gone, the textile industry be gone, they are all Republican anyway. Now the apparel workers, the owners--the apparel workers are Democrat, anyway, so they would just as soon get rid of them. We will lose 26,000 apparel workers in Alabama, 19,700 in Florida, 26,100 in Georgia, 18,900 in Kentucky, 2,600 in Maine, 10,400 in Massachusetts, Mississippi loses 16,600, New York loses 74,700, North Carolina loses 38,300. 
   Imagine the President in Charlotte, NC, last week talking about the digital divide, and middle America is about to lose another 38,000 jobs in and about Charlotte--can't even buy a computer, and he doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand his legacy of fear. Roosevelt has freedom from fear as his legacy. What we have is a legacy of fear. It not that we are not sophisticated and understand globalization. We understand making a living and paying our bills and working hard to do it. Even though you work hard, they tell you: Globalization. Be gone. You, the most productive textile worker in the world, be gone, because you don't understand globalization, competition, competition, productivity. 
   The most productive industrial worker in the world is in the United States. Right now, the record shows Japan to be No. 8; Netherlands is No. 2; Germany is No. 3. 
   The Japanese pay way more in wages. It isn't low wages. They have a specific policy. That Lexus automobile you buy for $30,000 
   in Washington, DC, is sold for $40,000 in downtown Tokyo. They make up the $10,000 on their own domestic economy and got it through the financing, and the people accept that. They are taking over more and more and more. The distinguished Senator is a foreign policy and an expert, and he knows better than any that money talks. Forget about the Sixth Fleet, forget about the hydrogen bomb. Money talks now. 
   We have been on a binge in the 1990s, but financially we are going out of business. The market is showing it right this afternoon while I am talking. You can talk to anybody in the trucking business. It is closing in, and people are beginning to hunker down. 
   When I started my remarks, I related when the distinguished Senator was in the Kennedy administration, we put in a 7-point textile program because 10 percent of America's consumption of textiles and clothing was going to be represented in imports. Now we have two-thirds. We are ready to get rid of the other third overnight, and we think we are proud of it; we are doing a good job. 
   It is a well considered thing with respect to Africa, the Caribbean, to help them find business. We believe in it. However, we have given at the store. Now is the time to save the home. Now is the time to save middle America. Now is the time to eliminate the fear by instituting a competitive trade policy. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, teen pregnancy is an alarming health, social and economic problem for our country and we must all work together to address it. Every year, more than a million girls under the age of 20 become pregnant at an estimated cost of $6.9 billion to American taxpayers. In South Carolina, teen pregnancy is of particular concern. Our state has the 10th highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, spending more than a billion dollars a year to cover direct and indirect costs for children born to teen mothers. The efforts of organizations such as the Greenville Council for the Prevention of Teen Pregnancy have made a difference--teen pregnancy in Greenville County, SC has decreased 44% since 1988 for girls aged 14-17. Community awareness and education are the key and I would like bring to my colleagues' attention that May has been designated Teen Pregnancy Prevention Awareness Month. It is our duty to ensure that America's youth have a bright, healthy and secure future.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize one of South Carolina's most talented journalists, Robert Ariail, who was recently selected as one of the three finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning. This is the second time he has made the Pulitzer shortlist, having also been a 1995 finalist. Since joining The State newspaper in Columbia, SC in 1984, Mr. Ariail has informed and charmed South Carolina readers with a collection of original, insightful and finely-crafted cartoons. Having been a subject of his satire, I can personally attest to his talent. His work has earned him numerous national and international awards including the Overseas Press Club's Thomas Nast Award, the National Headliner Award and the national Sigma Delta Chi Award. I have faith that three times will be the charm for Robert Ariail and the Pulitzer; this prestigious award could not go to a more deserving person.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember auto racing's Lee Petty, who died last week at the age of 86. A pioneer of the sport, he claimed 55 titles, including the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959, before a 1961 collision ended his competitive career. His son Richard carried the torch with style, collecting seven Winston Cup trophies and establishing a fan base Lee Petty could have only dreamed of back in the late 1940s when he was scorching North Carolina dirt tracks. But it doesn't end there. Lee's grandson, Kyle, a good friend of mine, continues to find success on the NASCAR circuit and Lee's 17-year-old great-grandson, Adam, recently made his NASCAR debut. 
   The name Petty has become synonymous with racing, and for good reason. Lee Petty had the foresight to invest in a sport with little pedigree but a heaping portion of American guts and glory. He understood that a driver's personality was often as powerful as the car he drove, and spectators would pay good money to go along for the ride. His empire, Petty Enterprises, bears witness to the clarity of that vision, having produced 271 race winners and 10 NASCAR champions. 
   Despite great success, Lee Petty never acted like a superstar. He lived with his wife, Elizabeth, in the same modest house where they had raised their children. Perhaps humbleness, and a willingness to brave the hot sun for hours to sign autographs, will prove to be Lee Petty's greatest contribution to American sports. An editorial in Charleston, SC's daily newspaper, the Post and Courier, concludes: ``In a day where money seems to be the overriding concern of so many athletes, Lee Petty was a reminder of what is important in the sporting world--and why folks gravitate toward the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Lee Petty's grown-up NASCAR has never forgotten that a professional sport should be family- and fan-oriented.'' The patriarch of one of professional sports' most celebrated families, Lee Petty has left a legacy that will linger over American racetracks for generations to come.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pipeline Safety and Community Protection Act of 2000 on behalf of the administration. Yesterday, Vice President GORE transmitted this proposal to the Congress, and requested introduction and referral of the bill to the appropriate committee. The purpose of this legislation is to provide for enhanced safety and environmental protection in pipeline transportation. 
   The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a field hearing in Bellingham, Washington, last month on pipeline safety. In addition, I expect the committee to hold another hearing on pipeline safety reauthorization within the next month. Senator MURRAY has introduced a pipeline safety bill and it is my understanding that an additional pipeline safety bill is to be introduced by Chairman MCCAIN today. I am interested in reviewing all of the bills and look forward to the committee's action on pipeline safety reauthorization in the coming months.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, it has been over 30 years since I set off on my hunger tour of South Carolina, where I observed first-hand the shocking condition of health care and nutritional habits in rural parts of my state. The good news is, we have come a long way since then. The bad news is, there is still much work to be done. Like the ``hunger myopia'' I described in my book ``The Case Against Hunger,'' we suffer today from a sort of ``health care myopia,'' a condition in which a booming economy and low unemployment rates mask a reality--that many Americans eke out a living in society's margins, and most of them lack health insurance. Ironically, as the stock market soars, so do the numbers of uninsured in our country, at a rate of more than 100,000 each month; 53 million Americans are expected to be uninsured by 2007. 
   The health care debate swirls around us, reaching fever pitch in Congress, where I have faith that we will soon reach an agreement on expanding coverage and other important issues. However, I see a need to immediately address the health care concerns of these left-behind and sometimes forgotten citizens. They cannot and should not have to wait for Congress to hammer out health care reform in order to receive the medical care so many of us take for granted. That's why I sponsored, along with Senator BOND, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to double the funding for health centers over the next five years. The Bond-Hollings Resolution to Expand Access to Community Health Centers (REACH) recommends that we start the process with a $150 million increase in FY 2001. Let me emphasize that this measure is a cost-saving investment, not an increase in spending. 
   While ideas about health care have changed dramatically, community health centers have remained steadfast in their mission, quietly serving their communities and doing a tremendous job. Last year, community health centers served 11 million Americans in decrepit inner-city neighborhoods as well as remote rural areas, 4.5 million of which were uninsured. It's no wonder these centers have won across-the-board, bipartisan support. They have a proven track record of providing no-nonsense, preventive and primary medical services at rock-bottom costs. They're the value retailers of the health care industry, if you will, treating a patient at a cost of less than $1.00 per day, or about $350 annually. 
   Not only are these centers providing care at low costs, but they are saving precious health care dollars. An increased investment in health centers will mean fewer uninsured patients are forced to make costly emergency room visits to receive basic care and fewer will utilize hospitals' specialty and inpatient care resources. As a consequence, a major financial burden is lifted from traditional hospitals and government and private health plans. Every federal grant dollar invested in health centers saves $7 for Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance: $6 from lower use of specialty and inpatient care and $1 from reduced emergency room visits. 
   The value of community health centers can be measured in two other significant ways. First of all, the centers' focus on wellness and prevention, services largely unavailable to uninsured people, will lead to savings in treatment down the road. And secondly, health centers foster growth and development in their communities, shoring up the very people they serve. They generate over $14 billion in annual economic activity in some of the nation's most economically depressed areas, employing 50,000 people and training thousands of health professionals and volunteers. 
   It should also be noted that community health centers are just that--community-based. They are not cookie cutter programs spun from the federal government wheel, but area-specific, locally-managed centers tailored to the unique needs of a community. They are governed by consumer boards composed of patients who utilize the center's services, as well as local business, civic and community leaders. In fact, it is stipulated that center clients make up at least 51 percent of board membership. This set-up not only ensures accountability to the local community and taxpayers, but keeps a constant check on each center's effectiveness in addressing community needs. 
   In South Carolina, community health centers have a long history of meeting the care requirements of the areas they serve. The Beaufort-Jasper Comprehensive Health Center in Ridgeland, the Franklin C. Fetter Family Health Center in Charleston, and Family Health  Centers, Inc. in Orangeburg were among the first community health centers established in the nation. The Beaufort-Jasper Center was very innovative for its day, in the late 1960s, tackling not only health care needs, but related needs for clean water, indoor toilets and other sanitary services. Today, the number of South Carolina health centers has grown to 15. They currently provide more than 167,000 people, 10 percent of which are uninsured, with a wide range of primary car services. Yet despite the success story, a need to throw a wider net is obvious. Of the 3.8 million South Carolinians, nearly 600,000 have no form of health insurance. That means roughly 15% of the state population is uninsured. Another 600,000 residents are ``underinsured,'' meaning that they do not receive comprehensive health care coverage from their insurance plans and must pay out-of-pocket for a number of specialty services, procedures, tests and medications. 
   South Carolina's statistics are mirrored nationwide. The swelling ranks of the uninsured are outgrowing our present network of community health centers. Adopting this sense of the Senate amendment will ensure the reach of community health centers expands to meet increasing demand. It is our responsibility to continue providing our neediest citizens with a basic health care safety net. What better way to do that than by building on a program with a record of positive, fiscally responsible results? Everyone can benefit and take pride in such a worthwhile investment.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to recognize one of South Carolina's most outstanding athletes, Beth Daniel, who was recently inducted into the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour Hall of Fame--only the 16th woman to claim this prestigious honor. 
   A native of Charleston, SC, Daniel moved to Greenville to attend Furman University and play collegiate golf. While a student at Furman, she captured the U.S. Women's Amateur title twice, in 1975 and 1977. She was a member of the 1976 and 1978 U.S. Curtis Cup teams and the 1978 World Cup team. Since joining the LPGA Tour in 1979, she has collected an impressive 32 career victories and seven LPGA awards, including the 1979 LPGA Rookie of the Year award. 
   Beth had a phenomenal year in 1990, winning seven tournaments, including a major--the Mazda LPGA Championship--and setting a record for consecutive rounds in the 60s with nine. Also in 1990, she was named the Rolex Player of the Year and the United Press International Female Athlete of the Year. In 1995, she entered the South Carolina Golf Hall of Fame and, in 1996, became the third player in LPGA history to cross the $5 million mark in career earnings. She was also a member of the victorious 1996 U.S. Solheim Cup team. 
   Beth Daniel's accomplishments on the LPGA Tour and her many contributions to women's golf make her an excellent addition to the LPGA Hall of Fame. She is a credit to her sport, to Charleston, and to the State of South Carolina.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, upon taking office, President Ronald Reagan appointed a commission to root out government waste, fraud and abuse. Headed by Peter Grace, the Grace Commission reviewed the numerous Federal departments and agencies, and called for the elimination of tremendous waste. The commission also called for an annual report on the implementation of its recommendations. Eighty-five percent of the Grace Commission's recommendations were implemented by 1989, but today not only has Congress abandoned the Grace Commission's initiative but is racing in the other direction. 
   Section 201 of the Social Security Act requires that Social Security surpluses be invested in Treasury bills so that the trust fund can reap interest and grow. Paradoxically, section 201 requires that the trust fund be spent or eliminated. When you buy Treasury bills you give the Government the money and the Government, in turn, gives you a note or bond which amounts to an IOU. The only way to have the trust fund reflect a surplus instead of a deficit is to require the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain in the trust fund cash in an amount equal to the total redemption value of its Treasury bills. Today, instead of trust fund surpluses of $1,099 billion, the Social Security ``lockbox'' is $1,009 billion in IOUs. 
   The policy of investing in U.S. Government instruments is sound. Some think that the fund could make more money by investing in the stock market, but this involves risk that the Congress is determined not to take. Fifteen years ago we only owed Social Security $50 billion. We were not worried because we were taking in surpluses each year. In 1990, we amended the Budget Act prohibiting the President and/or Congress from reporting a budget offset by Social Security surpluses. We wanted the people to know the true condition of the Social Security trust fund and the growth of the national debt. Nevertheless, surpluses continued to be applied against the national debt obscuring its elephantine growth. As the debt grows, carrying charges or interest costs grow. Come the year 2013, there will be a day of reckoning. In 2013, there will not be enough revenue from payroll taxes to pay the Social Security benefits. Congress, for the first time, will look to the trust fund which was supposed to have been saved to take care of the baby boomers. Instead, the Social Security trust fund is projected to be in the red $4 trillion. Congress will have two options: cut the benefits or raise the taxes. Looking at the increasing need and already short $4 trillion, Congress will no doubt cut benefits. In the meantime, interests costs on the national debt, the waste that the Grace Commission intended to eliminate, grows like ``gangbusters.'' 
   When President Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget last in 1968 the annual interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Today, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates it will be $362 billion--almost a billion dollars a day for nothing. No one thinks we should accumulate $4 trillion in the Social Security trust fund by repealing section 201. Yet, the people should be awakened to the fact that Congress hasn't paid for the Government it has been providing for 31 years. CBO estimated in February that we will spend $58.9 billion more this year than we take in. Looking at the votes in Congress since that time, the deficit will exceed $100 billion. Talk of a surplus is a total farce. Talk of not spending Social Security is a total farce. Talk of a Social Security lockbox is a total farce. And any proposal for a tax cut is no more than an increase in the debt, an increase in interest costs, an increase in waste. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and yield the floor. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now the gamesmanship is revealed. 
   Look at this amendment. It says let's spend Social Security. 
   Let me read that to you. 
   Until such time as Congress enacts major Social Security reform legislation, the surplus funds each year of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust funds shall be reused to reduce the debt owed by the public. This section shall not apply beginning the fiscal year. 
   They say reduce the debt owed by the public. You are back to playing the game of taking one credit card and paying off the other credit card and owing the same amount. It is as if I have a MasterCard and a Visa card. I want to pay off the Visa card with the MasterCard. I say the Visa card is the public debt. And I paid it off--$3.6 trillion--never mentioning that my MasterCard bill went up by the same amount. 
   My distinguished colleague from Wyoming is a cosponsor. He smiles because he is a CPA. He knows what we're talking about. 
   As the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. Rivlin, says, you are just taking the debt from one pocket and putting it in another. 
   I want the distinguished Chair and the Parliamentarian to pay close attention because a point of order will be made later. 
   In other words, over on the third page of the particular amendment, it reads: No bill to increase revenues shall be deemed to have passed the House of Representatives or the Senate unless approved by a majority of the total membership of each House of Congress by a rollcall vote. 
   That is in violation of Section 305 of the Budget Act. It has not been considered and referred to the Budget Committee. That point of order can be made in due time. 
   I refer to what the law says about the public debt, and not what Alan Greenspan says. I worked with Alan Greenspan 20 years ago when I was the chairman of the Budget Committee. I have tremendous respect and affection for him. But he represents Wall Street. As long as we can borrow from ourselves; namely, as long as we can spend surpluses on government programs, then we stay out of the stock market. Mr. Greenspan doesn't want us coming in with the sharp elbows of Government driving out private capital and running up interest rates. 
   As long as we play the game for Wall Street, Mr. Greenspan is happy. We have had a wonderful economy. Rather than raise interest rates, we ought to put in a value-added tax allocated to reducing the deficit and the debt. Then we could save trillions of dollars not only in principal but in interest costs. That bill is in the Finance Committee. I introduced it. I had a hearing when Senator Bentsen was the chairman. But I have not been able to get a hearing on it since then. I would be glad to start this afternoon with a hearing on that initiative. 
   I think that is what we have to do. 
   This debt goes up, up, and away, as shown by the numbers published by the Secretary of Treasury.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you will see that when we started the fiscal year the debt was $5.656 trillion It has gone up to $5.750 trillion. 
   We have increased the debt. Everyone is talking about ``surplus.'' What are we going to do with all of these great surpluses? 
   We do not have a surplus. We had a deficit last year of $127 billion. 
   As the debt goes up, I am trying to clear up the confusion in this particular body rather than engaging in this charade. 
   When the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee keeps talking about how he paid down the public debt by $1.1 trillion, here is the actual record as provided in the Budget Committee of the non-Social Security surplus: 
   In the year 2001, $11.1 billion; 2002, $3.2 billion; 2003, $6.5 billion; 2004, $8.7 billion; 2005, $12.7 billion, for a total of $42.2 billion. 
   The distinguished chairman says he pays down the debt $1.1 trillion. It is actually $42 billion in non-Social Security surpluses. And, of course, the rest of it--over $1 trillion--is Social Security. Yet, in the same breath, he maintains that we are saving Social Security with a lockbox. 
   I pointed out a second ago that we have nothing but IOUs in the lockbox. 
   Let me refer to the most recent Congressional Budget Office figures on the Social Security surplus. As of last year, 1999, we had a surplus of $125 billion. In this past fiscal year, we expect a surplus of $154 billion; 2001, $166 billion; 2002, $183 billion; 2003, $196 billion; 2004, $209 billion; and 2005, $225 billion. 
   That is how you may be able to use the expression ``pay down the debt.'' They say pay down the public debt because they don't want to say they are separating, in their minds, the public debt from the government debt. You simply can't do that. There is just one debt. We owe it.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this particular chart shows that in 1999 we  looted $1.869 trillion from all of the trust funds. This year, we are on course to loot $2.106 trillion. We have $78 billion in non-Social Security surpluses. That is tied up in Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, the unemployment compensation fund, the highway-airport trust fund, railroad retirement, etc. 
   We are beginning to make the record and have it understood. 
   If there is any doubt with respect to the public debt, I refer to the particular budget that is now under consideration on page 5, ``Public Debt.'' 
   ``The appropriate levels of public debt......''--I am referring to the budget; it will get a majority vote. We are going through a little exercise. I say ``a little exercise''; it is actually a charade. We worked 2 days and nights, and we produced the budget. Upon completion of a budget resolution in committee, the chairman is allowed to make technical adjustments through a unanimous consent. This year the technical adjustment was $60 billion. Imagine that. Tell the appropriators they have to cut some $60 billion in order to fall within the caps. 
   The instrument itself, I refer to S. Con. Res. 101, page 5:

   Until such time as Congress enacts Social Security reform legislation, these surplus funds of Social Security shall be used to reduce the debt.  
   So you are using Social Security trust funds to pay down the national debt? And yet you are saying we are saving Social Security. 
   So if I increase the debt for Kosovo or for regular defense or for food stamps or for foreign aid or for your pay and my pay, or whatever, that is the debt of the Government. That is the national debt and you use Social Security to pay it?

It's an increase in the debt of $297,712,000. Here is the Senator's commitment to reducing the national debt. 
   There is no commitment that I have seen. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a listing of the national debt as it has gone up since the days of President Truman.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one can see how that debt has gone up. One can see we were doing pretty good under the Budget Act, which was the solution we had in 1993 under President Clinton. We came from a $403.6 billion deficit. We were spending over $400 billion more than we took in, until 1993 when we reduced it to $349.3 billion. And in 1994, it went down to $292.3 billion. Then in 1995, it went down to $277 billion. In 1996, it went down to $260.9 billion. In 1997, it was $187.8 billion. In 1998, it was $109 billion. In 1999, it was $127 billion. It went back up last year. 
   Under this chart, it shows we are going back down. These are CBO figures. 
   As I related a minute ago, with the votes we have had, it is going to be over $100 billion. I am always trying to jump off the Capitol dome to emphasize a point. I make that offer again to my distinguished chairman--I will jump off the Capitol dome if we balance the budget. Watch. Come October, when we adjourn for the year and start the new fiscal year, we will be running a deficit again. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of our time.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation in an attempt to settle a long-standing dispute between the National Park Service (NPS) and Fort Sumter Tours, Inc. (FST) regarding the calculation of FST's Concessioner Franchise Fees. 
   Fort Sumter National Monument was established by Congress in 1948 and is located in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Congress directed that the National Park Service (NPS) ``Shall maintain and preserve it [the fort] for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States.'' (16 USC 450ee et. seq.) 
   Since 1962, the private concessioner, Fort Sumter Tours, Inc. (FST), has provided visitors with service to this national monument. In 1985, FST was asked by NPS to acquire a new landside docking facility and invest in a new boat that would cost FST over $1 million. In exchange for these investments, an agreement was reached between FST and the NPS to provide a fifteen-year contract, with a franchise fee set by the NPS at 4.25 percent of gross receipts. 
   By statutory law all park concessionaires are required to pay a franchise fee based upon a percentage of  their gross receipts. In 1992 the NPS unilaterally attempted to increase FST's franchise fee from 4.25 percent to 12 percent and a dispute has existed ever since. This increase was based upon a Franchise Fee Analysis (FFA) prepared by the NPS, which FST claims to be inconsistent with Park Service guidelines existing at that time. I believe if errors have been made they need to be corrected. 
   While the Courts have ruled that the NPS has the authority to raise the franchise fee, that is not the actual dispute. The actual dispute is whether the NPS calculated the increase in these fees appropriately. This legislation provides for arbitration between FST and the NPS to settle a dispute that has lasted for almost eight years. By the NPS's own account, FST has been a valuable service benefiting thousands and thousands of visitors to Fort Sumter National Monument. It is time for the NPS and FST to settle their differences and move forward.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oceans Act of 2000, a bill calling for a plan of action for the twenty-first century to explore, protect, and use our oceans and coasts through the coming millennium. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by my colleagues, Senators STEVENS, SNOWE, KERRY, BREAUX, INOUYE, CLELAND, WYDEN, AKAKA, BOXER, MURRAY, LAUTENBERG, FEINSTEIN, LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, REED, SARBANES, and SCHUMER. 
   This is not the first time I have come before you to advocate legislation to ensure our national ocean policy is coordinated, effective, and sustainable for future generations. In 1997, I introduced an Oceans Act to create both an independent ocean commission and a federal interagency ocean council. While the Senate passed this bill unanimously, it was not enacted before the end of the 105th Congress. We continued the work we started in 1997 by introducing the Senate-passed bill as S. 959, cosponsored by 23 Senators from both sides of the aisle, in May of last year. I now introduce the Oceans Act of 2000, a new bill that reflects the lessons learned among state and federal policymakers, ocean-related industries, and public interest groups who worked together during and after the 1998 Year of the Ocean. 
   What we heard loud and clear from these groups was the need for a balanced, high-level national commission to determine whether the United States is managing its oceans and coasts wisely, and how we can improve or refocus our efforts. Thus, the Oceans Act of 2000 focuses exclusively on the appointment of an independent national Ocean Commission to recommend ways to ensure our nation's ocean policy is coordinated, effective, and sustainable for future generations. I believe this is both improved and streamlined legislation that will enjoy wide support from industry, conservation groups, and States. Already we have received letters of support from a cross-section of these interests, all of whom believe we cannot wait any longer to enact this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, it is critical that we enact the Oceans Act of 2000 this year. In 1966 Congress enacted legislation to establish a Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton Commission for its chairman, Julius Stratton) that was to recommend a comprehensive national program to explore the oceans, develop marine and coastal resources, and conserve the sea. The Stratton Commission's report and recommendations have shaped U.S. ocean policy for three decades. We have long needed to take a hard look at this legacy, and a national Ocean Commission could comprehensively evaluate concerns that cannot be viewed effectively through current federal processes or through privately-commissioned studies. For example, an Ocean Commission could evaluate charges that the most critical coastal management issues, such as fishery conservation and data needs, are not given appropriate priority and funding. It could consider whether ocean management regimes that have developed over the last 30 years under a variety of agencies are duplicative and uncoordinated, resulting in costly or time-consuming requirements that may provide little incremental environmental benefit. Finally, it could address the argument that 
   we lack a plan to evalute and plan for future resource needs or to derive benefits from discoveries made possible by advances in ocean technology. 
   It would be difficult to coherently address all these concerns without the high-level comprehensive review provided by this legislation. The Oceans Act of 2000 would establish a 16-member Commission, similar to the Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and report within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. The Commission members would be selected from individuals nominated by majority and minority representatives in both houses of Congress. Eligible individuals include those representing state and local governments, ocean-related industries and public interest groups. I have included new provisions stating that the membership should be balanced geographically to the extent consistent with maintaining the highest level of expertise. 
   The Oceans Act of 2000 specifies that the Commission should examine concerns that range from priority and planning issues to regulatory reform. The Commission is specifically charged with evaluating the cumulative regulatory effect of the myriad of ocean and coastal management regimes, and crafting recommendations for resolving inconsistencies. To ensure we can meet future technical and funding challenges and set our national priorities appropriately, the Commission is directed to review the known and anticipated supply of, and demand for, ocean and coastal resources, as well as review opportunities for development or investment in new products, technologies, or markets related to ocean and coastal activities. Because I believe the Commission should focus on large-scale ocean and coastal policy questions, the bill includes a provision clarifying that the Commission recommendations shall not be specific to the lands and waters within a single state. 
   Finally, once the Commission issues its recommendations, the President must report to Congress on how he will respond to or implement Commission recommendations. We want to be sure that this body is fully informed of, and participates in, how the Nation proceeds once the Commission has completed its work. Finally, the effective date of the Act is at December 31, 2000 in order to enable the current Administration to complete its interagency ocean initiative before the end of the current term, and allow the incoming Administration time to evaluate the Commission nominees and make appointments. 
   This version does not include a federal interagency Ocean Council--I believe that this function is now being filled by the sub-cabinet level Ocean Policy Task Force process announced by the Administration last year. Establishing a second interagency council now would be duplicative, and it is my firm belief that the independent Commission will adequately assess whether the existing interagency process is appropriate or sufficient to address its recommendations. However, it is my hope that interagency coordination on oceans policy will remain an important priority for the next Administration. And I look forward to the day that ocean policy issues are given the highest priority within the federal government by a Cabinet-level entity, without the infighting or discord that has impeded our progress on these issues. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is both appropriate and long overdue. By the end of this decade about 60% of Americans will live along our coasts, which account for less than 10% of our land area. I am amazed that in this era, when we've invested billions of dollars in exploring other planets, we know so little about the ocean and coastal systems upon which we and other living  things depend. Large storms events like Hurricanes Floyd and Hugo, driven by ocean-circulation patterns, pose the ultimate risk to human health and safety. El Nino-related climate events have led to increased incidence of malaria in areas of Colombia and Venezuela. Harmful algal blooms have been linked to deaths of sea lions in California and manatees in Florida, and we are still searching to understand their effects on humans. Mr. President, the oceans are integral to our lives but we are not putting a priority on finding ways to learn more about them, and what they may hold for our future. The oceans are home to 80% of all life forms on Earth, but only 1% of our biotechnology R&D budget will focus on marine life forms. Of the 4 manned submersibles in the world capable of descending to half of the ocean's maximum depth, not a single one of them is operated by the United States! 
   The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the United States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly its security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for food and raw materials, its positions and influence in the World community, and the quality of the environment in which its people live.'' those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago. 
   Mr. President, it is time to look towards the next 30 years. This bill offers us the vision and understanding needed to establish sound ocean and coastal policies for the 21st century, and I think the cosponsors of the legislation for joining with me in recognizing its significance. We look forward to working together in the bipartisan spirit of the Stratton Commission to enact legislation this year that ensures the development of an integrated national ocean and coastal policy well into the next millennium.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I'm addressing the so-called freedom of speech with respect to campaign financing. I explained yesterday afternoon how we, in the 1974 act, tried to clean up the corruption. Cash was being given, all kinds of favors and demands were being made on members of the Government, as well as in the private sector. Numerous people were convicted. We enacted the 1974 act after the Maurice Stans matter in the Nixon campaign. 
   We debated one particular point--that you could not buy the office. Now the contention is that you can buy the office because under the first amendment protecting freedom of speech, and money being speech, there is no way under the Constitution that it can be controlled. Of course, that is a distortion by the Buckley v. Valeo decision for the simple reason that we finally have Justice Stevens saying that ``money is property.'' Justice Kennedy goes right into the distortion. I quote from the case of Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC:  
   The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented----  
   I emphasize the word ``invented''----  
   in Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the political system. It is covert speech. The Court has forced a substantial amount of political speech underground, as contributors and candidates devise ever more elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no account of rising campaign costs.The preferred method has been to conceal the real purpose of the speech. 
   Then further:  
   Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted ..... while straightforward speech in the form of financial contributions paid to a candidate ..... is not. Thus has the Court's decision given us covert speech. This mocks the First Amendment.  
   I hope everybody, particularly the other side of the aisle, understands that I am reading from Justice Kennedy:  
   This mocks the First Amendment.  
   He goes on to say:  
   Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft money. In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling from change.  
   We have it foursquare. There is no question that the majority in Buckley has mocked the first amendment. Four Justices in Buckley v. Valeo found that you could control spending. They treated money as it has been treated in the Congress--as property and not speech. 
   Let's look, for example, at the hearing we had. When the Senate is asked to consider contributions, they consider them property. So we had the Thompson investigation. Seventy witnesses testified in public over a total of 33 days; 200 witness interviews were conducted; 196 depositions were conducted under oath; 418 subpoenas were issued for hearings, depositions, and documents; and more than 1.5 million pages of documents were received. 
   They did not say that Charlie Trie, Johnny Huang and others had free speech. The lawyers in those particular cases would be delighted to hear a Congressman who now takes the position that: Oh, it is all free speech. Don't worry about any violations because the first amendment protects this money. The first amendment protects it as free speech. That is out of the whole cloth. They have been singsonging because they enjoy this particular corruption. 
   What corruption? As I pointed out yesterday, we used to come in here and work. Thirty years ago, under Senator Mansfield, we would come in at 9 o'clock Monday morning and we would have a vote. The distinguished leader at that time usually had a vote to make sure we got here and started our week's work--and I emphasize ``week's work.'' We worked throughout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and we were lucky to complete our work by Friday evening at 5 o'clock. 
   Now: Monday is gone. Tuesday morning is gone. We don't really work here. We are waiting and not having any votes. People are coming back into town. Nobody is here to listen. On Wednesday and Thursday we have to have windows so we can go fundraise. Can you imagine that? That ought to embarrass somebody. But I have asked for windows, too, because that is the way it is. 
   The money chase--the amount of money that must be chased--has corrupted this Congress. Everybody knows it. The people's business is set aside. On Friday, we go back home. What do we do? We have fund-raisers. We don't have free-speech raisers, like they are talking about on the floor of the Senate now. 
   They get all pontifical and stand up and talk oh so eruditely about the Constitution and the first amendment. They know better than anyone that this is property. But as long as they can sell everybody that there are no limits, there are no restrictions on money because it is free speech, then it is ``Katie bar the door'' and we have really gone down the tube. 
   It is not that bad; it is worse. We used to have a break, I think it was on February 12, for Lincoln's birthday. It might have been a long weekend, but it was not a 10-day break. Now, January is gone. Then we had a 10-day break in February. We had a 10-day break again in March. We will have another 10-day break in April. We will have another 10-day break in May and at the beginning of 
   June. Then we will have the Fourth of July break. Then we will have the month of August off--all of this keeping us from doing the people's business. 
   I thought once our campaigns were over we would come up here and go to work on behalf of the people's business. Instead, we work on behalf of our own business: reelection. All in the name of this tremendous volume of money, money, money everywhere. They are trying to defend it on the premise of: Give me the ACLU and the Washington Post. Then they put up a sandwich  board about newspapers: If the Hollings amendment is passed, the newspapers can't write editorials. I never heard of such nonsense. 
   This does not have to do with anybody's freedom of speech. We cannot, should not and would not ever take away anybody's speech. But we can take away the money used in campaigns and limit it just like every other country does. In England, they limit the amount of time in which you can actually conduct the campaign. They do not talk about campaigns in reference to the Magna Carta: Wait a minute, you have taken away my speech here in the Parliament. There is none of that kind of nonsense. But here, it is the kind of thing we are having to put up with. 
   The question is, Can this problem be solved another way? 
   That is exactly what the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD, says: We have a problem. Let's solve it in another way. He puts in a statutory amendment with respect to the flag. 
   With respect to campaign financing, give me a break. We have tried for 25 years--everything from public finance to free TV time, to soft money, to hard money limitations, to any and every idea. 
   Now we have the Vice President proposing an endowment to finance federal campaigns. They think all you have to do is come up with a new idea and then you are really serious about this. If you are going to get serious, vote for this amendment. Then, by gosh, we are playing for keeps. 
   There are a lot of people on McCain-Feingold getting a free ride voting for it, knowing it is never going anywhere because the Senator from Kentucky is manifestly correct, it is patently unconstitutional. There is no question that this Court would find McCain-Feingold unconstitutional. Everybody knows that. This is one grand charade, as the corruption continues. 
   I emphasize that this amendment does not take a side with McCain-Feingold, with hard money, with soft money, with the Vice President's endowment, with anything else or any idea one may have about controlling spending in Federal elections. It is not pro, it is not con, it is not for, it is not against. It merely gives authority to the Congress to do what we intended back in 1974 with the amended version of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971; and that is, to stop people from buying the office. 
   The corruption is such that you have to buy the office. We are required to buy it. I can tell you, because two years ago I spent more of my time raising $5.5 million for my seventh reelection to the Senate than I did campaigning. 
   So I speak advisedly. I have asked for windows. I have asked for parts of this corruption that we are all involved in. The only way it is going to be cleaned up is a constitutional amendment. 
   What does Justice Kennedy say? He says: Buckley mocks the first amendment. Mind you, there was only one Justice who called money property, but another said it mocked the first amendment. Then I read from the decision:  
   Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft money. In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling from change.  
   Imagine that. The Court has immunized the ruling from change; namely, you cannot change it by statute. Listen Senator CONRAD, and any other Senator interested in playing games with this corruption, saying we will put in a little statute. There have been 2,000 or 20,000 amendments to the Constitution. Give me a break. The last five or seven amendments had to do with elections. None of them is as important as this particular national corruption of Congress. We all know about it. We all participate in it. We have no time to be a Congress. We are just a dignified bunch of money raisers for each other and for ourselves. 
   It is sad to have to say that on the floor of the Senate, but it is time we give the people a chance. This does not legislate or provide anything. It just says, come November, as a joint resolution, let the people decide. I think the people have decided. That is why my amendment is timely. During this year's presidential primaries everyone was talking about campaign finance reform--reform, reform, reform. Candidates were saying, I am the reform candidate. 
   The one thing they are trying to reform is campaign financing, this corruption. Now even the Vice President has come out and said: The first day I am your President, I will submit McCain-Feingold--knowing it is an act in futility. Let's pass McCain-Feingold unanimously. The Court throws it out later this year. It is not going anywhere. The Court has time and again said soft money is speech. That is the majority of this crowd. But I admonish the four Justices in Buckley v. Valeo who said they could do it. Now we have two other Justices talking sense. We know good and well that the people want a chance to talk on this, to vote on this. 
   I had no sooner put this up years ago, back in the 1980s, and the States' Governors came and, by resolution, asked that we amend the Hollings amendment so as to include the States. So that now the Hollings amendment reads that Congress is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections, and the States are hereby allowed to regulate or control spending in State elections. 
   It should be remembered that the last, I think, six out of seven amendments, took an average of 17 or 18 months. This is very timely for the people to vote on in November, when the issue has already been discussed and debated throughout the primaries. The people are ready to vote on campaign finance reform. And both presidential candidates, Bush and GORE, are now trying to position themselves as reformers on campaign finance. We can solve that by having the people vote on the issue in and of itself. Within 17 months, on average, we can have the people vote and by this time next year have it confirmed by the Congress and this mess will cleaned up. Then we can go back to work for the people of America and cut out this money machine operation that we call a Congress. 
   We not only have to go out during breaks and raise money, we now have ``power hours.'' We have the ``united fund,'' your fair share allocation that you are supposed to raise and contribute to the committee. It becomes more and more and more. Every time I turn around, instead of trying to get some work done, we have more money demands. 
   So if you want to stop the corruption and stop the charade of 
   calling campaign contributions free speech, this amendment is the solution. We are not taking away anybody's speech. We in Congress don't call it speech when we conduct these hearings, year-long hearings with hundreds of witnesses and millions of pages of testimony to get the scoundrels. For what? Not for exercising their free speech but for violating limitations on money contributions. We treat money as property when we have these fund raisers. We don't call them free-speech raisers. We treat it as property, except when we try to really stop the corruption. 
   I hope we will stop it today and vote affirmatively on the Hollings-Specter amendment so that we can move on and get back to our work. 
   Go up to the majority leader and ask him: Mr. Leader, I would like you to bring up TV violence. He will say: Well, that will take 3 or 4 days. We don't have time. 
   Why don't we have time? We don't work on Monday. We don't work on Friday, just the afternoons on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. We can't even allow amendments. 
   We are going in this afternoon at 3:30 to the Budget Committee, but we have been putting that off again and again. I just checked an hour ago and it was said: We really don't know whether the vote is fixed. They try to fix the jury, fix the vote so there are no amendments to be accepted. The vote is fixed. It is an exercise--if you don't go along with their fix--in futility. Yet Members go around and say: I am a Member of the most deliberative body in the United States, most deliberative body in the world. The money chase has corrupted us so that we are fixed in a position where we can't deliberate. We don't deliberate. We have forgotten about that entirely and, in fact, rather enjoy it. So long as nobody raises any questions and we all can go back home and continue to raise money, we think we are doing a good job. 
   It is a sad situation. I hope we can address it in an up-front manner and support the amendment.  
   I retain the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin. I only hasten to add that this particular amendment has nothing to do with favoring or opposing the McCain-Feingold amendment. I have voted for that at least four or five times already. 
   Read the Nixon v. Shrink decision when they say money is speech, and in the Colorado v. FEC decision when they allowed soft money. One can tell a majority of the Court has no idea. Money talks; money is speech--that is the way the Court is going. I reiterate, McCain-Feingold is an act in futility.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that article was 10 years after Buckley v. Valeo. I am constantly reminded by the opposition that I only got 38 votes in 1997 for my amendment. There is a pleasure, an enjoyment to this wonderful corruption. There is not any question we used to have a better conscience. This article shows how even the Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and others cosponsored it. I had a dozen Republican cosponsors. 
   Now the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. MCCONNELL, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, have it down to a Republican article of faith: We have the money and they, the Democrats, have the unions, and so we are not going to limit the money. 
   Governor George W. Bush has already raised $74 million and spent all but $8 million of it. He spent $64 million by March. The very idea of buying the office is a disgrace. It is a disgrace. As Senator Long of Louisiana said when we passed the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, we want to make sure everyone can participate. 
   Buckley v. Valeo has stood the first amendment on its head. It has taken it away. That is what the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Kentucky, and others do not understand. 
   The Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, amended the first amendment to take away the speech of the ordinary American in important Federal elections. There is no question when one has to raise 5.5 million bucks in a little State like South Carolina--I looked around for somebody else to run last time. We could not get them to run for Congress because it cost too much. We could not even get a candidate on our side in the First District, in the Third District, and all around. It has gotten to where people say: Look, this thing costs too much; I don't have the time, I don't have the money. 
   That is a part of the corruption. 
   Look at the considerations of Justice White 25 years ago, and I read from his opinion. I remind everybody that four of the Justices found money as property and not speech; it could be controlled. It was only by a 1-vote margin that we are into this 25-year dilemma, like a dog chasing its tail around and around and the corruption growing and growing. 
   I quote from Justice White:  
   It is accepted that Congress has power under the Constitution to regulate the election of Federal officers, including the President and Vice President. This includes the authority to protect the elective processes against the two great natural and historical enemies of all republics--open violence and insidious corruption.  
   Then talking about the insidious corruption:  
   Pursuant to this undoubted power of Congress to vindicate the strong public interest in controlling corruption and other undesirable uses of money in connection with election campaigns, the Federal Election Campaign Act substantially broadened the reporting and disclosure requirements that so long have been a part of the Federal law. Congress also concluded that limitations on contributions and expenditures were essential if the aims of the act were to be achieved fully.  
   Buckley v. Valeo limited contributions. It took away freedom of speech under the premise here--what a terrible thing. I have the quotes from the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that ``we eviscerate the first amendment with this Hollings-Specter amendment that limits who may speak, when they may speak, what they may speak''--by the way, this applies to the press--``what they may report, when they may report and who may report.'' 
   Actually, there is no question that the decision in Buckley amended the first amendment. What we are trying to do is complete a uniformity where everybody is treated equally, the speech of the contributor as well as the speech of the candidate. 
   Going on, I quote from Justice White:  
   The congressional judgment which was ours to accept was that other steps must be taken to counter the corrosive effects of money in Federal election campaigns.  
   This is 25 years ago:  
   One of these steps is 608(e), which aside from those funds that are given to the candidate or spent at his request or with his approval or cooperation, limits what a contributor may independently spend in support or denigration of one running for Federal office.  
   That is the soft money about which we are talking. Moving on, I quote:  
   Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures also have the potential for corruption. But the Court claimed more insight as to what may improperly influence candidates than is possessed by the majority of Congress that passed this bill, and the President who signed it. Those supporting the bill undeniably include many seasoned professionals who have been deeply involved in elective processes and have viewed them at close range over many years.  
   Then he goes on:  
   I have little doubt, in addition, that limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising function.  
   Actually talking about freedom of speech, you have time to talk to constituents. I remember after the last campaign, I went around the State, county to county, and they said: Fritz, why in the world are you coming around? You just won. I said: Yeah, but I really didn't get to talk to the voters. I had to talk to contributors. I didn't have time for the voters other than during the scheduled debates. I would like to meet the voters and talk to them in a more intimate way. That is quoted in the press. 
   This is 25 years ago, foreseeing the corruption. 
   I quote from Justice White:  
   There is nothing objectionable, indeed, it seems to me a weighty interest in favor of the provision in the attempt to insulate the political expression of Federal candidates from the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the Court has returned them all to the treadmill. 
   It is also important to restore and maintain public confidence in Federal elections. It is critical to obviate or dispel the impression that Federal elections are purely and simply a function of money, that Federal officers are bought and sold, or that political races are reserved for those who have the facility and the stomach for doing whatever it takes to bring together those interest groups and individuals who can raise or contribute large fortunes in order to prevail at the polls.  
   I could go on and on. There is no question that we had a very erudite observation here by Justice White, very visionary. Everybody says: You have to have somebody who has vision. That is a visionary statement in Buckley v.  Valeo. Even though it was in a dissenting opinion, it foretold what we were going to run into. 
   Once the campaign was over, I thought we would come up here and work for the people of the United States, not for ourselves. We could give all the time to our treadmill here, as Justice White says, but we raise the money, raise the money, raise the money, raise the money. It goes on and on and it takes away from our actual function as the most deliberative body. 
   Yes, we got only 38 votes the last time. The conscience is diminishing. We got a majority vote back in the 1980s back when we had a conscience.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. This is the conscience of this crowd here. When you can't get votes--it is amazing I get any kind of votes because the overwhelming majority calls this deficit a surplus. You can find out that on 9-30-99, the debt was $5.656 trillion. It has now grown to $5.730 trillion. 
   I just got back from London. I had lunch there with Parliament, and I asked the Presiding Officer: Do you all have a deficit or a surplus? He said: Oh, we have a surplus. We have a balanced budget. I said: How do you measure it? He said: By the amount of money you have to borrow. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer is an eminent certified public accountant. He knows how to keep the books. He would not go along with the kinds of books we keep here, showing that we're borrowing money and calling it a surplus. It's a deficit. It is an increase in the debt. 
   In addition, the interest expense on the public debt outstanding is $158,799,000,000. That is what we have spent just on interest costs since the beginning of the fiscal year. That is the real waste. We had a conscience under President Reagan; now it's waste, fraud, and abuse. I served on the Grace Commission. Surely, we could get votes in those days because we had a conscience. 
   We don't have a conscience anymore. Thirty-eight votes; I am lucky to get 18. I don't mind. Somehow, somewhere, some time, this has to be exposed. It is one grand corruption of the Congress itself. We know it. Everybody else knows it. The public showed that they know it, too, during the primaries. 
   If we do not get a hold of ourselves and do something about it in this particular session, we are gone goslings. That is all I have to say. 
   It is a tragic thing when you have to stand up here and defend the right of the people to vote on controlling spending in elections. They have it at city hall with the constable. They have it in the State capitals with the Governor. Now we have it with the national Congress. Everybody wants to try to control spending. 
   We go along with this farce of free speech and that we are amending the Constitution, really, the first amendment. In reality we are amending the Constitution to give the first amendment its freedom of speech. The first amendment gave that freedom of speech, but once money is attached to the speech, you take it away from those who do not have money. That is exactly what has occurred. 
   Buckley v. Valeo has amended the first amendment. They are all so excited and alarmed about it and laugh as they go back into the Cloakroom because they know exactly what we are talking about on the floor. Nobody is here. It is a Tuesday morning and nobody has to vote until 2:15. We will have a caucus and we will go in and talk about how we have been doing on fundraising. Then when we get through talking about doing the fundraising, we will go ahead and vote this down, according to the Senator from Kentucky. But there will come another day. I am glad for the 6-year term. We have a little time left. I have been at it some 20 years now. We will continue. It takes a little time. But what Justice White stated back in Buckley v. Valeo has come to pass. It has brought us to where the most deliberative body can't deliberate. 
   I retain the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum. Does the other side have any time? Both sides?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my colleagues all acknowledge the need for more and more money each time we come up for election or get into political campaigns. 
   There has been very little discussion of the actual chase for that money which has corrupted the institution. I hate to say that. When I got here 33 years ago, we would come to work, and Senator Mansfield, the majority leader, would have a vote at 9 o'clock on Monday morning. Senator BYRD did the  same thing as majority leader. We would work throughout the week up until 5 o'clock on Friday. Now Mondays and Fridays are gone. We start on the half day on Tuesdays, and then Wednesdays and Thursdays we all want a window. 
   There is no window in the Chamber, but there are plenty of windows. You to have get with the dialog, as they call it up here, and that is for the money chase. We used to have the extended Easter break and the Fourth of July, but now we have not only January gone, there are 10 days in February, March, April, 10 days in May, June, the July break, August, the month off, and we are supposed to go home and get money. 
   If you go to the leader and ask, please call up a bill, it may take 3 or 4 days, he looks at you as if you are loony. Talk about debating, deliberating--this deliberative body has been so corrupted, it can't deliberate. Don't give me this so-called eviscerate the first amendment. Buckley v. Valeo did that. The intent there was that every mother's son, anybody of ordinary means, could offer for the Presidency. What has really happened is that we have taken away the speech of those who are without money. And for those who are millionaires, they can buy the office. In fact, it has stood the intent on its head whereby, instead of forbidding the purchase of the office, we have to buy it. You have to get more money. 
   I hope we will vote for this constitutional amendment which is neutral. It is not pro or con McCain-Feingold or public financing or whatever it is. It gives the people a chance to vote. All you have to do is look to the primaries we have just gotten through. The people are ready, willing, and able to vote and stop this corruption. 
   I thank the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this amendment is offered on behalf of myself, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, and the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID. 
   Let me go right to the heart of some comments just made because I want to emphasize what the distinguished Senator from North Dakota said. 
   One, with respect to the matter of actually passing a statute whereby the statute would suffice, I only refer specifically, because I have been reading it at length, to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Nixon v. Shrink, that for nearly a half century the Court has extended first amendment protection to a multitude of forms of speech, such as making false inflammatory statements, filing lawsuits, dancing nude, exhibiting drive-in movies with nudity, burning flags, and wearing military uniforms. It goes on to cite even more examples. 
   That is why this Senator would not vote for the statute. I think that is dancing around the fire and a putoff. On the contrary, I intend to support the constitutional amendment. But I do agree with the observation of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota that the Constitution should not be amended lightly, and, as the Senator stated, not amended when there are other ways. 
   There is a definite difference between the matter of burning the flag--there is really no threat to the Republic. There is no threat to our democracy. There is no corruption. I do not like it; others do not like it. I hope we can pass the amendment. 
   But there is basis for the concern that a constitutional amendment is not in order because there is no threat to the Republic. We have seen and, unfortunately, been hardened in a sense to observing the flag being burned. I happen to be like the man: Convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. They can keep on saying that is constitutional. I do not believe it. 
   I think an amendment to the Constitution is necessary. But only look around us. Where is everybody? Out raising money. The Senator from South Carolina is not charging that an individual is bribed. I know of no bribes. That is not my argument. 
   My argument and position is that this Congress, the process, and the Government have been corrupted by the money chase. We all know the amount of money. But all you have to do is have been around here for 30-some years and you get the feel, very definitely, that the money chase has taken over and we are thoroughly corrupted. 
   I say that because here it is Monday. It is really a wash day. There are no votes. There is nobody here to hear you. This is no deliberative body. That is really a nasty joke on all of us because we do not deliberate anymore. 
   I remember over 30 years ago when we would come in on Monday morning and work all day, have votes at 9 o'clock on Monday morning, go throughout Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and hope to get through by 5 on Friday and take Saturday and Sunday off and go back to work on Monday. But we start the week here with no votes, nobody around, no deliberation, no exchange of ideas, no legislation, just a sort of fill-in so you can give those who are concerned their time at bat, limited as it is, because it is only half time. Nobody is here to listen, so you can learn the fallacy in your arguments or the substance thereof. But there is no really good exchange out here by the Members themselves. Monday is gone, and Tuesday morning follows suit because we have to wait for everybody to get back from their Monday evening fundraisers. Then we have Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is gone. 
   If you don't think it is corrupted, go up and ask the majority leader, if you please, to take up a bill. ``Oh'', he says, ``wait a minute, that might take 3 or 4 days.'' It's a given, that you are not going to call a bill that is going to take 3 or 4 days of consideration and debate by colleagues. It is not going to be called. Nothing is called unless the jury is fixed. 
   Why haven't we taken up the budget? Because they haven't been able to fix the vote of the Senator from Texas. They fixed all the others. They got them in line. I don't know what their budget is. There has been give and take  among the members on the Budget Committee on the Republican side, but we on the Democratic side have yet to see a budget, even though it is the end of March. We are supposed to have had the markup for several weeks and be ready to report it out by this weekend. We do have notice, but you can bet your boots if we come together tomorrow afternoon and Thursday, they will use Thursday night and the threat of, ``wait a minute, you will have to work on Friday, so hurry up, let's vote until 1 o'clock in the morning,'' whatever it is, because none of your amendments is going to pass; we have the votes. 
   That is the most deliberative process. That is the corruption the money chase has gotten us into. You can't consider anything here. Come Tuesday, they say, ``well, we will have a caucus.'' In the main, that is about money and how we are going to collect it, and how we will dock each other so many thousands of dollars, and who has been to meetings, and everything else of that kind. Otherwise, come evening, ``hurry up and let's adjourn early because I have a fundraiser Tuesday evening.'' Or, on Wednesday we have a window. ``Can we make sure; I have to go all the way downtown at lunchtime, so let's not have any real conduct of the Senate or work of the Congress because I want a window so we can go down and have that fundraiser; or wait until the evening.'' The same thing occurs on Thursday. 
   By the way, there is a special Wednesday afternoon set up where we are supposed to go over to our campaign committees and get on the phone for hours in the afternoon. To do what? To call for money. I thought when we got elected, the campaign was over and we were going to work for the people. Instead, we go to work for ourselves. The entire process has been corrupted. That is why we need a constitutional amendment. 
   No, not likely. We have tried for 25 years to get around Buckley v. Valeo. We got a little squeak from Justice Stevens in the Nixon v. Shrink decision. He said: Money is property, not speech. But he was only one. The rest of the Court, in other words, had every opportunity to consider it being property and not speech, but they reiterated Nixon v. Shrink, that money is speech. My gracious, if you read that dissenting opinion with Scalia and the other two Justices, they read it to go with removing the limits on contributions. Just buy it. This thing is a real disaster; it is an embarrassment. 
   Just coming on the floor, they called my staff and said: Why in the world would you want to amend the Constitution here but not 
   with the flag? Well, of course, I corrected that. I would amend the Constitution with the flag. But those who have some concern about the flag amendment to the Constitution need not hesitate with respect to this particular amendment. Otherwise, they have been living in a cocoon somewhere, or they have been in China during the last campaign, because all you have to do is look at the primaries and see that the one thing, whether it was Independent, Democratic, Republican or any other kind of votes, that they were trying to clean up this system. 
   Senator GORE, Vice President GORE, got the message. He said: The first thing I will do as President of the United States is introduce McCain-Feingold and do away with soft money. 
   Governor George W. Bush said that was a terrible thing. I read that in the news. But I remembered back to January 23, in his interview with George Will, when Governor Bush said soft money, both corporate and labor, should be banned. I agree. But I will have to agree with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that it is patently unconstitutional according to the Court. All we are trying to do is constitutionalize McCain-Feingold or any and every other idea you want, whether you want to publicly finance, whether you want to give free TV time, whether you want to limit, whether you want to not limit, whether you want to increase the limit--whatever you want to do. Don't give me the argument on this one because this only constitutionalizes your particular idea. 
   Let me read exactly what it says:  
   Congress shall have the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, or for the election to, Federal office.  
   We have had this up for over 10 years, Senator SPECTER and myself. I have had it up for over 20 years. I can tell you, the States in unanimity, the Governors' conference and all, came and said: Please put us in. We have the same problem, not just for Federal office but for State office. It is costing $1 million to get elected to the city council. It has corrupted the entire process over the land, and everybody knows it.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. This is entitled ``Pander Gap.'' We are not pandering to the people. We have taken away the votes of all the people, not just the 18-year-olds. The survey is used to figure out this so-called polling. They say we followed the polls. I am quoting this part of it:  
   ..... the surveys are used to figure out how to sell policies that have already been constructed (much as market researchers convene focus groups and sponsor surveys to find new ways to get you to buy soap). 
   Rather than hewing to the demands of voters ..... today's lawmakers answer to ``the extreme ideological elements of their parties, to their contributors, and to special interests.''  
   In short, to money, money, money, millions and millions. The year before last I was supposed to run a race in South Carolina on about $3 million at the most. I had to spend $5.5 million. Since the South has gone Republican, it made it more difficult. With two Republican Senators from Alabama, two from Mississippi, two from Texas, two from Tennessee, it seems everywhere I look, I've got Republicans buzzing around me. 
   I am not critical because I got a lot of good Republican votes. I am grateful for the Republicans who did vote for me. But, in essence, it was tough to get those contributions because they didn't want their names to appear, and then go to the club and have to explain why in the world they contributed to that scoundrel HOLLINGS? They were ready to give me the money, but they could not. So I had to travel the land and tell my story. I was lucky. They gave me a rather hard-working fellow as an opponent who was all over the place. Didn't know what he was talking about, about the polls and everything, and trying to take a fellow who had been in office almost 50 years, and being arrogant about it. You can't be arrogant and get elected seven times to the Senate. I can tell you that. You respond to the people, and I happily do so. I am responding to the people of this country. 
   I am not amending the Constitution lightly. I will yield in a moment to give my colleague from Alabama time. Let's hearken back to 1971 and 1974, the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act. I will never forget in the 1968 race, Maurice Stans was running around almost like the Chamber of Commerce. He told various businesses: Your fair share is this. He came to the textile industry in South Carolina and said it is $350,000. This was 30-some years ago. They had never raised $350,000 for this fellow, and I had done everything in the world for the textile industry. They got together 10 of them with $35,000 apiece. 
   What happened was individuals gave a million, or $500,000, $2 million, different amounts in cash. And it so happened that after President Nixon had taken office, the Secretary of Treasury, John Connolly came to the President and said: Mr. President, a lot of people have given you a lot of money. You haven't met them, you haven't shaken their hands, you haven't been able to thank them. I think it would be in order for you to come down to the ranch. I will put it on at the ranch. 
   Nixon said: Fine business, that's what we will do. 
   A few weeks later, they turned into the ranch. But as they turned into the ranch in Texas, there was old Dick Tuck with the Brinks truck--you know the prankster from the Kennedy years. My heavens, the Government was up for sale. We were all embarrassed, Republican and Democrat. We got to the floor and presented the 1974 Campaign Practices Act--we said to our friend, the Senator from Massachusetts: You can't buy it. We looked over there to the Senator from New York, Mr. Buckley and he said: You can't tell me. I am going to buy it. We passed it with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. But Senator Buckley then sued the Secretary of the Senate and took it all the way to the Supreme Court. That is where 
   we got this distortion which causes the corruption. It was by one vote, 5-4. 
   If you want to raid the erudite decisions on this particular matter, read Justice White and Justice Marshall in the dissenting opinion. They foresaw this corruption in the process, where we can't get anything done, where we have the unmitigated gall to stand up and say: I am going to buy this office. Of course, they say: Freedom of speech; freedom of speech. Nobody is listening to that. I never thought the day would come when they would stand on the floor and proudly say, ``I am going to buy the office,'' or a particular party would come and say, ``We are going to buy the Presidency.'' That is exactly what they have done. The Republican Party said: Get out of the way, Steve Forbes, and all the rest of you; we are going to get our candidate, Governor Bush down in Texas, and we are going to raise him $70 million. He has already spent $63 million, and it is only March. We have almost 7 or 8 months to go before the election. They are not worried about that. We just never did think. 
   I can see Senator Long of Louisiana. Every mother's son ought to be able to run for the Presidency. That is why we have the checkoff on the income tax return and the matching funds for those who qualify. We thought that was good and plenty. But they spent, by the first of March, $63 million, and they will spend another $63 million very easily. That crowd has an investment. 
   If I were going to run for the Presidency, I would run on one particular message: Let the people of America know here and now this office is not for sale. That ought to be a fundamental Americanism--that you can't buy the office. 
   Now, we have several in the body who had millions in their campaigns and have gotten to the Senate. I will say in the same breath, I look at them and their service, and they would have done the same without the millions, but they did spend millions to get here. That is the kind of body we are turning it into more and more each year. You can't consider anything. You can't debate anything. You can't take time to speak to your colleagues. It is a veritable money chase. 
   That is exactly why we are not doing anything this year. It is the year 2000, the year that the U.S. Congress squats and does nothing. There is an old political axiom: When in doubt, do nothing, and stay in doubt all the time. That reelects a lot of people. That is what we are motivated by on this particular afternoon. 
   I am going into the details of the amendment again out of necessity and will emphasize why we need a constitutional amendment, because we have tried it every other way. The Court has found, more and more, free speech implications in any and all legislation. Unless we can amend the Constitution to extract this cancer and this corruption from the body politic, we are goners. I can tell you that democracy is gone. 
   I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. He is so learned in the law and so long on common sense. He just laid out what the situation is and how we are going about, in a very deliberate, constitutional way, repairing the tremendous damage done by Buckley v. Valeo. 
   There is no question about the process being corrupted. He mentioned a minute ago that I have been here since 1966. I have been here when we have had everybody here at 5:30 and we would debate these things and, yes, on a Monday. But we do not meet on Mondays. Why? Because we have been corrupted by the money chase. 
   I have gone to the leaders on both sides: Give me a window; how about seeing if we do not go late on Thursday night because I have to get back to South Carolina for a fundraiser. Every Senator has done it. We are not here on Monday. We are not here on Friday. In 1966 and 1967, under Senator Mansfield, I can tell you right now, we worked until late Friday afternoon and we reported back for rollcalls at 9 o'clock on Monday morning. 
   We worked the full time. We worked the full months. We did not have January off and then another big break in February and another break in March and another break in April and another break in May-June and another break of a month in August. Why the breaks? To raise the money. If you are not raising it for yourself, you are supposed to go out and raise it for your colleagues. 
   The whole process has been corrupted. Recognize it. We cannot get a bill. We cannot get debate. We cannot talk to each other. Nobody is here. They are not expected to be here. TV has corrupted that. If one wanted to know what was going on in the Chamber, they had to get out of their office and come to the floor. We always had 15 or 20 Members on one side and 20 or 30 Members on the other side listening and joining in, and we had debates on serious matters. We debated. The most deliberative body in the world was our reputation. 
   Now we do not bring up a serious matter unless it is fixed. We cannot produce a budget unless the vote is fixed in the Budget Committee, and when they can get it through it is late Thursday evening, when it is quite obvious none of the amendments are going to be adopted. The vote is fixed. The jury is fixed. There is no deliberation. They will bring that up, and then they have fixed time on it. 
   Go to the leader and say: We want to take up this measure, and it takes 3 or 4 days; and he will look at you as if you are stupid: Don't you know better, we don't have time to deliberate, we don't have time to debate. 
   The system is corrupted. Get a life. Get along. Go out. Collect some money. After all, it is the money chase. We have to work for ourselves to stay in office or to keep our colleagues in office. That is the name of the game. 
   Important issues, I can go down the list--but when they want money, oh, wait a minute, there is an exception. That sham, that fraud, that charade of Y2K. For 30 years, the computer industry had 
   notice of the year 2000. For 30 years, they all could have changed. They still have 7 months or so to change. 
   There was a big debate. Why? Because the lawyers got the Chamber of Commerce to gin up Silicon Valley. The gentleman from Intel told me there was not a real problem, and everybody else said there was not a real problem. But we had a problem. It was a money chase for getting Silicon Valley's money in Y2K, and the media covered it: How much Bush had received, how much Gore had received, how much this group had received, and we continue to invite Silicon Valley here for special sessions. We are really interested. 
   That is not middle America, and they are not going to create our industrial backbone. We admire their ingenuity and their talent. We are not jealous of the money. Let them all make millions. We just want our share. 
   Y2K came, and we passed it. Nothing happened. In opposition to the States, in opposition to the States' supreme court justices, in opposition to the American Bar Association, we repealed 200 years of State tort law. Why? Because of the money. Why, we spent 4 days on that one. That was highly important. Just put up a straw man, knock it down, and then go home, boldly and proudly saying: Look what we have done; we took care of Y2K. 
   Yet, on the other hand, if we have a real problem, they will not call it up. Why? On account of the money. I have a TV violence bill. There is no mystery to this. Europe, Australia, and New Zealand do not have children shooting each other in schools. They have a safe harbor practice so that violence appears on television after hours. 
   I introduced the same thing, and it was in the Commerce Committee in the last two Congresses. Senator Dole was there. When he went out to the west coast, he came back and said: Oh, this is terrible. I said: Senator Dole, why don't you be the chief sponsor, you run it, you take credit for it. It has already been debated and we have had testimony on it, and it was reported out by a vote of 19-1 from the Commerce Committee. It is on the calendar. Call it. 
   Oh, no, it wasn't called. We needed the Hollywood money. I have it on the calendar now. Again, we debated it. We brought out the study the industry conducted, and the motion picture industry itself found that violence was on the rise. 
   It is a real problem in this country, but we talk a little bit here and there. When we want to get a tried and true approach and it is on the calendar, they say: Wait a minute, don't call that, let's not debate it. 
   It is not called up because of the money. This attitude has corrupted the process, and we have a gang over there that loves the corruption. They come here with their octopus defense. I have seen it before. We used to try cases, and if you do not have the facts and you do not have the lawyer beaten on the desk, you squirt out that dark ink of freedom of speech, first amendment, 2,000 years, 20,000 amendments. This is a shocking thing. 
   They were not shocked when the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo came down because that decision is what amended the freedom of speech. It said: If you have the money, you have all the speech you want. If you don't have the money, you get lockjaw. Shut up. You don't have speech. 
   In that Buckley v. Valeo decision, read what they said in this distortion: ``Money is property; it is not speech,'' said Justice Stevens. 
   Then Justice Kennedy:  
   The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented in Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the political system. It is covert speech.  
   This is, of course, the famous case of Nixon v. Shrink, the most recent decision of this Court:   
   The Court has forced a substantial amount of political speech underground, as contributors and candidates devise ever more elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no account of rising campaign costs. The preferred method has been to conceal the real purpose of the speech...... 
   Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted, see Buckley, supra, at 42-44, while straightforward speech in the form of financial contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject to full disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not. Thus has the Court's decision given us covert speech. This mocks the First Amendment.  
   That is what Justice Kennedy talks about. That is what I am talking about. Don't give me this: Freedom of speech and first amendment. What a shocking thing it is with that black ink like the octopus, putting up all the billboards about the freedom of the press and how people want editorial writers to be equally Democratic and Republican--what kind of nonsense is all of that? And what about getting up and saying: All I want is for you to register and vote. 
   Quoting further:  
   The current system would be unfortunate, and suspect under the First Amendment, had it evolved from a deliberate legislative choice; but its unhappy origins are in our earlier decree in Buckley, which by accepting half of what Congress did (limiting contributions) but rejecting the other (limiting expenditures) created a misshapen system, one which distorts the meaning of speech.  
   The Senator from North Dakota said: Let's don't do it lightly. Let's don't amend the Constitution willy-nilly. I agree. But what about when you have a threat to the democracy, to the Republic itself, this corruption of the process here, where the Congress does nothing because of the money chase that we are in. 
   Quoting further:  
   The irony that we would impose this regime in the name of free speech ought to be sufficient ground to reject Buckley's wooden formula in the present case. The wrong goes deeper, however. By operation of the Buckley rule, a candidate cannot oppose this system in an effective way without selling out to it first.  
   We all have to sell out. I am running around trying to get money to help my colleagues right this minute.  
   Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft money.  
   Listen to this sentence:  
   In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling from change.  
   Let me quote that one more time:  
   In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling from change.  
   That is why you need a constitutional amendment. That is why we are here. If you enjoy the corruption, if you want to continue on, not being able to debate anything around here, not having to 
   amend, just going through the motions of arriving and going home, and getting another break and going home to collect some more money, and coming back and going back to collect more money, and acting as if you are doing the people's business--it is an embarrassment. 
   They sure know embarrassment when they try to equate it with free speech, when they can jump on Vice President GORE and the Buddhist temple. The Christian right, that fellow Pat Robertson with the Christian right, I have had to face that insidious trickery in all of my campaigns--that Bob Jones crowd. I am glad it is out from under the radar. 
   Let me tell you, it has been going on. I wish Senator MCCAIN had had a chance to get organized in the State because that is the only way I survived. You have to sort of out-organize it. But they had Ralph Reed in there, and he had been working in there since last June. He had it all greased. 
   They had the poor Senator from Arizona's family in the Mafia. They had him fathering illegitimate children. And he was in prison. They had him getting along with the North Vietnamese and going against the veterans. They had more dirty rumors--totally false--of anything you can think of. I mean, you never heard such things. He had no chance. 
   The Christian right and Pat Robertson: They come on Sunday. They brag. I can show you the statement, 75 million leaflets. They come out and give them out to the church on Sunday morning. They distort your record, and everything else of that kind. You cannot answer because the vote is on Tuesday. 
   He said he spent $500,000 carrying Virginia for George W. Bush. Pat Robertson, he gets respect. He's on TV. We think that is great. He is a bum, I can tell you. I know him. I knew his father Willis. He was a real gentleman. Willis Robertson was one of the finest gentlemen you would ever meet. That fellow is a scoundrel, whining and weaseling and dealing around. 
   But then, of course, the poor Buddhists, they want to get in the act. There is nothing wrong with the Buddhists getting in the act. They tell me now what had happened is that this young lady, she had gotten contributions from everybody and then reimbursed them. They found her guilty of the--what?--contributions, not of free speech. 
   See, when we find Johnny Huang guilty, that is in violation of the contribution laws. That is not free speech. That is money. Oh, boy, I wish I was a lawyer before the jury with that crowd. 
   When they held the committee here with Charlie Trie, we had the Governmental Affairs Committee conduct the activities. I do not know how many months, but 70 witnesses, 200 witness interviews, 196 depositions under oath, 418 subpoenas, with a final report published in 1998 with six volumes, 9,575 pages--about contributions, not free speech. 
   But now this afternoon, we pushed that aside. The Senator from Texas says, You Democrats have all the labor unions and we have the corporate money. However, in South Carolina, I don't have either one. So let me give you George W. Bush's statement on soft money, because he's an authority on the subject. 
   This is on January 23. George Will, questioning Governor Bush:  
   In which case would you veto the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-Meehan bill?  
   Governor Bush:  
   That is an interesting question. Yes, I would. And the reason why is two for one. And I think it does restrict--  
   I am quoting it verbatim here as written.  
   --free speech for individuals. As I understand how the bill was written, I think there has been two versions of it. But as I understand, the first version restricted individuals and/or groups from being able to express their opinion. I've always said that I think corporate soft money and labor union soft money--which I do not believe is individual free speech, this is collected free speech--ought to be banned. 
   We have Vice President GORE. He got the message about the corruption. He said: The first thing I will do when I am your President is submit to Congress the McCain-Feingold bill. 
   The people are tired of this political mess up here. I am tired of being a part of it. They will hear from me again and again. The reason you hadn't heard about it is that they forbid a joint resolution from coming up. I studied the calendar and waited for a joint resolution so that my joint resolution won't be objected to on a point of order. It is finally in order and so we can hear it. But then I had to go along or else I wouldn't have had a chance to introduce it at all because then they would have brought the flag amendment up and the cloture vote. 
   So you bag around here, this most deliberative body, for an hour or 2 hours to get some work done and nobody is here. Nobody wants to be here because they are supposed to be out raising money and having fundraisers and breakfasts in the morning and windows at lunchtime and in the evening. It's taking a few hours on Wednesday afternoon to call on behalf of your campaign committee and come up with thousands of dollars, your fair share. It is money, money, money, money. It is corruption. 
   You tell me about the Washington Post; that crowd still calls the deficit a surplus. You tell me about the ACLU and all these other authorities running around and the scare tactics, that octopus defense, and the dark ink and all of those other irrelevant matters. We are talking sense. We are talking law. We are talking about what the Justices have just stated. There is no question why Justice Stevens said money is property and not speech. He was only one of the nine. The others could have gone along and reversed Buckley, and we would be out of this dilemma. We would go back to the original intent, which was to control spending. Now we are proudly hollering about this and that and freedoms, and now we are going to take the newspapers and do away with the editorialists and control  the press. This amendment doesn't use the word ``speech.'' It says ``contributions.'' It is money. That is exactly what we have controlled throughout and that is what is intended. 
   The Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, stood up there and started reading this. He said that is limiting speech. It is not limiting speech. You can't limit speech. But you can limit the freedom of the contributions. You and I know that. That is what we are trying to do. 
   Under the 1974 act that computed spending limits by the number of registered voters, Senator THURMOND and I would have had $670,000. Double that to a million or a half or give us 2.5 million. That is a gracious plenty. When I first ran for office I ran against a millionaire--a most respected gentleman, but he had the money. But we outworked him, just like we out-organized my opponent the year before last in South Carolina. That is why I am still here and able to talk. 
   I don't buy cars in campaigns, but it was suggested that a lot of other candidates do. When they rent, lease, and then later buy a piece of property, all of that is not freedom of speech. That is money. It is contributions. It is where you ought to try to control the spending limits so we don't become a bunch of millionaires and instead go back to what Russell Long said: Every mother's son would be able to run for the highest office in the land. 
   I could go on and on. The afternoon is late. To repeal the first amendment, the Senator from Washington turned to the Senator from Kentucky and said, read that word, that is to ``repeal'' the first amendment. Now, if you believe that, you go ahead and vote against this. But you know and I know, it is to repeal the corruption. That is what I am about; I am trying to repeal the corruption. I am trying to get back to the original intent. Yes, you might say we had 38 votes. I remember when we had 52 votes, a majority, for this. I remember when I had a dozen Republican cosponsors. 
   I admire my colleague from Pennsylvania for sticking with me on this, making it bipartisan. But I don't know of another one over there, because they have been disciplined and put right into the trough and told: You stick with us. This is a party vote, and this is it. It is freedom of speech and don't you forget it. 
   It is not freedom of speech. It is money. We are trying to control the purchase of the office. We are trying to correct the corruption. We are trying to get back to our work on behalf of the people, which is very difficult to do with the pressures now on Senators up here. It is disgraceful. It is absolutely disgraceful. Everybody knows it. I want somebody to contest it. They are not around. They are not going to contest it. They are going to make these comments about so many years and so many amendments and the freedom of speech and the hallowed document and everything else. 
   I have gone down five of the last six amendments; all had to do with elections, less important than this corruption to be corrected, far less a threat. I admit, recognize, agree with the Senator from North Dakota that we shouldn't do it lightly, and we are not doing it lightly. If it was only a minor problem, whereby we could merely pass a statute, I would do it. But all of these statutes, McCain-Feingold, as the Senator from Kentucky has contended each time, is patently unconstitutional. You can tell from reading this most recent decision on soft money how they are equating everything with speech. You can see how they have immunized their mistake from change. Those are not my words. Those are Justice Kennedy's words. They have ``immunized'' their mistake from change. 
   So we have to have a constitutional amendment. This is written very carefully, very deliberately, and very reasonably, where we don't take sides one way or the other, whether you are for or against McCain-Feingold, whether you are for or against free TV time, whether you are for or against public financing, whether you are for or against your idea you have on campaign finance. This will constitutionalize it so we can quit this sham of beating around the bush. It is hit and run driving with a, yes, I am for reform, knowing good and well that the Court is going to throw it out when it gets there. So we can find out who is who and what is what. I understand that this corruption should cease. 
   I want to complete the thought I was making with respect to various comments of the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, who said they are being denied under the Hollings amendment the right to speak at all. Not so. The person being denied the right to speak at all in political campaigns is the individual without the money. 
   Take a campaign against a very affluent or wealthy person, and they buy up all the time. At the end, you do not have the money to match it. The TV station calls you and says: Here are all of these time slots gotten by your opponent, and you have the right to equal it. I don't have the money. Before long, with all of the friends, the family says: Well, I don't understand why John doesn't answer him. He is not interested in this race. He is not working. He looks slovenly. Why? Because he doesn't have the money. 
   That is the point. Right now, I am trying to prepare, along with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, for being denied the right to speak at all. That is under the Buckley v. Valeo decision. If you have money, you can speak until the sky is the limit and for how long your money will take you. If you do not have the money, you have the right to get lockjaw, shut up, and sit down, that ends it, because 85 percent of your money goes to television and you are not there. 
   The people do not know you are in the race. They keep talking about repealing the first amendment. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT, said that limiting candidates would give special interests more power. It would create a vacuum, and the special interest would fill the vacuum. There isn't any vacuum, except for the poor. The special interests are in there to the tune of millions and millions. That is what we all know. We are trying to limit the special interests. We are not trying to create a vacuum they can fill. 
   That is exactly the point of this particular amendment. You go over again and again. They raise these straw men of exactly the opposite of what is intended and what is provided for in the Hollings-Specter amendment; namely, to limit spending in Federal elections, and limit spending, of course, in State elections. 
   With respect to the cases, I cited the case where the individual got caught trying to go around. I refer now to James W. Brosnan's article in The Commercial Appeal dated November 8, 1998. 
   The indictment of Chattanooga developer Franklin Haney highlights what some campaign reformers believe could be a frequent, but hard to prove, crime--companies reimbursing their employees for contributions. 
   The indictment charges that Haney and his administrative assistant, who was not named in the indictment, instructed company employees to make contributions of $1,000 apiece, filled out the donor cards themselves and then wrote Haney Company checks to reimburse the employees.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the pertinent part. 
   Simon Fireman, a national vice chairman of Dole's campaign, funneled $100,000 into Dole's campaign using employees of his company, Aqua Leisure Industries of Avon, MA. He paid a $6 million fine. 
   Empire Sanitary Landfill of Scranton, PA, pleaded guilty to contributing $110,000 to Dole and other Republican campaigns through employees and paid an $8 million fine. 
   Independent counsel Donald Smaltz was appointed to investigate Mike Espy, which we all know about. 
   I don't know what happened to Haney, or whether or not he was found innocent. But let's assume so. I am not trying to disparage. I am just trying to say here is the corruption that actually goes on. 
   In one case, lobbyist Jim Lake arranged for a $5,000 contribution to the 1994 Mississippi congressional campaign of Espy's brother and then padded his expense account to get the money back. He was fined $150,000 and ordered to write and send descriptions of the campaign finance law to 2,000 lobbyists. 
   Another New Orleans attorney, Alvarez Ferrouilet, was sentenced to 1 year in prison for disguising $20,000 in illegal contributions to Espy. 
   The other cases have resulted in fines of $1.5 million against Sun-Diamond Growers, $480,000 against Sun-Land Products, $80,000 against American Family Life Assurance Company, and $2 million against the Crop Growers Corporation. 
   This corruption is rampant, and you can't stop it unless you get this constitutional amendment. Everyone understands what Justice Kennedy said--that you are not going to have this covert speech. You are not going around, and you are not going to employees, because the name of the game is--I know because I ran for President. I know one State that I believe I could have taken, but the one who succeeded in taking it spent x thousands of dollars above the limit. It was 2 years later they found out that he spent over the limit. That was the end of that. 
   What I am saying is, you can't control this. It is a Federal election campaign practices commission because it is all ex post facto. It is lost in the dust. 
   This has been going on, particularly with you and I serving in the Senate. We can't talk sense, we can't debate, we can't get measures up, and we can't deliberate because we have been corrupted by the money chase. 
   Mondays and Fridays, gone; Tuesday morning, gone; windows here and there and yonder for lunches, dinners, fund raisers, breaks now every month of the year. Why: They go raise some more money, and we are not getting the work of the people done. 
   I was here when it worked, when we met at 9 o'clock on Monday morning. Nobody was here at 9 o'clock this Monday morning. Nobody is here now because they are all out raising money. I can tell you, we worked until Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock. Ask Senator BYRD. He remembers. He knows how hard we worked in those days when he was leader. 
   But the system and the Buckley v. Valeo cancer are overtaking all of us. We are all part of it. I have asked for windows, and I have had to chase at holidays. I continue to do so. I am saying to myself and to all of us that it is time we sort of fess up and understand that this has to stop. We have to start working on behalf of the people and not ourselves. Let's do away with the corruption. Let's get back to the original intent of Buckley v. Valeo, which was totally bipartisan and overwhelmingly passed. That was to limit spending or stop the buying of the office. 
   We had that enough in 1978, which I explained because I know what was called upon in cash moneys in my particular State. It was listed all over the country. Connolly asked the President, and he went down to collect. They put up with Dick Tuck in the Brinks truck as it turned into the ranch in order to have the barbecue so the President could thank his contributors whom he had not even met. 
   We all were so embarrassed. It is bad when there is not even any embarrassment in this body. The corruption is exacerbated. I learned that word having come to Washington--``exacerbate.'' It continues to exacerbate, and it gets worse and worse. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize one of Charleston, South Carolina's finest and feistiest community activists, Thelma ``TC'' Drayton. People who have known my friend TC over the years will tell you that nothing, and I mean nothing, stands in her way in spurring the East Side community to action. Thanks in large part to TC's hurricane-force commitment, the at-risk neighborhood where she has lived for 53 years is cleaner, safer and more in control of its destiny. Last week, the community acknowledged her many contributions when Agape Ministries established the TC Drayton Award for volunteerism to be presented each year. 
   Volunteers in search of encouragement during tough times need look no further than TC's example. Like Charleston's East Side, which developers have begun to acquire an appetite for, TC Drayton is up against a formidable foe these days. She is fighting her battle against lung cancer with characteristic force and optimism. She hopes to retire from her job as community liaison with the city of Charleston and devote more time to volunteer  projects. One that is closest to her heart is a new Agape project known as COAT--Coalition of Older Americans Task Force. TC has always been quick to lend a hand to older members of her church family at Friendship Baptist and would like to extend her reach to other seniors in need. 
   We all wish TC a speedy recovery and a chance to touch even more lives in Charleston. She is a credit to South Carolina, deserving of all the accolades that she receives.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman, Senator ROCKEFELLER. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, appropriately known as the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, or FAIR-21. This legislation rightfully deserves this title for two basic reasons: it represents a fair compromise and it honors the former Chairman and later ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Ford. 
   Before commenting on the substantive provisions of the conference agreement, I think it is essential to commend those who are responsible for achieving the compromise we have before us. However, because of the number of individuals who have been instrumental in forging this agreement, engaging in this exercise is sort of like the Academy Awards shows, where the winner gets to list all of the people he needs to thank in 30 seconds. I believe FEDEX had a commercial a few years ago with a fast talking person, and I shall try to do the same here. First, I wish to commend Chairman SHUSTER, Congressman OBERSTAR, and Senators ROCKEFELLER and GORTON for their unflagging leadership in reaching this agreement. I should note that Senator LOTT left no stones unturned to move this bill. As well, Senators STEVENS and DOMENICI played pivotal roles. All of the Conferees and their staff did their part to accomplish an enormous task. After much hard work and many long hours we have a good, strong bill, which addresses many of the most critical aviation issues facing us today --the proper funding for the modernization of our air traffic control system and airport infrastructure. 
   Before explaining a little about the bill, I want to address one of the concerns that has been raised. I know that Senator LAUTENBERG has concerns about this bill and what it means for other programs. The reality is that for years we have underfunded the FAA, despite the fact that the Airport and Airways Trust Fund has acummulated an uncommitted surplus, approximating $7-8 billion per year. The surplus is currently at $13 billion. Essentially, we have used those monies to meet other priorities. Today, we end that game, by making sure that all monies in the Trust Fund go to aviation. We also recognize that if more is needed, and it will be, then the general fund will be called upon. Bear in mind that the FAA and its ATC system provide services not only to the commerical and general aviation fleets, but also to our military. The FAA also plays a key role in our national security by keeping our skies and airports safe. 
   We know that when the Trust Fund was created in 1970, it was intended solely for modernization/capital improvements. The preamble to the statute was as valid then as it is today--it reads ``That the Nation's airport and airways system is inadequate to meet the current and projected growth in aviation. That substantial expansion and improvement of airport and airway system is required to meet the demands of interstate commerce, the postal service and national defense''. In fact, to clarify that it was intended for capital only, Congress in 1971 deleted the phrase ``administrative expenses'' as an eligible item for spending. During the first years of the Trust Fund, with one year's exception, no Trust Fund monies were spent on the general operations of the FAA. In 1977, Congress allowed left over funds to be used for salaries and expenses of the FAA. Today, we are returning to the original intent--monies first for capital needs, with any remaing funds to be used for other expenses. If a general fund is needed, then it will be subject to appropriations. 
   We have little choice. There is no question we must invest in our future. We must expand the system to keep it safe, and to make it more efficient. There is one other point--modernization of the ATC system involves not only Federal spending, but also a committment from the private sector. As we move to a satellite-based system, the air carriers and general aviation must make an investment in new technology in the cockpit. Finally, it is my understanding that the Transportation function 400 numbers in the Budget resolution will reflect the agreement reached here today, which should quell some of the concerns of my colleague from New Jersey. 
   Aviation is an integral part of the overall U.S. transportation infrastructure and plays a critical role in our national economy. Each day our air transportation system moves millions of people and billions of dollars of cargo. The U.S. commercial aviation industry recorded its fifth consecutive year of traffic growth, while the general aviation industry enjoyed a banner year in shipments and aircraft activity at FAA air traffic facilities. Continued economic expansion in the U.S. and around the globe will continue to fuel the exponential growth in domestic and international enplanements. 
   The FAA is forecasting that by 2009, enplanements are expected to grow to more than 1 billion by 2009, compared to 650 million last year. During this time, total International passenger traffic between the United States and the rest of the world is projected to increase 82.6 percent. International passenger traffic carried on U.S. Flag carriers is forecast to increase 94.2 percent. These percentages represent a dramatic increase in the actual number of people using the air system. 
   More people, more planes, more delays. Those are the headlines we know are coming. We know today that the growth in air travel has placed a strain on the aviation system and our own nerves as we travel. In 1998, 25% of flights by major air carriers were delayed. MITRE, the FAA's federally-funded research and development organization, estimates that just to maintain delays at current levels in 2015, a 60% increase in airport capacity will be needed. As many of you may know, 
   and perhaps have experienced first hand, delays reached an all-time high this summer. These delays are inordinately costly to both the carriers and the traveling public; in fact, according to the Air Transport Association, delays cost the airlines and travelers more than $4 billion per year. 
   We cannot ignore the numbers. These statistics underscore the necessity of  properly funding our investment--we must modernize our Air Traffic Control system and expand our airport infrastructure. Gridlock in the skies is a certainty unless the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system is modernized. A system-wide delay increase of just a few minutes per flight will bring commercial operations to a halt according to the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and American Airlines. According to a study by the White House Commission on Aviation Security and Safety, dated January 1997, the modernization of the ATC system should be expedited to completion by 2005 instead of 2015. 
   FAIR 21 would authorize the Facilities and Equipment (ATC equipment) at $2.660 billion, $2.914 billion, and $2.981 billion for FY01-FY03, respectively. This represents a 30% increase in funding. For the first time ever, FAIR 21 links the spending in the Facilities and Equipment account and the Airport Improvement Program to the monies in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. 
   As our skies and runways become more crowded than ever, it is crucial that we redouble our commitment to safety. Passengers deserve the most up to date in safety measures. FAIR-21 ensures that there will be money available to pay for new runway incursion devices as well as windshear detection equipment. The bill requires all large cargo airplanes install collision avoidance equipment. In an effort to support the ongoing improvements at civil and cargo airports, FAIR-21 increases funding for the improvement of training for security screeners. We also have provided whistleblower protection to aid in our safety efforts and protect workers willing to expose safety problems. 
   FAIR 21 will allow airports to increase their passenger facility charges from $3 to $4.50. This is a local choice and it is money which an airport can use to encourage new entry, particularly at the 15 ``fortress hubs'' where one carrier controls more than 50% of the traffic. Logically, the air fares for the communities dependant upon these hubs are much higher than usual. If given a choice, perhaps we would have broken up the hubs. Instead, we have used the power of the dollar and a half to require these hubs to develop ways to allow new carriers to expand as to create the possibility of lower fares to places like Charleston, SC. The extra buck and a half will go to expand gates and terminal areas, as well as runways at these facilities. 
   Since 1996, we have struggled with how to develop meaningful reform of the FAA. We have met the majority of the suggestions with the exception of the recommendations to establish a fee system and to set up a private corporation to run air traffic control. Instead, we chose a more prudent path. The 1996 reauthorization bill established a 15 member Management Advisory Committee (MAC) appointed by the President with Senate confirmation but no one has yet to be named. Jane Garvey, the FAA Administrator, is doing a wonderful job, but she could have used some help. To avoid this in the future, FAIR-21 establishes a subcommittee of the MAC to oversee air traffic operations with the appointments being made by the Secretary of Transportation rather than the President. The bill also establishes a position for a chief operating officer. Combined with other measures, and the funding levels, we are on the right track. 
   I wish to say a word about our controllers, technicians and the FAA workforce. I know that the bill as crafted does not guarantee a general fund contribution to pay for the operations of the FAA. However, it should be acknowledged that these folks work hard every day to keep us flying safely. The safety of the nation is in their hands. They deserve our support. 
   Finally but not least, in terms of Death on the High Seas, after much input from the families of the victims of many of the air tragedies, we have clarified the law and extending the borders of the United States to 12 miles off shore for the purpose of determining claims. In the case of an accident occurring 12 miles or within the shore, the Death on the High Seas Act shall not apply. Rather, it is state, federal, and any other applicable laws which shall apply. Death on the High Seas shall apply only outside of 12 miles off shore. 
   Mr. President, let me commend Mr. SHUSTER, the chairman on the House side. He stuck to his guns. 
   It has been a long struggle in the open and in the dark. I only mention that because my colleague from New Jersey said this thing was all agreed to in the dark. We have been in the dark and in the open and everything else for 2 years on this struggle. 
   Mr. SHUSTER stuck to his guns, whereby those air travelers who obtain the taxes that go into the airport and airways improvement fund are finally being assured that money is going to be spent on the airport and airways improvement. 
   Right to the point: We owe some $12 billion right this minute for airport taxes that have been used for everything from Kosovo to food stamps, and everything else but airport and airways improvement. 
   In fact, we now have some $l.95 billion to be expended this fiscal year, 2000. We were unable to get those moneys, although they were in the fund, supposedly--IOU slips, if you will. We are now able to spend those moneys. 
   I have the same misgivings the ranking member of our subcommittee has about the shortfalls in the operating budget. That is due to so-called ``unrealistic spending caps.'' That is a budget problem--not this bill's problem. There is a problem with unrealistic spending caps. 
   There is state-of-the-art equipment sitting in warehouses, and that is because we have been playing a sordid game of trying to call a ``deficit'' a ``surplus'' and grabbing any and all moneys we can to play a game to make it look as if we are reducing spending. The fact is the President submits his budget, and we in the Congress--this Republican Congress, if you please--have been increasing spending over and above what President Clinton has asked for during the past 7 or 8 years. We are not willing to pay for it. So we rob Social Security. We rob the retirement of the military and civil service. We robbed the highway funds, up until we finally got that straightened out under the leadership of Mr. SHUSTER. Now we can hold onto our airport moneys and do the job that is required of us. 
   I want to say to everyone involved that this has been a good 2-year struggle to get us where we are. It is a good bill. It was developed in a bipartisan way, with every consideration given to not only the budget problems and concern the Senator from New Jersey has, but also my concerns about overall air traffic. 
   We are moving finally in the right direction. I hope everybody will vote in support of the conference report. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator THURMOND, introduce a series of duty suspensions designed to permit the import of raw materials into the United States duty free. The materials are not indigenous to or made in the United States. Therefore, their importation will not displace domestic sourcing. Moreover, because of the nature of the products at issue, they will assist in the creation of additional jobs in the United States. 
   I believe this is the most appropriate use of such legislation. The imported product will not displace any that is manufactured in the United States. Moreover, the imported product will assist in enhancing American productive capacity. I am, therefore, hopeful that this new capacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will increase employment in the United States.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the reason I asked for the extra time is, in addressing the Senate with respect to the Education Savings Act, I was going to make the point that we weren't saving and we had no money for this particular act. The act will cost the government $2 billion. But the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of our Budget Committee, says the Senator from South Carolina sees the surplus differently than he sees a surplus. Let me go right to the minute here on 2/23, the public debt to the penny. 
   You can go to the Internet and, under the law, find that the Department of Treasury lists to the penny and by the minute the exact amount of the public debt. It isn't what the Senator from New Mexico calls a debt or surplus. It isn't what the Senator from South Carolina calls a debt or surplus. It is what we call a debt under the Public Law. The public debt to the minute right now--I just took it off the Internet two minutes ago--is $5,744,135,736,409.24 
   I ask unanimous consent to print this in the RECORD at this point.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention an article from today's TheStreet.Com entitled ``DoubleClick Exec Says Privacy Legislation Needn't Crimp Results.'' For many Americans, the fear of a loss of personal privacy on the Internet represents the last hurdle impeding their full embrace of this exciting and promising new medium. In addition, many other Internet users unfortunately are today unaware of the significant amount of information profiling that is occurring every time they visit a web site. Notwithstanding the significant privacy concerns raised by such surreptitious activity, many companies continue to oppose even a basic regulatory framework that would ensure the protection of consumers' privacy on the Internet--a basic framework that has been successfully adopted with respect to other areas of our economy. That is why I was so pleased to see a leading Internet Executive from DoubleClick state that his company would not ``face an insurmountable problem'' in attempting to operate under strict privacy rules. Complying with such rules is ``not rocket science,'' the executive stated, ``It's execution.'' Obviously, what this gentleman has asserted is that strict privacy rules would not impede the basic functionality and commercial activity on the Internet. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to draft legislation in this area and hope that others in industry will join DoubleClick's apparent willingness to implement pro-consumer privacy rules.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in my over 33 years' experience as a Senator with over 30 years on Defense Appropriations, I have worked with a good eight to ten Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and, of course, their numerous counterparts from the House side. One constant thread of dedication and stability in our national defense has been DANIEL INOUYE from Hawaii. His tremendous sacrifice for the security of this nation was recognized with a Distinguished Service Cross. All of us engaged in World War II will tell you that the citation deserves Medal of Honor recognition, but it was not to be because he was a member of the Nisei fighters, the Japanese-American unit that had to fight the U.S. authorities first before it could fight the enemy. Now, in peacetime, Senator INOUYE has been the stalwart for the strong defense of this nation. 
   This week, the Ambassador of Japan, Shunji Yanai, presented Senator INOUYE with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, one of the Japanese government's highest honors, citing in particular his work fostering good relations between the United States and Japan. I can think of no one more deserving of this honor. Senator INOUYE has demonstrated the same courage, character and leadership here in Washington that he did as a soldier. I offer him my heartfelt congratulations on this distinguished recognition.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if people back home only knew. This whole town is engaged in the biggest fraud. Tom Brokaw has written that the greatest generation suffered the Depression, won the war, and then came back to lead. They not only won the war but were conscientious about paying for that war and Korea and Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1969. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the record of all the Presidents, since President Truman down through President Clinton, of the deficit and debt, the national debt, and interest costs.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1969. At that time, the national debt was $365 billion with an interest cost of only $16 billion. Now, under a new generation without the cost of a war, the debt has soared to $5.6 trillion with annual interest costs of $365 billion. That is right. We spend $1 billion a day for nothing. It does not buy any defense, any education, any health care, or highways. Astoundingly, since President Johnson balanced the budget, we have increased spending $349 billion for nothing. 
   Early each morning, the Federal Government goes down to the bank and borrows $1 billion and adds it to the national debt. We have not had a surplus for 30 years. Senator TRENT LOTT, commenting on President Clinton's State of the Union Address, said the talk cost $1 billion a minute. For an hour-and-a-half talk, that would be $90 billion a year. Governor George W. Bush's tax cut costs $90 billion a year. Together, that is $180 billion. Just think, we can pay for both the Democratic and Republican programs with the money we are spending on interest and still have $185 billion to pay down the national debt. Instead, the debt increases, interest costs increase, while all in town, all in the Congress, shout: Surplus, surplus, surplus. 
   Understand the game. Ever since President Johnson's balanced budget, the Government has spent more each year than it has taken in--a deficit. The average deficit for the past 30 years was $175 billion a year. This is with both Democratic and Republican Presidents and Democratic and Republican Congresses. Somebody wants to know why the economy is good? If you infuse $175 billion a year for some 30 years and do not pay for it, it ought to be good. 
   The trick to calling a deficit a surplus is to have the Government borrow from itself. The Federal Government, like an insurance company, has various funds held in reserve to pay benefits of the program--Social Security, Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment compensation, highway funds, airport funds, railroad retirement funds. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a list of trust funds looted to balance this budget.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, these funds are held in trust for the specific purpose for which the taxes are collected. 
   Under corporate law, it is a felony to pay off the company debt with the pension fund. But in Washington we pay down the public debt with trust funds, call it a surplus, and they give us the ``Good Government'' award. 
   To make it sound correct, we divide the debt in two: The public debt and the private debt. Of course, our Government is public, and the law treats the debt as public without separation. The separation allows Washington politicians to say: We have paid down the public debt and have a surplus. There is no mention, of course, that the Government debt is increased by the same amount that the public debt is decreased. It is like paying off your MasterCard with your Visa card and saying you do not owe anything. Dr. Dan Crippen, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, describes this as ``taking from one pocket and putting it in the other.'' 
   For years we have been using the trust funds to report a unified budget and a unified deficit. This has led people to believe the Government was reporting net figures. It sounded authentic. But as the unified deficit appeared less and less, the national debt continued to increase. While the unified deficit in 1997 was $21.9 billion, the actual deficit was $187.8 billion. In 1998 the unified budget reported a surplus of $70 billion, but actually there was a deficit of $109 billion. In 1999 the ``unified surplus'' was $124 billion, but the actual deficit was $127.8 billion. 
   Now comes the Presidential campaign. Social Security is a hot topic. Both parties are shouting: Save Social Security. Social Security lockbox. The economy is humming, booming. With high employment, the Social Security revenues have increased. It appears that, separate from Social Security, there will be enough trust fund money to compute a surplus. We have reached the millennium--Utopia--enough money to report a surplus without spending Social Security. 
   Washington jargon now changes. Instead of a ``unified budget,'' the Government now reports an ``on-budget'' and an ``off-budget.'' This is so we can all call it an on-budget surplus, meaning without Social Security. But to call it an on-budget surplus, the Government spends $96 billion from the other trust funds. 
   We ended last year with a deficit of $128 billion--not a surplus. The President's budget just submitted shows an actual deficit each year for the next 5 years. Instead of paying down the debt, the President shows, on page 420 of his budget, the debt increasing from the  year 2000 to the year 2013--$5.686 trillion to $6.815 trillion, an increase of $1.129 trillion. 
   They are all talking about paying off the debt by 2013, and the actual document they submit shows the debt increasing each year, and over that period an increase of over $1 trillion. 
   Each year, Congress spends more than the President's budgets. There is no chance of a surplus with both sides proposing to reduce revenues with a tax cut. But we have a sweetheart deal: The Republicans will call a deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote with tax cuts; the Democrats will call the deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote with increased spending. The worst abuse of campaign finance is using the Federal budget to buy votes. 
   Alan Greenspan could stop this. He could call a deficit a deficit. Instead, appearing before Congress in his confirmation hearing, Greenspan, talking of the Federal budget, stated: ``I would fear very much that these huge surpluses......'' and on and on. We are in real trouble when Greenspan calls huge deficits ``huge surpluses.'' Greenspan thinks his sole role is to protect the financial markets. He does not want the U.S. Government coming into the market borrowing billions to pay its deficit, crowding out private capital, and running up interest costs. 
   But Congress' job is to not only protect the financial markets 
   but the overall economy. Our job, as the board of directors for the Federal Government, is to make sure the Government pays its bills. In short, our responsibility is to eliminate waste. 
   The biggest waste of all is to continue to run up the debt with devastating interest costs for nothing. In good times, the least we can do is put this Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. Greenspan's limp admonition to ``pay down the debt'' is just to cover his backside. He knows better. He should issue a clarion call to stop increasing the debt. While he is raising interest rates to cool the economy, he should categorically oppose tax cuts to stimulate it. 
   Our only hope is the free press. In the earliest days, Thomas Jefferson observed, given a choice between a free government and a free press, he would choose the latter. Jefferson believed strongly that with the press reporting the truth to the American people, the Government would stay free. 
   Our problem is that the press and media have joined the conspiracy to defraud. They complain lamely that the Federal budget process is too complicated, so they report ``surplus.'' Complicated it is. But as to being a deficit or a surplus is clear cut; it is not complicated at all. All you need to do is go to the Department of the Treasury's report on public debt. They report the growth in the national debt every day, every minute, on the Internet at ``www.publicdebt.treas.gov.'' 
   In fact, there is a big illuminated billboard on Sixth Avenue in New York that reports the increase in the debt by the minute. At present, it shows that we are increasing the debt every minute by $894,000. Think of that--$894,000 a minute. Of course, increase the debt, and interest costs rise. Already, interest costs exceed the defense budget. Interest costs, like taxes, must be paid. Worse, while regular taxes support defense, and other programs, interest taxes support waste. Running a deficit of over $100 billion today, any tax cut amounts to an interest tax increase--an increase in waste. 
   If the American people realized what was going on, they would run us all out of town. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my friend William J. ``Red'' Wood who, since 1948, has been making Sullivan's Island, SC a better place to live and work. He came to the island, married, bought a home and raised six children, all the while giving back to a community that he deeply loves. 
   Red Wood's decades of service to Sullivan's Island make him one of the town's most valuable resources. It is only fitting that the Moultrie News recently recognized his achievements. Red has never hesitated to get involved. He joined the volunteer fire department during his early years on the island and helped to organize the Island Club, which sponsored the local Boy Scout troop. Red also helped start the island's Little League program and served on the township's recreation committee. 
   He has served on the town council for five terms and, during his first term, held the building inspector's post. In that capacity, he worked on several significant projects including East Cooper Hospital and the first hotel built in Mount Pleasant, SC. He believes his greatest civic achievement, however, is having a hand in incorporating Sullivan's Island. 
   Red worked for over 30 years in the engineering department of the Charleston Naval Shipyard and has devoted his time to numerous commitments on Sullivan's Island, his wife Monica and their children. 
   My wife, Peatsy, and I salute all of Red's accomplishments and his continuing service to Sullivan's Island. We wish him many peaceful days of fishing and shrimping. He certainly deserves them.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the World Trade Conference in Seattle was violence run amok. But it was a good reminder of the trauma that brought about our nation's high standard of living. Labor rights were obtained only after the murder of workers at Hay Market Square in Chicago. Environmental protection was obtained only after poisoned deaths at Love Canal. Safety laws were obtained only after poisoned food, poisoned drugs, and babies burned in their cribs. It took the trauma of class actions to make America aware of tobacco's injury, and it took President Teddy Roosevelt to hem in the robber barons with antitrust laws. The excesses of the free market--of free trade--can only be controlled by government. The peaceful demonstrators in Seattle were demonstrating against government's failure to control. 
   The threat of ``free trade'' was America's first lesson. The fledgling colony had just won its freedom when the mother country counselled ``free trade''. It was Riccardo's famous doctrine of ``comparative advantage''. Britain would trade with us what it produced best--the United States would trade back what it produced best. Alexander Hamilton, in his famous booklet ``Reports on Manufacturers,'' told the Brits to ``bug off.'' ``We are not going to remain your colony, exporting our timber, iron, and agriculture--and importing the finished products from England.'' The second bill (the first was for the U.S. Seal) to pass the national Congress on July 4, 1789 was ``protectionist''--a tariff bill of 50 percent over sixty-some articles. Later, when it was suggested that we import the steel for the transcontinental railroad, Abraham Lincoln said, ``No'', and a high tariff was imposed on steel. In the Depression, Roosevelt saved the family farm with subsidies and protective quotas. And it  was President Eisenhower who placed quotas on oil. World War II was won in the main by the United States' industrial and agricultural might--might built with protectionism. 
   After World War II the United States had the world's only industry. The task was to build a free market--to defeat communism with capitalism. The government--not the free market--instituted the Marshall Plan; sent money, equipment and expertise abroad for Europe and the Pacific Rim to rebuild. Today, our problem is that the Marshall Plan worked. The vanquished of World War II have become victors in production, in market share, in the global competition. Today, Japan produces more than the United States--and has the largest balance of trade; the United States the largest deficit in trade. We have tried and tried to open markets by setting the example, pleading ``free trade,'' giving away market share, giving away our technology, giving away our production. But nations, like the United States in the early days, are determined to build their industrial strength, and today controlled capitalism governs trade. Technology is obtained; market share is seized; production is transferred with controlled capitalism. Trade is not free, not controlled. 
   The fall of the Wall has presented us with a new threat. Four billion workers have been liberated from communism and oppression. They are ready to work regardless of pay, safety or the environment. It's a given in manufacture that labor costs represent 30 percent of volume and you can save as much as 20 percent of volume by moving your production to a low wage country. Technology now can be transferred on a computer chip to any place in the world--and finance it by satellite. A corporation with $500 million in sales can retain its executive office and sales force in-country, but move its production to a low wage country and make $100 million before taxes. Or it can continue to work its own employees and go bankrupt. The rush is for production offshore--downsize onshore--and keep crying ``free trade.'' 
   These corporations and our competitors have been spoiled. At all the trade conferences they have come to expect the Special Trade Representative to arrive bearing gifts. They know the United States doesn't enforce its trade laws. They know the President and the Congress are controlled by corporate money. They have come to expect the United States to come crying ``fair trade'', but giving away the store. President Clinton's invitation to Seattle was like an invite to a birthday party. But rather than bearing gifts, the demonstrators caused the President to call for labor rights and environmental 
    protection. The competition was so spoiled they took the United States' position at Seattle as an invasion of their sovereignty. 
   The security of the United States is like a three legged stool. The one leg of the Nation's values is admired the world around. The second leg of military power is unquestioned. But the third leg of economic strength has been fractured. For 50 years we have been losing production, technology and market share. Today, this threatens a loss of the middle class, the weakening of our democracy--the loss of our security as a nation. When Henry Ford started the assembly line he wanted to be sure that his workers could make enough to buy the car they were producing. thus began the strong middle class in America. The labor movement brought health care and other benefits so that the worker could buy a home, pay for health care, send their kids to college and afford a vacation trip. The WTO puts this social contract in jeopardy. It's one-size-fits-all capitalism only dumbs down America's standard of living. 
   For years the United States has had and continues to have the most productive industrial worker in the world. But we have less and less of them each year. The cold war policy of free trade sacrificed our electronics, textiles, shoes, steel, hand tools, shipbuilding, etc. Jack Welch of General Electric has just instituted an affirmative action plan to export GE's jobs to Mexico. Now, with NAFTA, the rest of our manufacturing is headed South. Worse, the internet doesn't provide enough jobs to build a nation--and it doesn't export. Microsoft, rated the No. 1 industry in America, has only 22,000 jobs in the United States compared to General Motors with 250,000. As Akio Morita cautioned years ago, ``That world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.'' The United States becomes weaker each day. 
   The time has come to break with the failed trade policies of the past and instead pursue a policy that zealously promotes the national interest while at the same time remains true to our core values of promoting both economic growth and social justice. This will only be accomplished by recognizing that the WTO system is a relic of a bygone era. The WTO system was an instrument of the cold war. It served as an adjunct in the much larger strategic struggle between East and West. It required the U.S. to sustain concessions necessary to maintain the cohesion of the Western alliance. For all the talk about opening markets, WTO and its predecessor, the GATT, have proven to be abysmal failures. In 1979, Ambassador Robert Strauss proclaimed that the Tokyo round will open new markets for U.S. companies, yet from the Tokyo round to the Uruguay round, the U.S. racked up over a trillion dollars worth of trade deficits. In 1994, President Clinton proclaimed that the Uruguay round would crack open markets. Since that time the U.S. continued with record trade deficits and last year recorded its first $300 billion deficit. In each successive round, the U.S. agreed to asymmetrical market opening commitments. Each time we concluded a round, the trade deficit widened. Perhaps the WTO system's biggest failure is its claim that it is raising living standards. The argument made in Seattle was that market forces alone would raise living standards--an argument we rejected in our own country at the turn of the century. 
   The reality is that unfettered free trade has unleashed a race to the bottom as nations in the developing world engage in a vicious competition to attract foreign investment. For example, in his book ``One World Ready or Not, Bill Greider vividly describes this race to the bottom, ``The toy industry--much like textiles and garments, shoes, electronics assembly and other low-wage sectors--existed (and thrived) by exploiting a crude ladder of desperate competition among the poorest nations. Its factories regularly hopped to new locations where wages were even lower, where the governments would be even more tolerant of abusive practices.'' 
   We must rebuild. Get real! No more of this ``setting the example.'' No more crying, ``free trade,'' ``fair trade,'' ``level the playing field.'' No more of this harassing others to be like us. Our job is to compete; to protect labor, protect our environment, protect our production--to protect the United States' standard of living. The free market won't do this. Only government will. Protection is the fundamental of government. We have the Army to protect us from without, the FBI to protect us from 
   within. We have Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old age, Medicare and Medicaid to protect us from ill health. We have EPA to protect the environment, FDA to protect our food and drugs, the FCC to protect communications, the FAA to protect air travel, the Consumer Protection Agency to provide safe products, and the Federal Trade Commission to protect us from the restraint of trade. Don't be misled by the cry of ``globalization.'' This is the chant of our corporate fifth column. Silicon Valley is not the answer. This is the crowd that government gave the Internet; that government trained at Illinois and Stanford; that government subsidized with sematech; and now the billionaires all want to eliminate the estate tax, eliminate capital gains, eliminate state tort laws, eliminate the immigration laws, eliminate taxes on the Internet, eliminate the antitrust laws--just eliminate the government. Let's stop running against government. We are the government. Our task is to make government work. Our responsibility, is to keep America strong. 
   We must organize to do battle. The first order of business is to eliminate the Special Trade Representative who looks to desert and represent some country against us. Next, merge and downsize the 28 departments and agencies that now deal with trade into a Department of Trade and Commerce.  Then organize Congress' handling of trade issues. Our competition presents a solid front. Any trade measure to protect America's jobs is immediately opposed by Japan's 100 consultants and law firms, by America's big banks, the Trilateral Commission, the Business Roundtable, the National Manufacturers Association, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the consultants and campuses financed by corporate America, the retailers, the newspaper editorialists financed by the retailers, the business lobbyists, and most of the 60,000 lawyers in Washington. Trade bills today are passed in Congress by multinational corporations joining with the foreigners and, thereupon, the President garners the votes with local pork. The common good is ignored. 
   Once organized, we must repeal the tax laws that subsidize the export of American jobs. Then abolish the International Trade Commission that habitually cancels the findings of injury by the International Trade Administration. Remove the Executive veto of trade findings so that an industry fighting for relief can count on it when upheld by the courts. In short, enforce our trade laws now on the books. This will stabilize domestic production. This will restore trust in government. 
   The symbol of the Seattle ministerial was not the black hooded hoodlums intent on causing mayhem. Instead, they were Boeing machinists who led the large labor marches that snaked through the streets of Seattle. Boeing, an export powerhouse, was supposed to stand out as a shining example of the open trading system. But Boeing is experiencing the loss of jobs to government-financed Airbus; to China where the price of admission into the Chinese market is an agreement to shift production from the United States to factories in mainland China. The machinists did not join the mayhem. They trust the government to act in their interest--to act in the United States' interest. For this to happen, as Lincoln said, ``The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. As you know, I initially objected to the movement of this legislation because of my concerns about the manner in which it preempted state law. As introduced, this bill would have nullified any ability of state legislatures to adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, (UETA), in a manner that varied from the provisions of the bill, or in a manner that reserved the right of states to adopt UETA in conformance with their consumer protection laws. When the bill was reported by the Commerce Committee, provisions were included to provide states this flexibility. Since the reporting of the bill, the preemption language has been amended to provide that to avoid adherence to the federal law, a state must adopt UETA ``in the form, or any substantially similar variation'' as provided to the states by the National Conference on Uniform State Law. 
   Do you agree that notwithstanding this change, the purpose and intent of the preemption provisions, either pursuant to the definitions in the bill or otherwise, have not changed? And that the legislation, in its current form, is intended to permit states the flexibility of adopting and enacting UETA in a manner and form that ensures its conformance with state consumer protection laws?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to address another change to the bill since its reporting by the Committee. As you know, the legislation has been amended to incorporate language providing that the bill applies to the business of insurance. This language has the effect of permitting the validation of insurance contracts pursuant to electronic commerce. As you know, state insurance commissioners have expressed reservations about this provision. There is concern that the provision could potentially adversely affect the ability of states to maintain their full regulatory authority over these transactions. Do you agree that insurance companies that enter into agreements via electronic commerce are still required to meet all other state insurance regulatory requirements?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this conference report represents a first step in promoting satellite as a competitor to cable. The conference was presented with two bills which approached a number of the major issues in very different ways. In order to reach an agreement, compromises were made. As a result, I believe consumers are better off with the passage of this bill, and satellite companies are now in a better position to compete with cable companies. 
   A number of provisions in particular will improve and expand satellite service to consumers. This conference report establishes a framework for satellite companies to deliver local network signals into local markets. This allows satellite consumers to receive their local network stations by satellite. The satellite companies have indicated that it is crucial that they are able to deliver local broadcast signals to satellite consumers if they are to compete with cable. I hope going forward, satellite companies embrace this provision and provide local signals to as many markets as possible, including those in rural areas. 
   In addition to these provisions, the conference report directs the FCC to establish a waiver process to allow satellite consumers who cannot receive their broadcast signals over an outdoor antenna, to obtain a waiver and be allowed to get distant network signals. This provision establishes a uniform waiver process and ensures that a consumer's request for a waiver will be addressed within 30 days. The conference report also requires the FCC to improve the accuracy of the methodology used to predict which consumers cannot receive their broadcast signals over the air, and therefore, can obtain distant network signals by satellite. Language also has been placed in the bill to improve the negotiating position of the satellite companies in their negotiations with broadcasters to obtain programming. Hopefully, this provision  will help satellite providers to obtain programming from broadcasters on fair and reasonable terms, and ultimately, provide consumers with service at a competitive price. 
   As noted previously, compromises were made. As the bill advanced through committee, I opposed the grandfathering of satellite customers who had been illegally provided distant network signals. At that time, I stated that illegal activities should not be rewarded. Satellite companies should not benefit from a grandfather of illegally provided distant broadcast signals to consumers. Nonetheless, the conference decided to allow satellite consumers who can receive their local network signals of Grade B intensity over an antenna, to continue to receive distant network signals by satellite. It also allowed satellite consumers who receive distant broadcast signals through big (C-band) dishes to continue receiving such service regardless of whether their distant broadcast signals have been cut-off or have been scheduled to be cut-off. In this bill, we have taken a number of steps to provide a better framework for the provision of satellite service. Therefore, I hope satellite companies will comply with the law going forward. 
   I expect the passage of this conference report will result in the delivery of better satellite service to consumers, and ensure that satellite companies can provide consumers with a competitively priced option to cable service.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with both pride and sadness as we say goodbye to a long time member of my staff, Ivan Schlager. I have known Ivan for nearly 20 years. One cold afternoon at Northwestern University in 1983, Ivan approached a woman, he thought to be a staffer on the Hollings for President Campaign and offered to volunteer on that effort. 
   That ``staffer'' turned out to my wife, Peatsy Hollings, and before Ivan knew what had happened, he was driving and wading through the snow of New Hampshire in support of my effort. 
   After finishing at Northwestern and law school at Georgetown, Ivan joined the Commerce Committee staff in 1989 and began to assist both Senator ROCKEFELLER and myself at the Subcommittee on Tourism and Foreign Commerce. In this job, he played an important role on many of the international trade agreements concluded over the past decade, including most notably the Uruguay Round agreement which created the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   I truly believe that Ivan is one of the most knowledgeable and substantive individuals with regard to international trade. He was instrumental in insuring that all voices were heard during these important debates. 
   More than 3 years ago, Ivan became the Commerce Committee's staff director and he has overseen its operations since that time. He has provided the committee Democrats with a thoughtful and pragmatic approach to a remarkable variety of issues. Moreover, he has developed a fine working relationship with Chairman MCCAIN, his  staff and the remainder of the Republicans on the committee. 
   On many occasions, these relationships have assisted in forging a bipartisan consensus on a variety of issues that have helped advance good public policy in areas such as telecommunications and broadcast policy, aviation, trucking and rail issues, technology development and environmental and oceans concerns. 
   One particular issue stands out, last year's tobacco debate. Under difficult personal circumstances, Ivan worked closely with both Republicans and Democrats to help craft a compromise that was reported out of the committee by a 19-1 vote. 
   On other occasions, such as product liability or international trade we have been unable to reach bipartisan consensus and have been forced to hash out our differences on the Senate floor. In those instances, I have been blessed to have Ivan's energy, quick thinking, political intuition and wise counsel during the debate. 
   As, I mentioned earlier, I first met Ivan when he was in his early twenties. Both Peatsy and I have seen him grow from a college student to a dedicated and accomplished public servant. We rejoiced when he met and married his lovely wife, Martha Verrill. We celebrated when they had a baby boy, Ethan, and then a second, William. We grieved with him when his father passed away last year. And today we wish him well as he moves onto his next step in joining the internationally recognized law firm of Skadden, Arps. 
   Ivan, thank you for all that you have done for Peatsy and me, the Commerce Committee, and for our country. We will miss you.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3419 the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. This bill creates a separate modal administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, to administer the commercial motor vehicle safety laws and make needed improvements to our highway safety programs. To secure enactment of this important legislation, Senator MCCAIN and I worked with our colleagues in the House to craft a compromise bill. I would like to commend Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Democrat OBERSTAR of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their efforts on this compromise proposal. The Administration supports this legislation and the Secretary of Transportation has requested that the Senate complete consideration of this legislation prior to the adjournment of the first session of the 106th Congress. 
   As many of you may know, I introduced legislation in the 1980s to establish a separate modal administration within the Department of Transportation for the motor carrier industry. Since safety oversight was moved from the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1966, truck and bus safety oversight has been a part of the Federal Highway Administration. H.R. 3419 continues the bifurcation of motor carrier economic and safety regulation. The economic regulatory authority will still be vested at the Surface Transportation Board, and the safety regulatory authority will be designated to the new Administration. Under the current regulatory structure there is a separate regulatory agency for rail, transit, air, and maritime transportation, but no primary agency for the largest mode of commercial transportation--the trucking industry. Establishing a separate agency with the stated responsibility for making the highways safer would be an important step forward in highlighting the importance of truck and bus safety as well as improving regulatory efficiency. I am pleased that members of the Senate and House have agreed to establish a new modal administration; we have high expectations this change will lead to tougher standards, more expeditious rule makings, and a greater degree of enforcement than has been the norm in recent years. 
   The trucking industry generates over 80% of the revenues derived from the domestic transportation of cargo. The industry has undergone fantastic growth in the past five years. 
   The number of carriers operating in the trucking industry has close to doubled since 1994 alone. Overall, the volume of truck traffic on the highways in this country is astounding, and clearly has an impact on safety. As many of you know, I was not a supporter of deregulating the trucking industry, and I question whether this policy has contributed to our present safety concerns. 
   The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee has held several hearings on the subject of motor carrier safety in the last year. These hearings have included testimony from a number of organizations, including the Department of Transportation's Inspector General, the Chairman of the National Transportation Board and consumer groups all expressing concern about the Office of Motor  Carriers and stating the need for reform. Chairman MCCAIN and I have worked to incorporate many of the recommendations by these groups into the legislation we are considering today. 
   I would like to briefly summarize some of the major provisions and important consequences of H.R. 3419. This legislation undoubtedly will increase the overall number of safety inspections by requiring that all new entrants to the truck and bus industry undergo a safety review. The bill also requires that carriers become familiar with motor carrier safety regulations and undergo a safety review in order to obtain operating authority. Currently 25,000 to 40,000 new carriers enter into interstate commerce annually. In order to obtain operating authority under the present system, new operators must show proof of insurance and sign a form attesting that they are familiar with safety regulations. This new provision would require that new carriers be designated as ``new entrants'' until the completion of a successful safety review. The intent of this provision is to make sure that new operators have basic safety management practices in place. During their first eighteen months of operation, they would need to show that they have critical safety elements in place--for example, drug testing, maintenance plans, and driving records such as logbooks. This safety review is not intended to be a time consuming investigation of the property and drivers, nor is it intended to be a barrier to entry for new operators; in fact we have stipulated that the Secretary should take into consideration the needs of small businesses when conducting the rulemaking on new entrant safety reviews. However, there is broad consensus that an entry level safety review to ensure a minimum level of safety and compliance with federal safety regulations. 
   I am pleased that this bill increases the number of motor carrier safety inspectors by requiring that DOT certify private contractors to perform safety audits. I would also like to commend Senator BREAUX for his leadership on the issue of third party inspectors. His introduction of S. 1524, the Motor Carrier Safety Specialist Certification Act, following the Mother's Day bus accident in New Orleans was instrumental in demonstrating the need for additional qualified inspectors. These third party auditors will be required to conduct the initial safety reviews of the new carriers and are likely to lead to an increasing number of inspections and audits overall. These auditors will be certified by DOT to perform safety audits and inspections, however DOT will retain the authority to grant operating authority and issue ratings--we have no plans to delegate this vital enforcement authority to the private sector. The Secretary is directed to complete a rulemaking to establish how third party 
   inspectors are to be certified. However, our expectation is that their role is to assist with the collection of data, not supersede the existing authority of the DOT. 
   This legislation authorizes an additional $140 million a year for motor carrier safety and data improvements over the levels established in TEA-21, the federal safety transportation bill that was passed in the last year. Of that money $65 million is guaranteed under the budgetary firewalls established in TEA-21. The bulk of this funding will go directly to the states through the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP). This grant program to the states is the underpinning for the enforcement of commercial motor vehicle safety laws and I am pleased that we are more than doubling the funding authorized for this important safety program. I look forward to working the Department Transportation to ensure this new agency will have adequate personnel to achieve the important safety objectives set forth in this bill. 
   H.R. 3419 also requires many data improvements, including periodic refilling of motor carrier information, which means that safety statistics on trucks and buses are soon to be more up to date and that improvement data will be available to the public. Currently, only twenty percent of the carriers operating in interstate commerce have been inspected or audited in relation to safety ratings by the Department of Transportation--this number is insufficient. In order to increase the number of safety rated carriers, accurate data is required. H.R. 3419 directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in cooperation with the new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, to carry out a program to improve the collection and analysis of data on commercial motor vehicle crashes, including crash causation and requires NHTSA to integrate driver citation and conviction information. In addition, the Secretary is directed to conduct a crash causation study to determine the causes of, and contributing factors to, crashes involving commercial motor vehicles--all interested parties, including victims and safety groups, should be consulted in designing the study. The legislation also requires the Department of Transportation to disclose potential conflicts of interest, and requires DOT to study whether disclosure obligations are sufficient to avoid conflicts of interest. Proper safety regulation is dependent on thorough and impartial research. 
   H.R. 3419 also toughens Commercial Drives License (CDL) requirements. It will require that medical qualification certificates be part of all CDLs. It will prohibit the masking of convictions on CDL's, thereby ending the practice of erasing convictions for increased fines and plea bargaining down convictions, and erasing convictions in exchange for attending bypass or educational programs. The legislation also will provide access to driver records for safety enforcement and hiring purposes--driver records would be made available to employees, current employers, future employers and law enforcement personnel on request. This language will address concerns about inacurate driver records and ensure that the practice of masking convictions or records is ended. This provision lists parties which should have access to the driving records of commercial motor vehicle operators, however, the expection is that parties such as insurers which currently have access to this information will continue to do so. 
   I am pleased that this legislation now includes a separate school bus CDL endorsement. By requiring the Secretary to establish a rule making for a CDL endorsement, which includes at a minimum, a driving skills test in a school bus, as well as safety procedures for loading and unloading, using emergency exits and traversing highway rail grade crossings, this bill places a greater emphasis on the safety of transporting our children. 
   H.R. 3419 also includes recommendations from the DOT IG's report. These recommendations call for the strengthening of enforcement policy by increasing fines, requiring greater monitoring of carriers and standardizing data. The IG's report clearly indicates that we need to do more in the way of compliance reviews and clearing up the back-log of regulatory initiatives that have not been completed. These initiatives are overdue, and the public deserves an aggressive pro-active safety policy. 
   Several of the IG's recommendations address the enforcement of civil penalties to ensure greater compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial drivers' license laws. Section 222 of H.R. 3419 includes provisions establishing minimum, as well as maximum, penalties for violations. Because situations arise when the Secretary may choose to exercise discretion in the assessment of maximum penalties, a provision was included to allow assessment of penalties at a lower level than established by this provision in extraordinary circumstances. The goal of this provision is to provide administrative flexibility while ensuring that the previous abuses in motor carrier safety enforcement practices are not perpetuated by the new agency. In assessing penalties for violations, the Secretary's exercise of discretion under extraordinary circumstances to reduce or eliminate fines should only be used in rare and unusual conditions and this legislation requires that the Secretary document the justification for such a situation. In addition, the bill will require the Secretary of Transportation and the IG to periodically report to the Congress on their progress implementing not only the application of civil penalties but all of the IG's recommendations. 
   Additionally, the legislation addresses the issue concerning truck inspections at the US-Mexico border. Currently, far too few trucks are being inspected at the US-Mexico border and  far too few inspected trucks comply with U.S. safety standards. I should note that I do not support Mexican truckers operating in the United States, because this policy ultimately threatens public safety. For example, according to the DOT Inspector General, at the border crossing in El Paso, Texas, an average of 1,300 trucks enter daily, yet only one inspector is on duty allowing for only 10 to 14 truck inspections daily. At other crossings, there are no inspectors. Of those Mexican trucks inspected, about 44 percent were placed out of service because of serious safety violations. This contrasts with a 25 percent out-of-service rate for US trucks and 17 percent for Canadian trucks. This safety record is unacceptable. 
   The DOT's Inspector General confirmed last year that 68 Mexican trucks were found operating beyond the border commercial zones, where they are legally allowed to work and are probably involved in US cabotage reserved for US truckers. H.R. 3419 would reaffirm the prohibition on foreign motor carriers operating outside the boundaries of a commercial zone along the U.S.-Mexico border. Foreign trucks that are found to be operating outside the commercial zones without authority will be subject to civil penalties. 
   In conclusion, I would like to ask my colleagues for their support in the passage of this legislation. I would like to thank the following Senate staff for their work on this bill; Debbie Hersman, Carl Bentzel, Kevin Kayes and Moses Boyd, Ann Begeman, Charlotte Casey, and Mark Buese. I would also like to thank House staffers, Clyde Woodle, Dave Heymsfeld, Ward McCarragher, Jess Sharp, Chris Bertram, Patty Doersch, Jack Schenendorf and Roger Nober. These staffers all worked hard to help reach a bipartisan compromise. 
   H.R. 3419 is a good bill. I strongly support the passage of H.R. 3419 and look forward to its enactment.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, two core principles guide our economy, competition and the rule of law. In the absence of competition there is no innovation or consumer choice. For over 100 years the anti-trust laws have served as an indispensable bullwark to ensure that unfettered competition does not result in monopoly power that stifles innovation and denies consumers a choice. 
   So it is curious that a veritable who's who of ``conservative'' politicians and think tanks unleashed a barrage of faxes attacking Federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision in United States v. Microsoft. 
   Based on a voluminous record, Judge Jackson found that Microsoft had succeeded in ``stifling innovations that would benefit consumers, for the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.'' 
   The factual findings of the District Court held that ``Microsoft will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of its core products.'' 
   According to the District Court, Microsoft ``foreclosed an opportunity for PC makers to make Windows PC systems less confusing and more user-friendly as consumers desired.'' 
   The record included the testimony of numerous high tech entrepreneurs who felt the lash of Microsoft's monopolistic wrath. From IBM's inability to gain support for its OS2/Warp operating system to Apple's inability to effectively compete with Windows to threats to cut off Netscape's ``oxygen supply,'' Microsoft engaged in a pernicious pattern of anticompetitive behavior, openly flaunting the rule of law. Perhaps the most damning of all was the evasive testimony of Microsoft founder William Gates. 
   It is, frankly, a record that is quite embarrassing. But rather than show remorse, Microsoft has embarked on a vendetta to punish the outstanding group of Justice Department lawyers who bested its minions of high-payed lawyers and spin doctors. 
   So, Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to praise the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and its leader Joel Klein. It is well known that I had my doubts about Mr. Klein, but I am pleased to say, and not too proud to admit, that I misjudged him. He is doing an outstanding job. 
   In the long run, failure to promote competition and innovation will undermine our preeminence in the high tech arena.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my good friend, the Reverend Dr. George Elias Meetze, who was recently named Pastor Emeritus of Incarnation Lutheran Church in Columbia, South Carolina. 
   Dr. Meetze has been serving the South Carolina community for over sixty years. He led the congregation at  St. Barnabas Lutheran Church in Charleston, SC from 1934 to 1937, at Grace Lutheran Church in Prosperity, SC from 1937 to 1942 and at Incarnation Lutheran Church from 1942 to 1974. In addition, Dr. George Meetze has been the chaplain of the South Carolina Senate for fifty years. 
   His honors and affiliations are too numerous to list, but include leadership positions within the Lutheran Church and involvement with such organizations as the Salvation Army, The American Cancer Society, and The Rotary Club, which named him a Paul Harris Fellow in 1979. He is, as you would imagine, an active supporter of the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in Columbia, SC and Newberry College in Newberry, SC. A fixture in the Columbia, SC community and across the state of South Carolina, Dr. George Meetze knows many people, but is known by even more for his friendliness and genuine interest in every individual he meets. 
   My wife, Peatsy, and I, whom Dr. George Meetze joined in marriage twenty-eight years ago, commend Incarnation Lutheran Church for conferring the title of Pastor Emeritus on Dr. George Meetze and we send our warmest congratulations to George and his family on this happy occasion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Linda J. Morgan. Today we are considering the nomination of Linda Morgan to be reappointed as the chairman of the Surface Transportation Board. I am proud to say that I have known Chairman Morgan for many years. Although we may not always agree, I have a great deal of respect for her and know that two qualities she possesses in abundance are fairness and integrity. Those qualities, coupled with her commitment to public service, make her an outstanding chairman. 
   Before I discuss Chairman Morgan's abilities and accomplishments, I would like to comment briefly on the agreement reached between railroad management and labor this week on the cram down issue. As many of you know, the carriers and their employees have been working on the terms of an agreement which would create new rules pertaining to the abrogation of  collective bargaining agreements. Yesterday, the parties agreed to a moratorium on the filing of section 4 notices while the negotiations take place to establish new rules. I am pleased that the parties were able to reach a compromise on this important issue and urge the STB to look favorably on this agreement. In addition, I expect to address this issue legislatively next year when we take up the STB reauthorization bill. 
   As many of you know, Linda Morgan served as counsel for the Surface Transportation Subcommittee for 8 years and then as general counsel for the full Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for seven years. During that time I found Linda Morgan to be one of the most intelligent and thorough professionals that I have worked with. She is smart and she cares about the issues--I know that she is committed to serving the public in her capacity as the chairman of the Surface Transportation Board. 
   Linda Morgan has served as chairman of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) since it was created in 1996. Prior to that, she served as chairman of the ICC. In 1996 she was responsible for implementing the changes that Congress envisioned in the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act. She pared down the ICC and established a new, more streamlined agency in its place, the STB. 
   Chairman Morgan is to be commended for her achievements and commitment to the mission of the STB during her first term. The STB operates with only 135 people, less than half the staff of it predecessor, but it is charged with regulating the entire railroad industry. Among her accomplishments, Chairman Morgan has facilitated creating a more efficient process for resolving rate disputes between shippers and carriers. Additionally, under her leadership, she has helped the private sector come to agreements on short line access and agricultural services arbitration which have benefited the entire transportation industry. 
   Chairman Morgan has done an outstanding job moving the agency through several different places. She successfully transitioned the agency from the ICC to the STB. She has seen the railroad industry through three very large merger transactions. She helped resolve the service issues in the west. And last year she ended the practice of using product and geographic competition in determining appropriate rates for shippers. 
   Linda Morgan has done a lot of heavy lifting during her tenure as chairman of the STB. She has my full confidence and I support her nomination.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator BREAUX, in introducing the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Conservation Act of 1999. I am pleased to co-sponsor this legislative effort to promote conservation and bycatch reduction of small swordfish, billfish, and other highly migratory species. 
   The Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Conservation Act would create time-area closures for pelagic longline fishing along 160,000 miles of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico coasts. These closures include the three major spawning areas where a significant portion of juvenile swordfish and billfish bycatch mortality occurs. I am particularly pleased to see that these closures encompass the coastal waters of my home state of South Carolina and particularly a highly productive swordfish spawning and nursery ground, the Charleston Bump. In conjunction with the closures, the bill would reduce fishing capacity by retiring approximately 68 longline vessels from the commercial fishery through a fair and equitable program funded by the federal government and the recreational and commercial fishing industries. In addition, the Act would establish a research program, in conjunction with the National Marine Fisheries Service, to study longline gear and potential gear improvements. All too frequently we are forced to make fisheries management decisions with too little information; these research provisions will provide data crucial for management of highly migratory species. 
   The current proposal results from arduous work and negotiation among commercial and recreational fishing groups including the Coastal Conservation Association, the American Sportsfishing Association, the Billfish Foundation, and the Blue Water Fisherman's Association. I commend these groups for their cooperation in developing this truly constructive conservation plan based on extensive analyses of the best available science. I also approve of their effort to make this bill consistent with the principles governing capacity reduction established in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. 
   The introduction of the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Conservation Act of 1999 couldn't come at a better time. Many of the highly migratory  species, including North Atlantic swordfish, are currently overfished. The National Marine Fisheries Service reports that billfish and some shark and tuna species are at all-time lows in abundance as a result of longline fishing bycatch and widespread disregard for international rules by commercial fishermen of other nations. The international management body for highly migratory species, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), recently expressed concern about the high catches and discards of small swordfish and emphasized that future gains in yield could accrue if fishing mortality on small fish could be reduced. Further, ICCAT encouraged member nations to consider alternative methods such as time/area closures to aid rebuilding of highly migratory stocks. I commend Senator BREAUX for attempting to establish such areas domestically, and hope that we can serve as a model for other nations. 
   While this legislation can result in important conservation achievements, we must also employ other means to protect and rebuild our highly migratory species such as swordfish. Next week, ICCAT will convene in Rio de Janero, Brazil to determine new international management measures for Atlantic swordfish. The United States must supplement Senator BREAUX's proposal by securing an agreement at ICCAT that will reduce catches by all member nations sufficient to allow the North Atlantic swordfish population to recover within ten years or less--a goal that scientists tell us can only be achieved if we count discarded dead swordfish against the catch quotas. In addition, I am certain that Senator BREAUX's effort to reduce bycatch and establish time-area closures will serve as a powerful example to the international community of a responsible method for sustaining and restoring highly migratory species. 
   I applaud my colleague and the other architects of this ambitious conservation effort and look forward to working with Senator BREAUX and other cosponsors to ensure that this legislation is part of an effective national plan that ensures recovery of the North Atlantic swordfish stock within 10 years in a manner consistent with the goals of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. I rise today to pay tribute to Richard P. Augulis on the occasion of his retirement as director of the National Weather Service Central Region. 
   In Mr. Augulis' 35 years with the National Weather Service, including 13 years as director of the 14-state Central Region, he has held public safety paramount, whether as a forecaster or as a manager. He has now retired to Las Vegas, Nevada where he is able to enjoy this new venture with members of his family.  
   Mr. Augulis joined the National Weather Service in August 1961 as a Weather Bureau Student Trainee at WBAS Midway Airport while attending St. Louis University. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology in 1963 and added a Masters Degree in 1967. He distinguished himself in a variety of forecasting and management positions--in Salt Lake City; Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska; Garden City, New York; and, finally, Kansas City. 
   Beginning in 1974, as Meteorologist in Charge of the new Fairbanks Weather Forecast Office, Mr. Augulis presided over a staff that operated service programs during the exciting and challenging times of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline construction. Mr. Augulis' leadership was also invaluable to employees during the mid-1970s when the National Weather Service implemented the Automation of Field Operations (AFOS) communications network, making a breakthrough transition from teletype to computers. 
   Mr. Augulis' last decade with the National Weather Service included the largest modernization and reorganization ever undertaken by the agency. He helped guide his region through the introduction and implementation of state-of-the-art Doppler radar, computer-enhanced weather modeling and forecasting, and restructuring from more than 300 offices of varying sizes and capabilities to an efficient network of 123 21st Century Weather Forecast Offices across the United States. 
   Mr. Augulis has served proudly as an employee and a manager of the National Weather Service. He is a distinguished executive branch employee whose accomplishments reflect credit on himself, the National Weather Service and our nation. 
   On this occasion, I am honored to join his family, friends and colleagues as we recognize Richard P. Augulis on his retirement from the National Weather Service.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished managers of the bill offered the $8 billion figure in sales and some 121,000 jobs. The truth is, we know from the Labor Department statistics that we have lost 420,000 textile jobs nationwide and some 31,200 textile jobs in South Carolina alone. They said NAFTA was going to create 200,000 jobs. They claim today it is 121,000. In Mexico itself, it was going to create 200,000 jobs. We know textiles alone lost 420,000, and it is undisputed that 31,200 jobs were lost in the State of South Carolina. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print two articles with respect to the economy and how it has worked in Mexico, one from the Wall Street Journal and the other from the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the reason I included these articles is because my distinguished mentor, the senior Senator from New York, voted with me on NAFTA and that is against NAFTA. We had misgivings. Of course, the proof is in the Wall Street Journal and the American Chamber of Commerce articles about how they are making less down there 4 to 5 years since the enactment of NAFTA. We were told it was going to create a positive balance of trade. We had a $5 billion-plus balance of trade at the time of enactment. Now we have a $17 billion deficit in the balance of trade with Mexico since NAFTA. 
   We were told it was going to solve the immigration problem. It has worsened. We were told it was going to solve the drug problem. It has worsened. As I said before, there is no education in the second kick of a mule. We have been through this exercise about how we are all going to put our arms together and hug and love and help our neighbors. Fine with me if it really would work that way. It has not worked that way and is not about to work that way in sub-Sahara and the Caribbean. I will get into those items in just a few minutes. 
   With respect to the morning article--I try to get into the Wall Street Journal because a lot of my crowd in South Carolina reads it. They have me as the old isolationist: Hollings: ``Info revolution escapes him.'' 
   Really? I know a good bit more about the information revolution than the Wall Street Journal does. I helped bring a good bit of it to South Carolina, in fact, with my technical training for skills. I was in Dublin, Ireland, and walked into the most modern microprocessing plants of Intel outside of Dublin. My friend, Frank McKay, was there. He said: Governor, I want to show you your technical training program. We sent two teams to Midlands Tech in Columbia, SC, and we reproduced what was there, and that is how I got it up and going and operating and in the black. 
   I told this to Andy Grove when he came by, and he thanked me again. I know a little bit about the information revolution. I am all for it. My problem is, on the one hand, it does not create the jobs they all advertise. 
   The Wall Street Journal ran an article about Wal-Mart and General Motors. Wal-Mart exceeded the number of employees of General Motors for the first time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want the Wall Street Journal to read its own articles. 
   The leading line:  
   For decades, the U.S. has been evolving from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. But Labor Day 1997 marks a milestone: Earlier this year, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the discount retailer, passed General Motors Corporation as the nation's largest private employer.  
   General Motors' average hourly wage is about $19 an hour; including benefits, it is $44 an hour. Whereas at Wal-Mart stores, the average hourly wage is $7.50; including benefits, $10. In manufacturing, the salary is four times that in the service economy. That is why they are all talking about this wonderful economic boom that has to do with the service economy, so much so that the labor unions I see have buddied up with the American Chamber of Commerce. The American Chamber of Commerce has gone international. They are not representing Main Street America.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, ``Mr. Sweeney's decision to back the Clinton trade agenda rankled the more militant unions, such as the Teamsters, and the United Steelworkers of America.'' Those are the manufacturing jobs. Just as the fabric boys divorced themselves from apparel and now can toot for this kind of legislation, the head of the service economy, John Sweeney, has forgotten about manufacturing jobs, and he is going along. That is why we got this overwhelmingly bipartisan majority. 
   But back to the point, this is what disturbs this particular Senator, that we are hollowing out the manufacturing strength, the industrial backbone of the United States of America.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from the article:  
   ..... they estimate the computing and communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of the GDP --up from 2.8% in 1990....... 
   The value added of Internet sales--i.e., its contribution to the gross domestic product--would be much less, probably little more than 1% of the gross domestic product.  
   Mr. President, another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on information technology has risen from 10 percent of a firm's total capital, equipment and investment in 1980 to 60 percent today. Again, this is based on constant dollar figures. And it hugely exaggerates the true increase.  
   In terms of current dollars.......Goldman Sachs calculate that business investments in computers accounts for 35% of total capital spending, not 60%. And even this exaggerates the importance of [information technology] because much of the money goes to replace equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly. The share of [information technology] in additional ``net'' investment is much smaller. Computers still account for only 2% of America's total net capital stock.  
   I want to dwell on this for a moment, for the main and simple reason that this really is what is at issue and why the Senator from South Carolina takes the floor. It is just not textiles. Textiles is on its way out. 
   And by another headline I saw in the New York Times, on the right-hand upper column of the front page this morning, President Clinton is getting together with the People's Republic of China to admit them to the World Trade Organization. You can pass the CBI, the sub-Sahara, the NAFTA there, there, and there yonder, and pull it all around, but once that is done, once China gets into the World Trade Organization and starts with its transshipments and its appeals, it controls the general assembly. 
   We had a resolution about 4 years ago to have hearings on human rights within the People's Republic of China. That crowd went back down into Africa and Australia and around and changed the vote, and they never had the hearing. 
   So I am telling you, we really are going to be a minority in the World Trade Organization. They can change around your environmental protections, your labor protections, your high standard of living, and everything else. And the CBI and sub-Sahara, and everything else that we think we are doing something to help, we are going to China, I can tell you that right now with the front page article about President Clinton. So we know where we are headed with respect to that. 
   But my friend, Eamonn Fingleton, has written a book, ``In Praise of Hard Industries.'' Obviously, I can't include the book in the RECORD at this particular time. But I refer to its comparisons where the Wall Street Journal time and time again has come out again and again with certain misstatements.  
   In 1996, when everyone from the Wall Street Journal to the Christian Science Monitor was dismissing the Japanese economy as sluggish or stagnant or even mired in a deep slump, in fact Japan's growth rate that year of 3.9 percent was the best of any major economy and was significantly superior to the rate of 2.8 percent recorded in the booming United States....... 
   Although experts like the Economist's editor in chief ..... predicted a decade ago that Japan's savings rate would plunge in the 1990s, the truth is that at last count Japan was producing $708 billion of new savings a year--or nearly 60 percent more than America's total of $443 billion.......Japan has now decisively surpassed the United States as the world's main source of capital.......Japan's net external assets jumped from $294 billion to $891 billion in the first seven years of the 1990s. By contrast, America's net external liabilities ballooned from $71 billion to $831 billion.  
   With these things going on, you begin to worry where you are 
   headed with the particular trade bill. 
   Again, instead of doubling the volume of steel imports since 1983, the United States remains by far the largest importer.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. DASCHLE is right. Mr. LOTT had not allowed a wish list of protectionist amendments. You see, Mr. LOTT had given fast track to this particular bill, until this morning, he said yesterday afternoon, but that was without notice. I went back to get some amendments. When I was getting those amendments at 5:30, they closed this Senate Chamber down. They didn't want amendments. Now he says you can get amendments. Here is what the Wall Street Journal thinks:  
   Pennsylvania's steel front-man Rick Santorum on ``antidumping negotiations,'' Iowa protectionist Tom Harkin on child labor, Michigan's Carl Levin (a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Auto Workers) on ``worker rights,'' among others. None of this has anything to do with Africa trade.  
   It doesn't? Child labor doesn't have anything to do with Africa trade, with Caribbean Basin Initiative trade? It doesn't? Wait until the Senator from Iowa comes out here and presents his amendment. That is how arrogant they have gotten. They splash a bunch of things people would not understand. It has everything to do with it. In fact, those are the principal amendments the Senator from South Carolina has. If the Senator from Delaware would agree to them, we could move on with this bill. 
   Specifically, in NAFTA we had the labor side agreements. They are not included in the CBI/sub-Sahara. In NAFTA, we had the environmental side agreements. Not in CBI/sub-Sahara. In the Mexican NAFTA, we had reciprocity. Not in CBI, not in sub-Sahara. In fact, when the Senator from New York jumped back 65 years, to 1934, I didn't hear him enunciate clearly reciprocal trade agreements of Cordell Hull, reciprocity. They had hard, good businessmen. Trade was trade, not a moral thing of foreign aid. That is our problem today. Too many in the political world think about trade as aid, another Marshall Plan. And the Marshall Plan has worked. But there is a limit to what you can give away. 
   I have time and again said that two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported. One-third of all consumption in the United States is imported right now. If this train continues, it will be over half within the next 5 years. That is the hollowing out. If we are going to follow the London economists and the Brits who went from the production of goods to the providing of services--a service economy--we are going to have minimal growth. They got a British Army, but it is not as big as our Marine Corps. But we are going to lose influence in the World Trade Organization, in GATT, treaties in the Mideast and everywhere else, because money talks. We don't have those things going. 
   Now, Mr. President, reciprocal trade. I have an amendment on reciprocity, one on labor rights, and I have one with respect to the matter of the environment. It was all included. Let me just note, this is with tremendous interest to this particular Senator because I have just picked up this week's Time magazine. What we really have, in essence, is the campaign finance bill of 1999. They say they are not going to pass it, but this is the campaign finance bill of 1999. 
   In the middle, on pages 38 and 39, is an open-page Buyers Guide To Congress. Down here listed is the Caribbean tariff relief, a bill to let the Caribbean and Central American countries export apparel to the United States duty and quota free. Then you can go down to the contributions. The clothing firms want access to cheap-tax-advantage offshore production both Clinton and Republicans favor as a free trade measure. 
   They have in here--yes, the manufacturing and retail side is Sara Lee Corporation, Gap, the ATMI, and everything on the one side, and the AFL-CIO anti-sweat-shop groups. We have seen where that sort of split is. They are going along now with service labor leader John Sweeney and not with the manufacturing jobs in America. 
   Then we go to last week's edition, and we have the fruit of its labor. We see that, in addition to Sara Lee, we have Bill Farley and the Fruit of the Loom group. It is just embarrassing to me when you take Farley, who already moves 17,000 jobs out of Kentucky and some 7,000 from Louisiana, and then he gets a $50 million bonus when this bill passes. They are talking about how we are going to help working Americans. Then, all we have to do is go back to this week's London Economist again, in the very first part of the magazine section. We can put that in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. It says:  
   How things have changed. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, a Washington watchdog group, by the end of June this year, contributions from the computer industry were already three times those given to Bill Clinton and Bob Dole combined during the 1996 campaign. Of the $843,000 in direct industry contributions, over one-third went to George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, with the two Democrats--Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley--both netting about half of the Texas Governor's total. These figures tell only part of the story, however. They do not include contributions from telecommunications and biotech companies, nor the millions of dollars the candidates have received in fundraisers organised by computer executives and venture capitalists: entrepreneurs who helped fuel the high-tech boom, and are now helping pave the way to the White House.  
   And on and on. If they can see it in downtown London and on Main Street America with the headline, ``The Buyer's Guide To Congress,'' and list in this particular bill the Caribbean tariff relief bill, we Senators don't have any pride. Is there no shame? Can't we understand what is going on and that NAFTA doesn't help the workers in South Carolina? We lost all the jobs. What few remain, they are saying the high-tech revolution has passed by, and it says the info revolution escapes them. 
   If I could get Gates to South Carolina tomorrow morning, I would bring him in. He is a wonderful industry and everything else. At least give President Reagan credit; we subsidized the semiconductor industry by putting in a voluntary restraint agreement and Sematech. 
   That is why we would have Intel and otherwise gone. Yes; we have moments of sobriety in this particular body. But it is election 2000. It is all financing, and the buying of the Congress. They ought to be ashamed to bring this bill. 
   But I will make the Senator from Delaware a deal. If he will accept a side agreement on labor similar to what we have on NAFTA, and a side agreement that we have on NAFTA with respect to the environment and reciprocity, we would not even have to. Those amendments ought to be accepted. They were on the NAFTA agreement. If he will accept those, I will sit down, and we can go ahead and vote on this particular bill. I make that proposal to the distinguished Senator from Delaware. After he has had a chance to study it, I hope to hear from him because it would save all of us a lot of time. 
   I have had relevant amendments, instead of the ``Hollings filibuster'' all last week. The majority leader filibustered. He knew how to do what he wanted to do. He filled the tree where you couldn't put up those amendments. You couldn't put up any kind of amendment with respect to child labor. You couldn't put up in any amendments with respect to trade. He filled the tree. He forced fast track. It was a bill with his amendments, take it or leave it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the amendment has been read in its entirety. It is very brief and much to the point. It is similar to the North American agreement on labor. When we debated NAFTA at length, there was a great deal more participation and attention given. In these closing days, everyone is anxious to get out of town. Most of the attention has been given, of course, to the appropriations bills and the budget, and avoiding, as they say, spending Social Security after they have already spent at least $17 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had a very interesting experience with respect to labor conditions in Mexico prior to the NAFTA agreement. I wanted to see with my own eyes exactly what was going on. I visited Tijuana, which is right across the line from southern California. 
   I was being led around a valley. There were some 200,000 people living in the valley, with beautiful plants, mowed lawns, flags outside. But the 200,000 living in the valley were living in veritable hovels; the living conditions were miserable. 
   I was in the middle of the tour when the mayor came up to me and asked if I would meet with 12 of the residents of that valley. I told him I would be glad to. He was very courteous and generous. 
   I met with that group. In a few sentences, summing up what occurred, the Christmas before--actually around New Year's--they had a heavy rain in southern California and in the Tijuana area. With that rain, the hardened and crusted soil became mushy and muddy and boggy, and the little hovels made with garage doors and other such items started slipping and sliding. In those streets, there are no light poles and there are no water lines. There is nothing, just bare existence. 
   They were all trying to hold on to their houses and put them back in order. These particular workers missed a day of work. Under the work rules in Mexico, if you miss a day of work, you are docked 3 days. So they lost 4 days' pay. 
   Around February, one of the workers was making plastic coat hangers--the industry had moved from San Angelo to Tijuana. They had no eye protection whatsoever. The machines were stamping out the plastic, and a flick of plastic went into the worker's eye. The  workers asked for protection and could not get any. That really teed them off. 
   It came to a crisis on May 1 when the favorite supervisor, a young woman who was expecting at the time, went to the front office. She said she was sick and would have to take off the rest of the day. They said: No, you are not taking off the rest of the day; you are working. Later that afternoon, she miscarried, and that exploded the movement of these 12 workers. They said: We are not going to stand for this anymore. We are going to get some consideration of working conditions and pay. 
   The workers chipped in money and sent two of the folks up to Los Angeles to employ a lawyer. They discovered that when the plant moved from San Angelo to Mexico, they filled out papers showing how the plant was organized and that they had a union and swapped money each month, but no shop steward or union representatives ever met with them. They never knew anything about a union. 
   Under the work rules of the country of Mexico, if one tries to organize a plant once one is already organized, then that person is subject to firing, and all 12 of them were fired. They lost their jobs, their livelihoods. That is what the mayor wanted me to know and understand. They were out of work. 
   My colleagues talk about the immigration problem. If I had any recommendation for the 12, I would say: Sneak across the border--don't worry about it--and find work in California or South Carolina or some other place because they could not get a job any longer in the country of Mexico. 
   That concerned me, and I have followed the work conditions. That is one of the reasons with NAFTA, while I opposed it, I wanted to be sure we had the side agreements. The side agreements were established. The work center is in Dallas. The Secretary of Labor meets with them. They are trying to work on this problem. 
   I have references to some of the working conditions in El Salvador. 
   On March 13, 1999, five workers from the Doall factory, where 
   Liz Claiborne garments are sown, met with a team of graduate students from Columbia University who were in El Salvador conducting a study of wage rates in relation to basic survival needs. 
   A few days later, all five workers were fired. Doall's chief of personnel simply told them: You are fired because you and your friends cried before the gringos, and the Koreans don't want unionists at this factory. 
   So much for workers' rights in that Liz Claiborne plant. 
   There are 225 maquila assembly factories in El Salvador, 68,000 workers sending 581 million garments a year to the United States worth $1.2 billion. Yet there is not one single union with a contract in any of these maquila factories because it is against the law; it is not allowed. 
   This is Yolanda Vasquez de Bonilla:  
   I was fired from the Doall Factory No. 3 together with 17 others on August 5, 1998. 
   From the beginning, the unbearable working conditions in the factory impressed me a great deal, which included obligatory overtime hours every day of the week, including Saturdays and sometimes Sundays. On alternate days, we worked until 11 p.m., and some weeks we were obligated to work every day until 11 p.m. at night. We were mistreated, including being yelled at and having vulgar words used against us ..... humiliated for wanting to use the restrooms, and being denied permission to visit the Salvadoran Social Security Institute for medical consults. 
   The highest wage I received, working 7 days a week and more than 100 hours, was 1,200 colones (U.S. $137). Nevertheless, I accepted all this that I have briefly narrated since I have two children who are in school and I must support them.  
   They go on to tell similar stories time and again about different workers at that plant in El Salvador. 
   With the limited time I have, I will reference the United States firm in Guatemala City of Phillips-Van Heusen.  
   Van Heusen closed its Camisas Modernas plant in Guatemala City just before its 500 workers were to receive their legally mandated year-end bonuses and go on a three-week break.  
   That is typical of what they do if they get any kind of benefits at all. Just at the end of the year, when they are supposed to get their bonuses, they go down and close the plant.  
   Unionist and former Zacapa municipal worker Angel Pineda was ambushed and shot to death March 8 in the village of San Jorge, Zacapa. Pineda was a mayoral candidate nominated by the leftist New Guatemala Democratic Front. According to the Guatemalan Workers Central, Pineda had participated in a campaign to remove Zacapa Mayor Carlos Roberto Vargas on corruption charges. Another union leader and Vargas opponent was shot to death in January.  
   Then again in Guatemala:  
   A recent U.N. report said poverty encompasses 60 percent of the urban population and 80 percent of rural inhabitants. Figures from the Institute for Economic and Social Investigations of San Carlos University are even more devastating, reporting that 93 percent of the indigenous population lives in poverty and 81 percent cannot meet nutritional needs.  
   Mr. President, again:  
   Workers from more than a dozen different factories complain about everything from restricted bathroom visits and sore backs to illegal firings and abuse. 
   Sewing machines hum and rock music blares as 13-year-old Maria furiously folds clothes inside a Guatemalan factory called Sam Lucas S.A.  
   Maria is a 13-year-old. According to the Wall Street Journal, of course, that has nothing to do with any employee in the Caribbean Basin Initiative or Africa.  
   The Grade 2 dropout folds 50 shirts an hour, or 2,700 shirts a week that will end up in North American stores. 
   Sometimes Maria's boss extends her 10-hour day and asks her to stay until 10:30 p.m. or all night, assembling clothes for export in this tax-free plant called a maquila..... . 
   Forced overtime, union busting, no social security benefits and unpaid work are typical grievances of factory staff, who are mostly young, female, Indian, and poor.  
   Mr. President, in Honduras:  
   A two-week strike at the Korean-owned Kimi de Honduras maquiladora ended September 2 after they dropped criminal charges against the union and accepted a new pay scale. The strike began August 18 when 500 workers, mostly women, demanded compliance with a March union contract. [This particular plant] produces apparel for U.S. retailer J.C. Penney and is part of the eight-plant Continental Park, a free-trade zone in La Lima. Unionized Kimi workers closed down Continental [in] August with blockades, but anti-riot police arrived August 30. In solidarity, most workers from other factories refused to enter the zone, but were subsequently beaten and gassed by the police. Kimi union officials promptly distributed leaflets to workers of other factories, urging them to return to work and prevent more violence. Some 100,000 workers are employed in the country's 200 maquilas, which export $1.6 billion in goods to the United States each year.  
   You have the Roca Suppliers Search maquiladora in El Salvador:  
   The Roca Suppliers Search maquiladora in the town of Mejicanos was abruptly closed November 19, leaving 240 workers laid off. The workers say production was moved to another factory after a group of 22 workers met with representatives of the progressive union federation. [They really work and make] U.S. brands including Calvin Klein and L.L. Bean. The factory's owner said the shop closed due to a lack of raw materials. Labor activists noted that the termination came just before legally mandated Christmas bonuses. The bonuses average about $40.  
   Then again, in El Salvador: They work from Monday through Friday, from 6:50 a.m. to 6:10 p.m., and on Saturday until 5:40 p.m., and occasional shifts to 9:40 p.m. It is common for the cutting and packing departments to work 20-hour shifts from 6:50 a.m. to 3 a.m.  
   Anyone unable or refusing to work the overtime hours will be suspended and fined, and upon repeat ``offenses,'' they will be fired. 
   There is no time clock. Records of an employee's overtime hours are written in a log by the supervisor. Workers report that it is not uncommon to be short changed two hours of overtime if the supervisor is angry with them. 
   There is a one 40-minute break in the day for lunch from noon to 12:40 p.m. 
   All new workers must undergo and pay for a pregnancy test. If they test positive, they are immediately fired. The test costs two days' wages.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, again quoting:  
   In September, Jiovanni Fuentes, a union organizer assisting the workers at Caribbean Apparel, received a death threat from the company. He was told that he and his friends should leave work, or they would be killed. He was told that he was dealing with the Mafia, and in El Salvador, it costs less than $15 to have someone killed.  
   I could go on and on. Obviously, these working conditions are not to the attention of this particular body. They could care less. 
   Labor conditions are very important. The standard of living in the United States of America is an issue. When you open up a manufacturing plant, it is required that you have clean air, clean water, minimum wage, safe working machinery, safe working conditions, plant closing notice, parental leave, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment compensation. All of these particulars are needed. These elevate to the high standard of American living. And it deserves protection. At least it deserves a negotiation--which we included in the NAFTA agreement--in this particular CBI and sub-Saharan agreement. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am sort of stunned in a way because the argument is made that this is going to forestall the jobs that are intended under the bill. 
   Could it really be that we want to finance 13-year-olds and child labor? 
   Could it be that they have to work 100 hours a week at 13 cents an hour? 
   Could it be if they become pregnant and have to go home sick that they are fired? 
   I could go down the list of things. 
   That is what I just pointed out. I am confident my colleagues don't want to finance those kinds of atrocities. 
   I am just stunned that someone would say this would hold it up because the agreement is yet to be had. The agreement is to be joined by the authorities and the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the other countries down there in the Caribbean Basin. If they haven't agreed, obviously, they couldn't be in violation, or they couldn't be with the side agreement. 
   That is why it is very innocent language suggesting that the benefits don't take effect until we have had a chance to sit down, both sides, and decide what will be agreed to and what will be done by the particular governments. So it would be violations of their own government policies.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. From that article:  
   Environmentalists persuasively argued that the Mexican government violated its own environmental laws when it assessed the potential impact of the pier, designed to accommodate more and larger cruise ships. 
   ``We proved that the Mexican government violated the law,'' said Gustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Environmental Law Center, one of the organizations that raised  the issue. ``It is an enormous victory for international environmental rights.''  
   The emphasis, of course, is that there are those in the countries involved with labor rights and with the environment. They are not purely nomads. They have an environmental movement in Mexico and in Canada. 
   We would help to extend environmental concerns and labor rights with this particular agreement if they adopt these two amendments. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator withhold? When he moves to table, that will terminate all debate, as I understand it. 
   I want to offer one more amendment. But with respect to the environmental amendment, it is clear the distinguished chairman of Finance says: Look, this environmental side agreement we had in NAFTA would now discourage investment. It didn't discourage investment in Mexico and didn't discourage investment in Canada. It would not discourage investment. What we are saying is before you open up as compared to the CBI, you have to have clean air and clean water and the environmental protection statements. You have to have all of these particular requirements. But, by the way, if you want to get rid of them, then go down to the CBI. 
   The message is clear. This is what you might call the Job Export Act of 1999.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Tariffs on textiles, the 10-percent tariff, which is ready to be blended out, in the blending out and termination of the Multifiber Arrangement in the next 5 years. Be that as it may, we have, in the Dominican Republic a tariff of 43 percent plus 8 percent VAT; El Salvador, 37.5 plus; Honduras, 35 percent plus; Guatemala, 40 percent; Costa Rica, 39; Jamaica, 40; Nicaragua, 35; 40 percent to Trinidad. We have a similar group of tariffs with respect to the tariffs in Africa: the Central African Republic, 30 percent; Cameroon, 30; Chad, 30; Congo, 30; Ethiopia, 80 percent; Gabon, 30 percent; Ghana, 25; Kenya, 80 percent; Mauritius, 88; Nigeria, 55 percent; Tanzania, 40; Zimbabwe, 200 percent. 
   I plead for reciprocity. I plead for the information revolution, which somehow bypassed me according to this morning's editorial in the Wall Street Journal. 
   With respect to tariffs on computer hardware and software, we are trying to make sure they do not do transshipments, as the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin has pointed out, and in turn, include such tariffs as: Ethiopia, 50 percent on computer hardware and software; Ghana, 25 percent, plus a 35-percent customs tax, plus a 40-percent entry tax on software and a 12.5-percent complementary tax on hardware. 
   They are keeping out these advancements due to these high tariffs. This will help not just the African countries, but protect the computer information age material. 
   In Lesoto, 18 percent plus a 14-percent VAT. 
   In Malawi, 45-percent tariff plus a 20-percent surcharge. 
   In Mozambique, 35-percent tariff plus a 30-percent tax on computer disks, a 5-percent circulation tax. 
   In Senegal, 20 percent with a 20-percent VAT plus 5-percent stamp tax, for a total of 45 percent. 
   In Sudan, 40 percent. 
   In Tanzania, 30 percent plus a 30-percent sales tax plus a 5-percent surtax. That is a 65-percent tax. 
   In Zambia, 25 percent and a 20-percent sales tax. 
   In Zimbabwe, a 40-percent tariff plus a 10-percent surcharge, for a total of 50 percent. 
   Going down that list, we have traded a lot of things, and this does not just relegate itself to textiles, it relegates itself to all trade. 
   The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is pointing out, very appropriately, the transshipments. We encourage the transshipments without reciprocity. That is why we put it into NAFTA. It should be part of this. We voted on this. It was supported by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member with NAFTA. I do not see why they cannot support it now rather than moving to table the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. 
   One of the areas I am trying to find with respect to the amount of work or the amount of production or percent of production of an article, it was found by merely placing the label on the article because one had to unload, load back, and assimilate in a particular way in order to get the label. The mere labeling was considered to be 20 percent. That would have complied with parts of this particular CBI/Sub-Sahara bill. 
   The requirement of the Senator from Wisconsin at 60 percent makes sure we can't get this specious argument about the percentage and the extra work of loading and unloading and putting it through a different set of machinery, tools, adding a label. That constitutes 20 percent. I understand the intent is to get investment and jobs with respect to the Caribbean Basin and with respect to the sub-Sahara countries. There is no question it is well considered. It ought to be at least 60 percent, as called for by Senator FEINGOLD's amendment. 
   With respect to my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, dramatically asking the question, Can anybody name a country where they don't want American investment? That is very easily done. Go to Japan. They started this. Companies still can't get investment there unless the investment doesn't pay off as an investment. Companies have to have a license technology, make sure the jobs are there, make sure the profits stay there. 
   We have been trying to invade the Japanese market for 50 years without success. They have their Ministry of Finance. They have their Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI). There is no question, companies can't get in there. 
   Go to China. Ask Boeing how they got in China. Read the book ``One World Ready or Not.'' It was pointed out, 40 percent of the Boeing 777 parts are not made up in Seattle or anywhere in the United States; they are made by investments in China. How do those investments happen? They said yes, you  can invest here if you license the technology, if you produce the parts and create the jobs here and keep your profits here. That is fine business. 
   To the rhetorical question, Does anyone know of a country that doesn't want the American dollar? That is what they are talking about. I can tell Members, as we look at the stock market, they are going from the American dollar to the Japanese yen or to the Deutsche mark. We will be devaluing that dollar shortly at the rate of $300 billion trade deficit and $127 billion fiscal deficit. We did not run a surplus at the end of September; we ran a deficit of $127 billion. That is according to the Treasury's own figures we submitted. 
   Yes, I can answer that question readily. These countries don't want investment unless you can get what I am trying to get. I am trying to get the jobs. I am trying to get the investment. 
   Don't tell a southern Governor how to carpetbag. We have been doing that for years on end. I know it intimately. I have traveled all over this country trying to solicit and bring industry to South Carolina. I was the first Governor in the history of this country to go to Latin America, and later took a gubernatorial mission after the election in 1960 with some 27 State Governors, trying to get investment into South Carolina. I traveled to Europe. I called on Michelin in June of 1960. Now we have beautiful plants and the North American headquarters of Michelin. We can go down the list. 
   We know how to do it, and the others are doing it to us. We understand that. However, there is a degree of takeover, so to speak, or export of these jobs. We cannot afford it, particularly in the textile area. It will happen in all the other hard industries, as has been characterized by Fingleton, if this continues. 
   Rather than talk about the agriculture getting a special trade representative--agriculture is never left out. The Secretary of Agriculture is always there, the special trade representative, the export-import financing is there; everything is there for agriculture. I don't mind them putting this amendment on there, but it points up, if Members get politically the right support, they can get their amendment accepted around here even though it is not germane and it is not relevant. 
   However, if one gets a good amendment as required, as both the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member required in the NAFTA bill, it was included in the NAFTA bill. Fortunately, the ranking member did vote with us. The chairman of the Finance Committee went along and supported the side agreements with respect to labor, the side agreement with respect to the environment, and the reciprocity from both Canada and Mexico.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware said this amendment would discourage investments. The very same amendment was included at his behest in the Finance Committee on NAFTA. It has not discouraged investment whatever in Mexico. On the contrary, the Koreans, the Chinese, Taiwanese, the Americans, everyone is investing like gangbusters down in Mexico. 
   That is what they talk about, the success of NAFTA. So this is worded to include the language exactly as they have included it in the NAFTA agreement. Could it be on labor rights that this body wants to put a stamp of approval on a situation such as the example I gave of a 13-year-old young girl working 100 hours at 13 cents an hour until 3 in the morning? Do we want that kind of thing going on? 
   I am sure we do not want to put the stamp of approval on the threats they will be killed when they ask for certain labor considerations down in Honduras. I went through all of those particular examples. 
   We do not want to invest in scab labor. What we want to invest in is an opportunity and an improved lot with the Caribbean Basin Initiative here. So it is, the amendment should not be tabled. It is in force, working with respect to NAFTA. There is no reason why it cannot work in this particular place.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment is nothing more than the previous amendment on side agreements on labor. This one would require the side agreements with respect to the environment. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows I know the feeling of strength out on the west coast for the environment. I have traveled up there, for example, in Puget Sound and have had the hearings with Dixie Lee Ray when she was the oceanographer, John Linberg, and all the rest. I come back to the statement by my distinguished ranking member quoted in the Wall Street Journal this morning----

   Mr. HOLLINGS. As quoted in the morning Wall Street Journal, the distinguished Senator MOYNIHAN of New York said:  
   We were planning to spend a few days in Seattle, just meeting people.  
   But if you could not get this bill passed, they would not have any credibility.  
   I don't want to show my face.  
   I know in general the Democrats are considered prolabor and the Republicans are considered generally as antilabor. But with respect to the environment it has been bipartisan. There  was no stronger protector of the environment than our late friend, John Chafee of Rhode Island. He led the way for Republicans and Democrats. I would not want to show my face in Seattle, having voted that you could not even sit down, talk, and negotiate something on the environment, the very same provisions that the chairman of the Finance Committee required in the NAFTA agreement. It is in the NAFTA agreement. I am only saying, since we are going to extend NAFTA to the CBI, let's put the same requirements there with consideration for the environment.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, by this vote we will determine whether we are for foreign aid or foreign trade. The truth is that the Marshall Plan in foreign aid is really a wonderful thing. We have defeated communism with capitalism. It has worked. 
   But now after 50 years, with running deficits in excess of $100 billion for some 20 years, we are just infusing more money into the economy than we are willing to take in. There was the deficit of $127 billion here just at the end of September for the year 1999; otherwise, running a deficit in the balance of trade of $300 billion; then with our current account deficit totaling $726 billion in the last 7 years and our net external assets really in the liabilities over the last 7 years from $71 billion to $831 billion. 
   We are going out of business. It would be a wonderful thing. But let's have some reciprocity. All we are saying is, when we make an agreement, we take some of these particular regulations affecting, for example, textiles--there is a whole book of them here--and if we lower ours, let them lower theirs. 
   Cordell Hull, 65 years ago, with the reciprocal trade agreements of 1934, is what got the country going again industrially, and that is what will get it going again if we obey the reciprocity that we included in NAFTA. 
   All I am trying to do, if we are going to extend NAFTA, let's have the same reciprocity we had in NAFTA in these particular CBI agreements.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I remember the distinguished minority leader's plea about protecting the rights of colleagues. Now instead of protecting the rights, we are given our rights on the installment plan. If you get in line for your installment, fine business. 
   Like the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, he has an amendment that the majority leader was just presenting to grant permanent and normal trade relations status to Albania. Isn't that grand? We have gone from CBI, to the sub-Sahara, and now we are back to Albania. Next thing you know, we will have a Kosovo amendment protecting Members' rights to present amendments. You can get in the back room and work this out. 
   Here is another one. The Dodd-Ashcroft-Bond amendment that would allow a company with operations in Connecticut and Missouri to obtain the  refund on duties paid on imports of nuclear fuel assemblies. Isn't that wonderful? They can bring up that amendment. That is germane. I am sure it is because down in the Caribbean Basin, they have a lot of nuclear down there, particularly in the sub-Sahara. I have traveled there and I have gone to see all the nuclear plants in Nigeria and Ghana and the Republic of Congo, Brazzaville, the French Congo, and the rest. It is wonderful to see all those nuclear powerplants. That is another germane amendment. 
   Then the distinguished Senator from Montana has a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that it is the Senate's view that Japan should open its telecommunications sector. Now we have gone from CBI, to sub-Sahara, and we are all the way around to Japan now. With this deal, you can move things around. It is bargain basement time-- this sort of parliamentary Filene's that opened up on the weekend. I did not know you could get all of these things over the weekend. 
   The Roth amendment, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee would ensure existing reports regarding trade-related matters are submitted to the Finance and Ways and Means Committees in addition to the committees already designated. We have the Government Operations Committee with jurisdiction in this bill. 
   Clarification regarding rules of origin for silk products, an amendment requested by the President. Tell him to run for the Senate like his wife. 
   An amendment requested by the President to clarify the rules of origin regarding silk products. This clarification is part of a settlement reached in a dispute between the United States and the European Union--not sub-Sahara, not CBI, not a Senator, but sooey pig, everybody come, just get whatever you want. 
   I am ready to deal because I have worked into a position where I can deal now. That is the way trade is treated in the Senate. It is a very sad thing for the main and simple reason we have an extremely important matter not only for textiles but with respect to the general mindset of the National Government. 
   I have heard time and again on the floor of the Senate how the e-commerce and the telecommunications industry, the information society, the semiconductors, software, Microsoft, and all the rest are an engine that is really barreling this economy forward of the United States. I was very interested in reading over the weekend about the impact. I refer in particular to the October 30 edition of the London Economist:  
   A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the digital economy--  
   That is what they are talking about--  
   the hardware and software of the computer and telecoms industries--amounts to 8% of America's GDP this year. If that sounds rather disappointing, then a second finding--that it has accounted for 35% of total real GDP growth since 1994, which should keep e-fanatics happy. 
   Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of ``technology'' is too wide. They argue that since such things as basic telecom services, television, radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages and they should be excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP....... 
   But what, might you ask, about the Internet? Goldman Sachs's estimate includes Internet service providers, such as America Online, and the technology and software used by online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It does not, however, include transactions over the Internet. Should it? E-business is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an Internet consultancy, estimates that this will increase to more than $1.5 trillion in America by 2003. Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to about 13% of GDP. Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods and services, whose production owes nothing to the Internet. The value added of Internet sales--i.e., its contribution to GDP--would be much less, probably little more than 1% of GDP.  
   But with the contributions, it has a 100-percent impact on this particular body when we would see it with about 1-percent impact actually on the economy. But politically it has gotten where you pick it up in the weekend news magazines. Time magazine--talking about the move of Fruit of the Loom, with its 17,000 jobs from Kentucky, its 7,000 jobs from Louisiana, going down to the Cayman Islands, with its executives contributing over $500,000 to the Presidential race of Gov. George W. Bush, and others, and of course of, the Democrats. They know how to give to both sides. 
   But with those contributions, it is not 1 percent of the effect, it is 100 percent, and we come around and start changing the rules. When the computer industry came to town--that was American Online, Gateway, and all the rest of them--our friend Bill Gates, talked all of us. We sat around the table and then rushed out with Y2K legislation. It can't even happen until a couple months from now or more, but we changed all the State tort laws. Why? Because of the contributions. 
   I think they have an article with respect to just exactly that in the same magazine. Here in the magazine they have taken judicial notice, as we used to say in the law:  
   The rise of America's high-tech industry is not just a windfall for presidential hopefuls. It could also be a godsend for the liberal political tradition.  
   But the high-tech industry have come to town now, and they have doubled their effort on all scores.  
   The Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group founded two years ago in Silicon Valley, has just set up a second office in Austin, and plans to open more chapters in the future--an attempt to influence policy at both state and local level. Companies in Washington, DC--home of America Online, America's biggest Internet service provider, and a city where the computer industry has just taken over from government as the biggest local employer--have also started their own lobbying group, CapNet.  
   Oh, boy it goes on and on and says, wait a minute, it has the largest contribution group in all of Washington all of a sudden. Five years ago they were not even around. 
   That is what it says on page 23 of this October 30 edition of the London Economist. 
   You ought to read these magazines. Somehow, maybe that is what colleagues can do on the weekends. Because if you read Time magazine, if you read the London Economist, if you read the Washington Post, you can find out what influence it can have up here. 
   The devastating impact, of course, is somehow, really, we ought to get rid of the textile industry and we ought to get rid of all these smokestack industries and everything else. That is what they said to them in Great Britain years ago: that we will go from a nation of brawn to a nation of brains; instead of providing products, we will provide services; instead of creating wealth, we will handle it. Of course, they have gone to second rate. They have the lowest GDP growth and have created two levels of society. 
   I came over only because of the unanimous consent request. But I have the articles with respect to the U.S. News & World Report, and Mort Zuckerman 2 weeks ago, that I had inserted into the RECORD about how we are going to two levels of society. Now we see the magazines and the title:  
   The new economy e-exaggeration. The digital economy is much smaller than you think.  
   It is really a bummer for the main and simple reason it does not create jobs, it does not help with the exports. It is not helping with the growth at all. It is small income growth, and imbalanced mix of jobs, and a poor export prospect. In fact, Eamonn Fingleton, the distinguished author of ``Blindside,'' now has put out his book ``In Praise of Hard Industries,'' and compares exactly the hard industries and their contributions to the economic security and power of a nation compared with the e-commerce or the information society, what he calls the deindustrialization group.  
   The postindustrial jobs, that is what it is, the postindustrial jobs of people of considerably higher than average intelligence. It does create jobs for the top 2 or 3 percent. You have to be a whiz kid to be one of the 22,000 who work for Bill Gates out there at Microsoft in Redmond, WA. I have had the privilege of visiting there and meeting with those folks.  
   Right to the point, according to Time magazine, with their stock options, you have 22,000 millionaires. They are well paid. But heavens above, that is not middle America. That is not jobs for everybody. What we are talking about is--of course, the computerization, has assisted--but more than anything else, with robotics we have become a very productive society for not the best IQ laborers in our society but  for normal folks such as you and me who can get the job. 
   According to Fingleton and Michael Rothchild, 20 percent of the American workforce will be marginalized by the move to an information-based economy. That amounts to a shocking 25 million people. We are not just talking about textiles for the CBI and sub-Sahara. We are talking about the basic, formative industry in America really supporting our society. And with 25 million, they can give you all of these particular statistics about unemployment and otherwise, but I can tell you now, those are retail jobs and part-time jobs for people who have lost their jobs in textiles--some 31,200 in South Carolina since NAFTA--that they have had to seek out as best they can. That is a loss of some 25 million jobs. It is a slow-income growth. For example, the ultimate authority on the income growth or the new economy is the Organization of European Community Statistics and Figures, the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.  
   For those who believe in the superiority of the U.S. postindustrial strategy, the 1998 edition of the yearbook makes distinctly chastening reading. It shows, with a per capita income--about $27,821 a year--the United States trails no fewer than eight other nations.  
   Last week when I was talking about the United States going out of business, look at this: We trail Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland. You can go right on down the list. They are into the manufacturing and the middle class of America. Manufacturing over in those other economies have outpaced the United States in interim growth 
   with 134 percent compared to our 106 percent over the same period. The wages of America's post-industrial workers are generally much higher than the American average. Naisbitt jumps to the completely fallacious conclusion that a general shift by the United States into post-industrialism or the information society will result in a general boost in wages. The fallacy here is that Naisbitt assumes that post-industrial wages are higher by dint of the superior economic virtues. In reality, the high wages paid, such as in the software industry, merely reflect the fact that some businesses generally recruit exceptionally intelligent and capable workers. But it is a very small group of people earning this income. 
   The leader in income growth, of course, for the entire period from 1980 to 1998 is South Korea, because it has gone, not for high tech, but for hard goods. Of course, they tried to say this information society or post-industrial America is really going to create those jobs, but in truth, it does not. Without those jobs, they have slow income growth and poor export prospects. 
   We have all been talking about the matter of agriculture, which is a magnificent contribution to our exports. We used to export a lot of hard goods because we manufactured and produced hard goods. Last week, I put into the RECORD that we have really gone out of business with respect to shoes and textiles and machine tools and steel. We are importing steel. Can you imagine--the United States of America is a net steel importer. That is why we have had a hard time getting a ruling. We have had to take the case all the way from the International Trade Administration to the commission and back over to the White House trying our dead level best to save the No. 1 industry important to our national security. But we don't have anything now to export. 
   When you look to software, you have the language difficulties, the cultural difficulties with respect to that software. You have the proposition of piracy, and they can steal and reproduce immediately this software overseas. This is the most important thing to emphasize because they have people smart enough about software outside of the United States. They assume all of these skills are just here, which is absolutely fallacious. That is why they are trying to change the immigration laws. 
   The software people are coming up here because they want to take all the smart people the world around and bring them into this country. 
   Let's talk about Japan, which is supposed to be going broke. That has particularly nettled me, and I am glad to get the exact figures, because they have calculated a controlled kind of capitalism through their Ministry of Finance and their Ministry of International Trade and Industry. They allocate the financing of a particular industry and then they control the local market. 
   We act as if we have led the way for 50 years on liberal trade and have broken down the barriers, as one of the distinguished proponents said only last Friday. That is why I brought that thick book. Just on textiles alone, barriers persist around the world, specifically in the sub-Sahara and the CBI, specifically no reciprocity in this particular treaty--that is the thing we are trying to emphasize. Those things continue. Japan now is supposed to have gone broke. Let's see how they compare. 
   The living standards and everything have really improved. In fact, with the so-called almost depression that was described in the Wall Street Journal, there was a less than 4 percent unemployment rate, less than 4 percent in the first 8 years of the 1990s up to early 1999. The highest it had been at any stage was 4.4 percent. Japan's total exports during that period rose by a cumulative 53 percent in the first 8 years. That represents real growth of more than 18 percent. 
   So Japan is still coming on as an economic superpower at this minute--the little island of 125 million versus the great United States with its 260 million. Japan outproduces the United States of 
   America. If it continues at this particular rate, by the end of next year, 2000, it will have a bigger gross domestic product; it will have a larger economy, the largest in the world. 
   John Schmitt and Lawrence Mishel pointed out that the per capita gross domestic product actually grew faster in Japan than in the booming United States for the first 8 years of 1990. The distinguished Senator from New York and the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee started off the debate on Friday that way: What a wonderful economic boom we have had. We have to sober up. We have to look at the real facts. 
   Actually, our competition is growing much stronger and much faster than we are. Japan's performance has been even better than the comparisons suggest. For a start, the figures measured gross domestic product, whereas the most appropriate yardstick for comparison is gross national product. The distinction, of course, is that the GNP is a more comprehensive measure. Unlike gross domestic product, it takes in account the debits and credits relating to cross-border investments. 
   The United States has become an increasingly large net importer of capital in recent years. Its GNP is actually now considerably less than its GDP. By contrast, Japan has long been a major net exporter of capital and its GNP is considerably larger than its GDP. These are the kinds of things that have to be taken into consideration. The yen has been gaining a net 24 percent between 1989 and 1998 on the dollar. 
   I saw that in the Financial Times last week. I put that article in. If we continue with this deficit in the balance of trade, there is bound to be a devaluation. In this regard, if other things are equal, the strength of a nation's currency is the ultimate determinant of the size of its economy, the ultimate symbol of its economic health. In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy felt so strongly about this that he ranked dollar devaluation alongside nuclear war as the two things he feared most. 
   Let us get right to a particularly interesting section here: the clearest evidence of the lengths to which Japanese leaders are prepared to go to understate their economy. They know how to talk rather than run around beating their breasts like American politicians saying how great we are, the only remaining superpower. 
   We are going to blow them off the map and, of course, if they don't move with the Air Force, we are not going to invade, or anything else of that kind. It is almost embarrassing, this braggart attitude of United States politicians.  
   Perhaps the clearest evidence of the lengths to which Japanese leaders are prepared to go to understate their economy's true strengths is in the way they talk about the Japanese Government's budget. All through the 1990s, they have suggested that the government has been running huge deficits--deficits ostensibly intended to stimulate consumption, particularly consumption  of imported goods. So successful have they been in this regard that America's most respected media organizations--organizations of the caliber of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal--have fallen for the story. Thus, year after year, Americans have been treated to a deluge of reports that Japan was supposedly running huge government deficits. In reality, as authoritative figures from OECD demonstrate, Japan was running huge government surpluses. In 1995, for instance, the year when the Wall Street Journal reported that Japan was running a budgetary deficit of 2 percent, the OECD found that the government achieved a budgetary surplus of 3.5 percent. In fact, according to OECD's figures, which were published each year in the widely circulated yearbook OECD In Figures, not only was Japan's surplus one of the strongest of any OECD nation, but Japan was the only major nation that had a budget surplus at all that year. By comparison, the United Kingdom, for instance, ran a deficit of 5.0 percent and America's deficit was 2.2 percent.  
   Well, this Senator knows better than anyone how they didn't really continue to call deficits surpluses. I put that in the RECORD, and I will put it in the RECORD again time after time. The Department of Treasury's figures showed that they had $127 billion deficit last fiscal year. Now, true it is, they had some carry-over amount, which concluded to be about $16 billion. So, at best, it would be $111 billion to $112 billion deficit--not a surplus. That is the debt of treasury at year end, September 30, 1999, for fiscal year 1999--a deficit, not a surplus. But these newspapers pick this up, and we have almost got a cheering section carrying us into bankruptcy. Continuing to read, it says:  
   So how strong is the Japanese economy really?  
   Eamonn Fingleton said, in this book Hard Industries:  
   From his vantage point in Tokyo, he has seen little since then to undermine his confidence in his analysis. Certainly, he has been vindicated in his central point, which was that Japan's current account surpluses would continue to soar in the latter half of the 1990s, thus, giving the lie to much talk in the American press in the mid-1990s that Japan's export industries would be disastrously hollowed out by South Korea and other low-wage East Asian nations. 
   ..... the truth is that, at last count, Japan was producing $708 billion in new savings a year--or nearly 60 percent more than America's total of $443 billion.  
   They are saving twice as much.  
   ..... Japan's net external assets jumped from $294 billion to $891 billion in the first seven years of the 1990s. By contrast, America's net external liabilities ballooned from $71 billion to $831 billion.  
   Madam President, the reason we continue to give these figures with respect to this particular bill is that we are in deeper trouble than most Senators realize. They are all talking about whether they are human, or whether they have on an overcoat, or a jacket, or whatever nonsense it is about running the campaign, and who all is for education. Everybody is for education and wants smaller classrooms, or better math and science programs. We finally got, again--in the U.S. News and World Report, from David Gergen, he got back to my particular premise, that what we ought to do is double the teachers' pay. You get what you pay for. Average 
   pay is $37,000. The average pay in my State is down to $31,000. I see the young graduates coming across the stage and they say: Senator, I would like to have gone into teaching, but I could not save enough money to send my children to college. Yet, we are bumping into each other, saying how we are all for education. We can be all for it or all against it. The most you are going to spend is 7 cents out of every dollar. It is a local matter. We are Senators and we have to get on to the things the local and State governments do not take care of, and that is trade. That is the economic strength and viability and security of the United States, the sustenance of the middle class. That is why I am talking about these particular figures. 
   In the first seven years of the 1990s, America's current account deficits totaled $726 billion, up 79 percent. Thus, despite a massive devaluation of the dollar that supposedly brought a dramatic turnaround in American competitiveness that would soon dispose of the deficits for goods. 
   Madam President, for the first 8 years of the 1990s, Japan's current account surpluses totaled $750 billion. That was more than 2 1/2 times the total of $279 billion recorded in the first 8 years of the 1980s. So all during the `90s, we have been reading and telling each other these fairy tales. One, that the information age is upon us and the information society, and post-industrialism has taken over. The computer software and so forth is the engine of the economy that is barreling us forward into global competition. False. It is taking us down into very precarious straits. We are relying upon it, and we are going to eliminate the middle class and the workforce of America. Otherwise, we have been told time and time again about how Japan has been going down and we have been going up. We have had 8 years of the boom, with the lowest inflation, the lowest unemployment; but we have been giving away the store. 
   Mr. President, I wasn't prepared to get into this general item this afternoon, but it is salutary that we were able to touch on it so we can talk sense to the American people, because what we have with the CBI, the sub-Sahara bill, is an extension of NAFTA to the Caribbean Basin Initiative; and so the sub-Sahara. If you are in with or close to the leadership, you can take care of Japan, Albania, and operations in Connecticut and Missouri to refund some money on nuclear fuel assemblies. You even can get a distilled spirits tax fixed. 
   You watch it. 
   I am going to present an amendment to put side agreements that we had on NAFTA on this particular bill, and you can bet your boots they will stand down there and say it is not germane, having had the audacity to come in with nuclear, Japan, Albania, distilled spirits, and what have you, but not take a formative, relevant, serious concern that we have on this particular bill. 
   I didn't like NAFTA. But, be that as it may, it had side agreements on both the environment and labor. I have a side agreement to present on the environment. I want them to allow us to vote on that side agreement for the CBI and the sub-Sahara. I want them to let us vote--at least a vote. Don't get here with a technicality after you have sneaked in all your Japanese, Albanian, Missouri, and nuclear amendments here this afternoon when nobody is in town and then come tomorrow when the Senate is in full session and say, oh, no, that is not germane; we have rules of rules. They will get to be rules of rules tomorrow. One is reciprocity. We have tariffs that are being really merged out and disassembled out because under the Multifiber Arrangement we had a 10-year blend-out of it and a termination. So now we are entering the last 5 years. 
   But there are still some tariffs that ought to be reconciled with the CBI and the tariffs in the sub-Sahara, so we can get some modicum of reciprocity when they talk about the trade adjustment assistance. That takes gall to do that. They say it is unconscionable to oppose this bill. I will say it takes gall to talk about trade adjustment assistance, which is nothing more than welfare payments putting people out of work. 
   So they say: Hurry up, we have to get this bill done because we have 200,000 of those put out of work who have lost their jobs as a result of these silly trade agreements--these one-way streets that the Senate has ratified and agreed upon. You wouldn't have to have trade adjustment assistance if you just let them trade, if you just let them work, and not put them out of business. 
   But the great merit, according to the senior Senator from New York, on this particular measure is, back in Kennedy's days, 37 years ago, we passed trade adjustment assistance. I don't want that to infer that John F. Kennedy was against textiles. Thirty-eight years ago, President John F. Kennedy put in his seven-point textile program and one-price cotton looking out for the cotton farmer. 
   So the Senator from Massachusetts, then President, was very aware of the economic viability of these United States of America. He knew what was keeping the country strong and what was necessary to keep the country strong. So he put that in. He wasn't bragging about having to put in trade adjustment assistance. He was just trying to reconcile the successful United States at the time with the other trading nations, giving them a chance under the Marshall Plan to rebuild their economies. 
   At that particular time, they said to me, as Governor: Governor, what do  you expect these Third World emerging nations to make? Let them make the textiles and the shoes, and we will continue, and we will make the computers and the airplanes. My problem now, in November 1999, is those countries are making 86 percent of the shoes worn on the floor of the Senate. I can see them now. These countries also are making two-thirds of the clothing that I see, looking at in this Chamber, imported into the United States. 
   Look at the contracts made by USAir and all of the other airlines concerning Airbus. They are making the planes and dumping them here in the United States. They are making the computers and dumping them in the United States. The Japanese have taken over the computer industry, in spite of Sematech, in spite of Microsoft, in spite of Intel. 
   We have to be not pessimists nor optimists but realists. 
   Here on the floor of the Senate is a good moment to really bring everything into focus because the leadership said we are now going to vote cloture tomorrow and the minority leader is not going to ask them to vote against it. That is exactly how NAFTA was passed. 
   I will never forget the New York Times article. I wish I had it. But I will try to get it and put it in the RECORD tomorrow. But in NAFTA, the President then just bought off the sufficient votes to pass NAFTA. I will never forget. He gave a cultural exchange to my friend, Jake Pickle of Texas. He gave two C-17s to another Texas fellow. He gave another particular freebie, and they went down with the 26 giveaways to pick up the 26 votes. 
   Here on this solemn afternoon, we have the same deal going. They are buying off the votes. They are getting it on nuclear fuel assemblies. We are getting it on the Japanese telecommunications. We are getting it on Ways and Means and Finance Committee rules. We are getting it on silk products of the United States and the European Union. We are getting it on Albania. We just go right down--on Kyrgyzstan. What in the world? Kyrgyzstan. I don't know about that. Now we are in Asia Minor. I am almost at Bible school. Asia Minor. This procedure has gotten to be a disgrace. They buy enough votes and they win. They have 11 of them listed here on the so-called managers' amendment. So they put them all in there and take care of those 11 votes so they will know that they will get cloture. 
   It is wonderful to serve in this body. 
   But it is better to be heard because it is important that we be heard. I can tell you here and now, when the ATMI wakes up, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, and they put in the sub-Sahara along with the CBI, I want to see them at that party. They are going to hold a victory party because they supported this particular bill. That is going to happen. That is exactly what is going to occur. You can see the fix is on. They are going to roll over this particular Senator and get rid of what little textile industry we have left. 
   There will be a few of the real competitors; the Roger Millikens will last. They put money in, and they know how to run an industry and they will survive. But generally speaking, they can't survive. The reason they can't survive is on account of us. We Democrats, we Republicans, we Senators and Congressmen have many requirements called the American high standard of light. That standard calls for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, safe working place, safe machinery, clean air, clean water, all of these things, labor rights, and otherwise. And it is one of these things in the global competition that is not required. On the other hand, they have the comparative advantage of their governmental policies. 
   I wish Ricardo were here because he didn't think finance could be transferred so easily, that the bankers would all stay close to their home folks and depositors. Now you can transfer it on satellite by computer, in a flash, and you can get capital anywhere. You can send on a computer chip the technology and save 20 percent of your labor costs by moving to low-wage offshore countries. So a company in the United States with $500 million in sales can save 20 percent, or $100 million, by keeping its main office and its sales force here in the United States, send its manufacturing to a Third World, low-wage country, and make $100 million, or they can continue to work their own people and go broke because of competition. 
   That is why on last week I inserted part of an important book in the RECORD. I will get that book again and show you that all of them are leaving here in the United States--Dan River, the corn mills, Burlington, all of them are going down. It is not the sewing operations alone, it is fabric plants, and, of course, the Japanese, the Koreans, and, most of all, the Chinese, the People's Republic of China. 
   They are whining on the other side of the aisle about most favored nation for China. Look at a most-favored-nation Chinese vote and anyone will see a vote for this bill. 
   China, we have sub-Sahara; put up the front companies and put up the production of the People's Republic of China through the sub-Sahara. 
   The arrangement that those folks relied on some 5 years ago; they better batten down the hatches because I don't know how they will get the money out of the machinery and survive with this particular measure. It is drastic. It is unconscionable. They say we are unconscionable; I say they are unconscionable. 
   We can see how the majorities are fixed. We have not had any real debate on the floor of the Senate on trade as a matter of national policy or otherwise. They say the President wants this; the minority leader says it is his duty to give the President what he wants. The other side of the aisle has been wanting to do away with all kinds of trade agreements and market forces, and Adam Smith has long since gone in this global competition. It ought to depend on market forces. They depend on protection. Of course, so does the other side of the aisle when it comes to intellectual property, movies, books, copyrighting, when it comes to protecting the talents of the individual producers, the authors, writers, singers, and performers. Fine, let's have protection for them. But for those who work by the sweat of their brow, that is protectionism and a terrible thing. We are isolationist and we are unconscionable. 
   Maybe they will have another consent agreement similar to this one, and I will have another opportunity to talk. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues this afternoon.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to recognize my friend Dr. Jim Edwards, who recently retired as president of the Medical University of South Carolina after a distinguished 17-year tenure. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, MUSC is now consistently ranked as one of the top 100 research universities in the country and has established itself as a leader in teaching and patient care. 
   Since Dr. Edwards took the helm at MUSC, the university has graduated more than 10,000 health care professionals who are serving throughout the state and nation. The university also experienced remarkable physical growth under his leadership with the construction of several valuable facilities including the Children's Hospital, the Hollings Cancer Center, the Gazes Institute for Cardiac Research and the Strom Thurmond Biomedical Research Center. The Charleston area is fortunate to have MUSC in its midst. The area's largest employer, MUSC has an impressive economic impact of $1.3 billion annually. 
   Dr. Edwards' vision and drive that helped place MUSC in the medical forefront are talents he developed during the previous two decades as a public servant. He became a politician for all the right reasons. He was the archetypal man fed up with America's ills, but with the uncommon belief that it was his duty to correct them. 
   A successful oral surgeon, Jim served for two years in the South Carolina Senate before resigning to run for governor in 1974. Although the underdog in the race, he emerged the victor, becoming the first Republican governor of South Carolina since Reconstruction. As governor, he passed the Education Finance Act, which helped modernize our state's education system. He also established a reserve fund, created a motor vehicle management office, streamlined the state budgeting process, developed welfare reform procedures, established the Energy Research Institute and launched state government reorganization efforts.  
   His nonpartisan approach to state government was commendable. ``I sincerely believe that during a campaign you ought to be partisan as you can be,'' he told The State newspaper recently, ``and talk about the differences of the two parties. There's plenty there to talk about. ..... But when elected, all this partisan stuff should stop. You ought to work together with whomever the people elected to work with you in government.'' Democrats far outnumbered Republicans in the South Carolina legislature when Jim was governor, yet representatives from both parties have compliments to bestow upon him to this day. He left the Governor's Mansion with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent. 
   A year after Dr. Edwards returned to his dental practice, President Reagan asked him to serve as the nation's energy secretary. True to his commitment to public service, Jim answered the call, moving to Washington to tackle an important national issue. During his tenure, the DOE decontrolled oil, stepped up the pace for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, obtained federal aid for three synthetic fuel projects and shepherded a nuclear waste measure through Congress. In 1982, he moved back to South Carolina and assumed the presidency at MUSC. 
   Dr. Jim Edwards' retirement marks an end to the career of one of South Carolina's finest. His impact will be felt for many years to come. My wife, Peatsy, joins me in wishing Jim and his wonderful wife, Ann, a happy retirement.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act and urge my colleagues to reject the cloture motion to end debate on this ill-advised legislation. 
   Today's proposal offers a unilateral opening of the U.S. market in exchange for no market access commitments from the countries affected. Unlike NAFTA, no negotiations are required for these benefits contained within the legislation to take effect. It is no wonder that the governments of the impacted countries argue in favor of this legislation. 
   This legislation contains limited protections for Caribbean and African workers and offer no protections for the environments in either region. It is essentially an invitation for companies to leave the United States and exploit African and Caribbean workers and the environment. 
   Moreover, today's proposal disrupts a carefully balanced transition in textile and apparel manufacturing industries from a quota system to a less regulated market. 
   Five years ago, in adopting NAFTA and the WTO we established a textile and apparel policy that was designed to be implemented over a 10-year period. We are now halfway through that implementation. 
   Manufacturers, workers, and families made investments and planned their future based on that scheme. It is grossly unfair to all involved to alter that plan in the middle of its implementation. 
   Specifically, the Africa portion of the legislation alters the generalized system of preferences program by permitting increased access to imports from Africa into areas that have traditionally been limited because they are import sensitive. 
   Let me restate that. 
   This package essentially lifts the protections for the most import sensitive products. In short, that means that U.S. workers will lose jobs as a result of this legislation. 
   The protections that this legislation will erase have long been recognized in U.S. trade policy. Proponents of this bill will argue that the ITC has conducted a study that suggests that U.S. job loss will be less than 1,000 jobs. I do not believe the study and will offer an amendment to this legislation that would suspend benefits when textile and apparel job loss exceed 1,000 workers. 
   Moreover, this legislation contains few assurances that the products coming from Africa be made in Africa. In fact, for most products, a minimum of 20 percent of the work can be done in Africa and the benefits of the legislation will still apply to the product. 
   Traditionally, I have expressed concern on a variety of trade initiatives and most particularly with regard to those impacting the textile and apparel complex. 
   South Carolina has 93,000 workers in our textile and apparel industries including 73,000 in the textile industries and 20,500 in the apparel industries. 
   The proposal before the Senate today would essentially condemn the 20,500 employees in the apparel industry (and the 666,000 apparel workers nationally) to unemployment by permitting the duty-free entry, quota free entry of apparel products from Africa and the Caribbean that are made from American fabric--the so-called 807-a, 809 exception. 
   Many will claim that such a provision aids the U.S. textile industry and for a brief time it may. Unfortunately, it decimates the U.S. apparel sector. If the apparel sector is undermined, eventually the textile industry will erode as  well, because manufacturers will always move to be near their customers. 
   Moreover, it is unlikely that the strict provisions that exist in the legislation will remain, once the conference committee completes a reconciliation of this bill with the much more expansive proposal from the House of Representatives. 
   In addition, the principles underlying this legislation assumes that the current tariff situation remains unchanged as result of the new WTO Seattle Round negotiations. Such an outcome is unlikely. 
   This legislation merely continues the ongoing assault by the current administration on America's strong manufacturing base. It will further weaken an already besieged U.S. textile and apparel industry and cost the jobs of countless American workers. 
   This administration has become enchanted by the false promise of ``free trade,'' to the detriment of numerous U.S. industries. While expanding global commerce and benefiting less developed nations are admirable goals, we cannot afford to pursue them if it means dangerously weakening our industrial complex and putting American laborers out of work. 
   I have often spoken on behalf of the beleaguered textile and apparel industry, one that is critical to maintaining a strong U.S. manufacturing base. Currently the United States imports $21 million worth of apparel and fabric for every $6 million that it exports. This margin will likely increase substantially with the implementation of S. 1387. 
   American textile companies cannot compete with the increasing amount of cheap imports that are flooding our markets. Just in the past 17 months, 50 plants have been forced to close their doors, displacing 30,000 workers. And as disturbing as they are, these are just the most recent figures. I use them to underscore the seriousness of a much larger, longer-term problem. 
   In large part it is our previous free trade agreements that are to blame for the losses in textile jobs. During the 36 months prior to implementation of the NAFTA agreement, just 2,000 jobs were lost in the American textile sector. The ensuing 56 months saw job losses rise to 305,000. To put these numbers in perspective, that is over 300,000 families who have lost their major source of income in just the past year and a half. 
   The deterioration of the textile and apparel job market is 
   not only harmful to South Carolina, but is devastating for many parts of the United States. In my State, the past 10 years has seen the number of jobs in the apparel sectors drop from 45,000 to 20,500, a decrease of more than 50 percent. Similarly, Pennsylvania's textile and apparel jobs have dipped from 80,000 jobs to 34,800 since 1989. 
   Some might argue that in place of these jobs, many comparable new jobs have been created through the growth of the retail industry. This fact appears to be true on the surface, but closer examination shows it to be deceiving. Textile jobs pay 63 percent more than retail jobs. While the average mill worker receives wages of $440.59 a week, retail positions pay only $270.90. 
   Furthermore, as an indication of the value of textile sector jobs, one can look at the increase in wages earned by mill workers over the past ten years. The $440.59 figure is up from $308.15 in 1989. 
   In effect, well-paying jobs are being replaced with significantly lower paying jobs. This is a serious problem, particularly when many of these workers provide the only source of income for their families. 
   Considering the difficulties of the domestic textile market, the last thing America needs is to increase the amount of cheap imports coming into our country. Yet this is exactly what S. 1387 does. It provides the perfect loophole for Asian countries to circumvent U.S. import restrictions. 
   With the implementation of the Africa trade bill and the Caribbean Basin initiative, Asian companies will be able to easily conduct illegal textile transshipments from both African and Caribbean nations. Once they build manufacturing plants on the Caribbean islands, their products will be automatically accepted into the U.S. with low duties and no quotas. The restrictions contained in the Africa trade legislation will be subverted in a similar manner. Illegal transshipments already hurt American textile companies, and making them easier will just exacerbate the problem. 
   This decimation of one of America's most important manufacturing sectors is unacceptable. I agree, as most of us do, that increased economic development in Africa and the Caribbean Basin is an important international objective, and is ultimately in America's best interest. Further, it is important that we assist these regions in implementing effective policies for this development. However, to do so at the expense of the textile and apparel industries and the American workers in those industries is irresponsible and foolhardy. 
   The opportunity we are offering to the countries covered by this legislation is enormous. We are allowing them open access to our markets, giving them the opportunity to export their products to the United States at will. Meanwhile, more American workers will lose their jobs because foreign laborers are willing to work for much lower wages. Effectively, we are opening our doors to cheap imports and unemployment, all in the name of helping these poor nations to establish a firmer economic footing. 
   In return for this favor we ask for nothing. We are agreeing to give away our employment and our money, and yet we want nothing in exchange. This is bad economics and poor policy-making. 
   It seems clear to me that we should ask for something in return. We should ask that, at the very least, these nations 
   treat their citizens decently and with respect. The human rights records of the countries included in this trade bill range from marginal to abominable. It should not be too much to expect for their governments to take steps to improve the living conditions of their people. 
   Women suffer unequal and often violent treatment in many of the African countries and Caribbean nations. It is common in these societies to accept physical violence as a means of resolving domestic disputes. The result of this toleration is that women are routinely battered, raped, and assaulted. For example, human rights workers estimate that 20 percent of the female population in Nigeria has been subjected to physical abuse in the home. Furthermore, many African tribes force their female members to undergo rituals of severe violence, which are often life-threatening. In some countries, such as Sierra Leone, such brutal acts have been practiced on almost 100 percent of females. 
   Obviously, these women are considered inferior citizens. That inequality is clear in the labor laws of many of these countries. If they are allowed to work at all, women make far lower wages than their male counterparts. In Kenya, women's average monthly wages were a striking 37 percent below those of men in 1998. 
   Many of the children of these nations suffer similarly dismal fates. Street children, often orphaned by the loss of their parents to the AIDS virus, are sold into prostitution or, in some cases, into slavery. In El Salvador, as many as 270,000 children fit into this category. More ``fortunate'' minors are put to work as street vendors or domestic servants to help support their families financially. Most of these countries maintain the pretense of compulsory education and child labor laws, but few conscientiously enforce them. 
   The plight of unskilled laborers in Africa and the Caribbean is also problematic. Only a handful of the countries covered by S. 1387 have established minimum wages that are sufficient to allow workers to support their families. To state one example, unskilled and agricultural laborers in Burundi are forced to survive on an astonishingly low 35 cents per day! Not surprisingly, this amount has been deemed inadequate for a worker and his family to maintain a decent standard of living. 
   Clearly, the citizens of African and Caribbean countries are being subjected to numerous and often brutal human rights abuses. It is absurd that we are proposing to help these nations economically while turning a blind eye to the violence and inequality that goes on within their borders. If Congress and the administration insist on expanding ``free trade'' and granting open access to our markets to developing states, let us at least make such  action contingent upon the equitable and decent treatment of their people. We have a powerful tool at our disposal, and we would be foolish not to use it. 
   This legislation defies common sense. By passing it, we would further erode our manufacturing base and sacrifice important jobs, while receiving nothing in return. To you who represent farmers, I ask that you join me today in opposing this legislation, just as I and the textile workers have stood with you during the current crisis. To those who represent steel, I remind you that we supported you during your crisis as well. Please stand with me in voting against this proposal. 
   Mr. President, to sum up: 
   The bill decimates the apparel sector. It permits duty-free, quota-free imports from the CBI/Africa when made from United States fabric. 
   It targets import-sensitive sectors by altering the rules for the imports of products from Africa. 
   It provides limited protections for African workers and limited protections for Caribbean workers. 
   Unilateral action requiring that countries benefiting take no real action to obtain the benefits. 
   It provides no protection for the environment. Unlike the NAFTA side agreement, there are no side agreements to protect labor. 
   It undermines the textile and apparel policy adopted as part of GATT. 
   This Congress has no continuity of mind and attention. We passed a 10-year phaseout in the GATT agreement on textile quotas. Now, 5 years into the agreement, we want to cut it out. Investments made on the national policy of a 10-year phaseout are cut short. How do we pay for the machinery? 
   Since we have a limited time, I will bring the issue into focus. This could be called the Fruit of the Loom job flight bill or the campaign finance bill because this proves the efficacy of soft money. 
   I have an article from today, Friday, October 29, from the Washington Post, entitled ``Will Capitol Crusade Bear Fruit? Ailing Underwear Maker Gives Freely as Senate Mulls Tariff Cut.''  
   Fruit of the Loom Inc. is feeling deep pain these days. The company whose name has long been synonymous with underwear has lost money in the last three quarters. Its stock has dropped from $40 in 1997 to below $3 yesterday. 
   So a bill that would eliminate tariffs that it and other companies pay to bring in certain garments from their factories in the Caribbean looks awfully attractive.  
   That is what we will be voting on.  
   On Capitol Hill, the company that industry people simply call Fruit has emerged as a prime promoter of the Senate bill, which is part of the United States' Caribbean Basin Initiative. The company also has become a big contributor to Republican causes. 
   Contribution records show that Fruit gave $350,000 in ``soft money'' to GOP groups, $265,000 of it to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, in the 1997-98 election cycle. That placed the company in the same league as the National Rifle Association and much bigger companies, such as drugmaker Novartis Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. 
   Fruit also gave almost $90,000 in ``soft money to the Democratic cause, all of it to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. 
   Contributions have continued in 1999. Records show an additional $73,000, all of it to Republicans. 
   At the same time, Fruit's chairman, William Farley, has been an active donor to key Republicans, giving $2,000 in May to the group Trent Lott for Mississippi, which supports the Senate majority leader, and $2,000 to the Keep Our Majority Political Action Committee, which supports GOP candidates.  
   Mr. President, we are not dealing with jobs and dealing with trade. We are dealing with campaign finance. 
   I continue:  
   ``It's a company in bad shape giving money fairly lavishly to the [political] process, with incredible things to gain,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity. 
   Fruit doesn't deny the bill would help it--a spokesman said it expects to gain $25 million to $50 million a year if the Senate bill is enacted--but argues it will also help American industry and jobs. 
   ``We don't look on this bill as corporate welfare,'' said Ronald J. Sorini, Fruit senior vice president for government affairs. 
   Sorini said that his company and the industry are ``getting hammered'' by imports from Asia and that the Senate version of the bill, which limits import benefits to clothes made abroad from U.S.-produced textiles, would help the company compete by helping team its U.S. textile workers with its low-cost garment stitchers overseas. The House bill does not require use of American cloth.  
   Mr. President, as an aside, the ATMI disapproves this particular bill because it marries the House bill with the Senate bill and does not require the Senate language. 
   Reading on:  
   He denied the contributions are targeted at the Caribbean bill, saying Fruit has more issues than that to worry about in Congress. ``We support those who generally support our industry,'' he said. 
   The Clinton administration also backs the Senate bill, as does the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, which represents companies that make cloth. 
   The Senate bill, along with one to offer similar tariff benefits to Africa, was caught up in maneuvering last night, with a vote to limit debate set for today. The measure is opposed by a coalition of labor groups and companies that still make garments in the United States. They contend it will further erode U.S. garment jobs and unfairly reward companies like Fruit that have sent garment jobs overseas. 
   Fruit's U.S. employment has fallen from 33,000 to 17,000 people, the company says. About 3,500 Fruit employees are based in Kentucky, and the bill has caused a split between the state's two senators, Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning, both Republicans. 
   McConnell favors it. ``It's not unusual for a senator to support the interests of a major employer in his or her state,'' said Kyle Simmons, his chief of staff. 
   McConnell heads the Republican committee that has been the beneficiary of Fruit's soft-money contributions. Simmons said the money has no connection to McConnell's position, adding that he has always been a ``free-trader.'' 
   Bunning has spoken out against the bill, on the grounds that too many jobs are going abroad. 
   All in all, the bill would cost the Treasury about $1 billion in lost tariff revenue over five years.  
   Mr. President, if there is any pride in being a Senator, they would withdraw this bill. 
   I yield the floor and I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman talked of a short-term political advantage. I have debated this issue for 33 years in the Senate. When I started, I was not successful. We had 90 percent of the production of textiles. We are down to one-third or less of the critical mass. If we preempt the 10-year phaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement, I can tell you right now, the industry is gone. The jobs are gone. 
   He talks about the tyranny of the minority. He has not seen me. If I could be a tyrant, I would be. The White House and an overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats are all in favor of soft money. 
   The morning headline: ``Will Capitol Crusade Bear Fruit?'' ``Ailing Underwear Maker Gives Freely as Senate Mulls Tariff Cut.'' 
   It is not the jobs. The jobs have left Kentucky. Senator BUNNING has to protect the jobs so that no more of them leave. 7,000 have already left Louisiana. The gentleman, Mr. William Farley, has moved his headquarters to the Cayman Islands; so we can call this the Fruit of the Loom job flight bill.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I hope--from the exchange we have just witnessed--that the two wise men will take their trip to Seattle without government gifts. But as they say, the fight will continue. 
   I am not at all sanguine about the recent vote. Be that as it may, it was a majority vote.  
   The Senator from Delaware says he knows--rather he estimated, estimated. The bipartisan majority has just stated what they would like to do, and that is to discuss this further because we are reading in the morning paper exactly what is going on. You know and I know what is going on in this country. The money boys have taken over. 
   For the distinguished Presiding Officer, mark it down. The money boys said this Christian right fundamentalist crowd, Gary Bauer, be gone. Mr. Buchanan, with your abortion, be gone. The rest of you with your fundamentalist stuff, be gone. We have taken over the party, and we are putting $60 million in with George Bush, and the selection process is over. They don't even have to attend the debates. That is what is expected in politics. Otherwise, they have a good friend in the White House--the soft money President, and he is on the money side. I had to fight him with NAFTA. And I am fighting him now, and I will continue to fight and to speak for jobs. 
   Don't give me anything about jobs. How can they talk? It ought to be ashes in their mouths. 
   Since they passed NAFTA promising 200,000 jobs, the textile industry alone has lost 420,000. We know about their promises. We put it in the RECORD. ATMI, and everybody else who said they wouldn't move, they all moved. They have to move. We are the ones who have caused the problem. We put in clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notices, parental leave, and safe machinery. Before you open up your manufacturing you have to comply with the high standard of American living, bipartisan agreement on both sides. Instead, now you can go down to Mexico for 58 cents. Maybe it is up to one dollar in some places. And you don't have to have any of those requirements. 
   If the competition leaves, other companies have to leave to stay in business. 
   They say: Let's spread it to the African nations; we have the ambassadors in town. I have been in Africa. Don't tell me about sympathy for Africa. I lost friends in North Africa during the War who were helping to bring freedom there. We finally helped Mandela get out of prison. We have been the friends of Africa. We traveled there and we helped. 
   If we have so much to give, why don't the other industries give to Africa? The textile industry has given at the store, so to speak. Now we have lost two-thirds of our industry. We have a competitive one-third left, but it is going away. That is why I stand here. 
   It is a dark day. I am reminded of Jesse Jackson, who said keep hope alive. We still have hope as long as we can get the attention of a majority of Republicans and Democrats. Several Republican friends came over and said: I agree with you; I'm going to vote with you. Look at the record. I don't know how many Republicans, but it was a bipartisan vote. They are embarrassed with the Farley escapade. It is a one-way street. 
   Come on, trade is trade. Don't give me this whine and fail stuff. 
   We need not just a new agricultural assistance over there with the special Trade Representative. We need Nancy Reagan to replace Barshefsky--``Just say no.'' That is what we need. We know how to bargain. This is not foreign trade; this is foreign aid. It was good for 50 years to revive the different economies of the world, but it isn't any longer. We are in trouble. This boom they are talking about in the stock market is the information society; it doesn't create the jobs. Farley has already transferred nearly as many jobs offshore as Bill Gates has created with Microsoft. The Time magazine article says Microsoft has created 22,000 jobs. We already shipped off, job-wise, Microsoft. We have gotten rid of it, and we want to give them a $50 million prize for doing it, according to the Washington Post this morning. 
   Talk about a dark day. Maybe someday we will simmer down in this body and forget about the Presidential election and act like Senators--work on the minimum wage, health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights, bankruptcy bill, and other bills we have been trying to bring up. 
   My caucus is meeting now. I know I belong in there to try to protect my rights, but I will object to anything other than the regular order of business. Regular order is my vote. We can keep on moving. Let them vote against the minimum wage. They couldn't care less about the workers; they just want the vote. It is all politics. It is all applesauce, as Will Rogers said. 
   We cannot break the syndrome around here. The media is just pell-mell and fancy-free with the politicians. We got a break this morning. I bless whoever wrote that story and the one in Time magazine because I have been alone in this situation. 
   I am tired of this berating, when we are trying to do the work of the voters and the middle class people of America--the economic strength of this democracy--and the money guys are trying get rid of the middle class. Money is taking over the Republican Party, and now money is taking over the Democratic Party. That is what it is. It is just money. That is all. 
   When we started the leadership council--that crowd, our own friends--I remember it well, it was after the 1984 race. We got together all of the southern Senators, save one. We found out that the trouble was we had too many caucuses. We had the NAACP, the AFL-CIO, the women's caucus, this rights caucus and that rights caucus. So their solution was to form a caucus. They had the arrogance to call them the leadership council. They talked at the caucus yesterday, everybody bowing and scraping. They said: HOLLINGS, you got out of the Presidential race, but you head it up. I said I can't in good faith ask the Democratic Party to be there 
   for me and then, when I get beat, say the trouble is with the party, not me. I supported Paul Kirk, and we worked and stayed in the party. 
   I have never been to a meeting in the leadership thing. I watched the money take over. A lot of what Buchanan said about the parties is right, there is not a dime's worth of difference. You can't get anything here for working America. It is money, money, money. They ought to be ashamed to say I am continuing to fight for this. It would shame me with those contributions. 
   I was looking for the distinguished leader, and I was going to tell him confidentially as a friend: Let the bill die; you don't want to bring it up. I have done you a favor. 
   We were headed with a symbol to the world. I am worried about the country. Don't give me symbols about Seattle and ambassadors in the gallery. We should stay here to do our work. They can make any agreement, but it had better not be unanimous because I object. I expect the regular order. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there is one difficulty we have in this trade debate, it is credibility. If you believe the distinguished leaders, the President, the majority, minority leader, the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee, you are bound to vote for this particular agreement with respect to the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the sub-Sahara. Then if you believe this Senator, who is in a dreadful minority at this point, you couldn't possibly vote for it. 
   Trying to bolster my credibility, because I have spoken throughout the year with respect to the budget, the deficit and whether or not there is a surplus, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD this morning's column entitled ``Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH Research Budget.''

   Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 (which ended Sept. 30), the first time the government has recorded back-to-back surpluses since the Eisenhower administration in 1956-57.   
   That is totally false. Mark Twain said it best: The truth is such a precious thing, it should be used very sparingly. That has been the credo around the Government in Washington, particularly with respect to our fiscal condition. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD table 6 on page 20 of the U.S. Treasury Report, issued yesterday.

You have to do that by Friday, tomorrow, at midnight. I take it we will close down the Government unless we pass another continuing resolution. The U.S. Treasury report shows that at the beginning of this year we had a national debt of $5,478,704,000,000. 
   Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print this table in the RECORD entitled ``Hollings Budget Realities.'' 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. I will show we agree that at the beginning of the year we have exactly that figure, 5 trillion 478 billion 7-some-odd-million dollars. Now, referring to U.S. Treasury Report table, you will find, under the column Close of This Month, the figure $5,606,486,000,000. So the table itself, according to the figures issued yesterday, showed the Federal Government ran a surplus. Absolutely false. This reporter ought to do his work. This crowd never has asked for or kept up with or checked the facts. Eric Planin--all he has to do is not spread rumors or get into the political message. Both Democrats and Republicans are all running this year and next and saying surplus, surplus. Look what we have done. 
   It is false. The actual figures show that from the beginning of the fiscal year until now we had to borrow $127,800,000,000. 
   That is increasing the national debt. That is the deficit, $127 billion. I checked this with the Congressional Budget Office. They haven't done their interpolation of the various records. I had been reporting, as you will find on the table inserted, a $103 billion deficit for this fiscal year, as of the CBO June 30 figure. I said: Wait a minute, it is way more than what we thought, if it is 127 rather than 103. They said there were some unaccounted balances carried forward, some $16 billion. So it might be, instead of 103, 112. Conscientiously, we are trying to give the truth to the American people. 
   We have those figures in this particular table. We can enlarge it for the viewing Senators here. That is exactly what I have said. We have a $5,487,700,000,000 debt. Now it has gone up. Instead of $5,582,000,000,000, it has gone to $5,606,000,000,000. So you can see, when we got to the end of the fiscal year, not the projections, not the guesses, or whatever else--we had a deficit of $127.8 billion. That is going up, up and away, because if you look at the previous year, we did better. Well, we didn't do better in 1997, the previous year, but I should say the deficits have been coming down. And they had projected, for example, next year, a $82 billion deficit coming down from the 127.8 billion. I should say 103 billion, as is shown on this particular chart. 
   Now, if instead of $103 billion deficit, it is going to $127.8 billion, you can see at a glance it is going to be another $100 billion deficit next year. Looking at the facts, you can find the editorial in the Washington Post to show we have already spent 30 billion of the Social Security monies. We are all running around in a circle saying, ``I don't want to touch it. No, I will not touch it.'' They have already touched it to the tune of 30 billion bucks, this Congress, the House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, all of us. 
   We have to get the truth out. Even then, to create a surplus, they are  using these particular figures--we are discussing in another conference ongoing right at the minute--the airport trust fund. We have all kinds of dangers with respect to the airports. It is getting unsafe to fly. We need better radar. We need more runways. We need more airports. We need better controls, better control towers, everything else of that kind. We are being taxed for it. We all fly, and we pay the taxes as airline travelers. 
   But $11 billion has been spent on any and everything other than airports. It shows that it is going up, under the budget, to $23 billion in 2004. We have the money, but we don't spend it on the airports or the highways. Reporters across this country have been writing these editorials to the effect that it doesn't make any difference whether we borrowed from it or not; these are just IOUs. 
   I don't want to be around here in the year 2012 when we don't bring in enough to cover our costs and we are going to have to raise taxes in order to make payments. That crowd in New York working the market, they could care less. They think in quarterly amounts, in the quarter of each year. If you don't do it by the third quarter, out you go. That is the CEO/Wall Street mentality. Ours should be the long-range. You have in the desk drawer right now $1.859 trillion in IOUs not only in Medicare but in military retirement, civilian retirement, and you don't want to talk Social Security. I don't want to touch the military retirement fund or borrow from the unemployment compensation fund, the highways, and the airports. 
   So we just bring that up for a moment of truth in the Senate. I want to show you this because there is another headline story in the paper about a one percent cut across the board, or 1.5 percent. They are looking for a way to cut $5 billion. Now we have the House, the Senate, the leadership, the White House, and we are trying to get out of here in the next 10 days--if we can only agree on how we are going to find $5 billion--either cut $5 billion in spending, or raise $5 billion in taxes, or do whatever we have to do to find a cut across the board. That is $5 billion. 
   Here is what happens. Right now the estimated interest cost is $356 billion. I don't have an updated figure on that. I know since we have had two interest rate increases by Mr. Greenspan this year, it is going to be more than that $356 billion. But going back to when we last balanced the budget, we had a surplus under President Johnson. They don't have to go back to Eisenhower when they kept a different set of books. Under President Johnson, when we were here and we had a surplus, the interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Here, the interest cost on the national debt is $356 billion. If we just held the line and paid for what we got, we would have had, and would have this morning, not $5 billion, we would have $340 billion to increase the airports, to increase Medicare, to save Social Security, to increase defense. We could have a tax cut and we could pay down the debt if we had the $340 billion. 
   The headline ought to read: Last year we increased taxes. Why? We increased the interest costs because we increased the debt. When you increase the debt some $127 billion, you increase your interest costs, which are running right now at a billion dollars a day. You have to pay it. Worse than the regular taxes, such as sales taxes, for which you can get a school, or gasoline tax, for which you can get a highway--we get absolutely nothing for it. 
   Last year, this Government increased taxes, and they are determined to increase taxes today, this year, in the next two weeks--all the time talking about surpluses and about cutting spending, and all the time talking about cutting taxes. 
   Now, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a little difficult to have coherence with respect to this debate. I had hoped we would avoid getting back to Smoot-Hawley and even Hitler. I know Pat Buchanan--one of the enthusiasts for competitive trade--and I think he is right on trade. Unfortunately, he has suggested in his recent book we ought to be more considerate of Hitler. A notion that is pure nonsense. 
   On this issue, the Senator from New York cited Smoot-Hawley, the Depression, and Hitler. If you listen to the gentleman and are not fully aware of all the facts, one would think this is a bill to avoid a depression and avoid ``Hitlerism'' or some other possibility. 
   With respect to Smoot-Hawley, we had a good debate some 15 or more years ago. I will never forget it. The late Senator from Pennsylvania, John Heinz, and myself had to correct that record. We got the Don Bedell Associates study of Smoot-Hawley. 
   The crash occurred in October of 1929. That is when we all went broke. That could easily happen with what is going on right now, if some of the signs we are reading on the horizon come to bear. Not being an alarmist and being a realist, let's look at Smoot-Hawley. 
   First, it occurred some 8 months after the October 29 crash, in June of 1930. It did not cause the crash, Hitler, the Depression, or any of the other disasters of the thirties. On the contrary, it did not affect trade to any extent. The tariffs in question affected only one-third of our trade; two-thirds were unaffected--causing no impact whatsoever with respect to trade. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, continuing with respect to the amount of trade affected, it was just at a third or a little less. Trade itself was somewhere around 1.5 percent. There was some argument about it being 3 percent of the GNP. Now it is 25 percent. 
   I am trying to give a comparison so you get a feel of the exact impact upon the economy. 
   The tariffs in question affected only $231 million worth of products in the second half of 1930--less than 1 percent of the world trade. So it did not have any real effect on world trade. 
   In 1930 to 1932, duty-free imports into the United States dropped at virtually the same percentage as dutiable imports. 
   So what you do is you look at the effect of Smoot-Hawley, and look how unaffected free trade really was mostly due to the worldwide depression. But namely, talking about cause and effect, we are both discussing the effect, but not the cause; because the cause was not Smoot-Hawley. 
   When taken into account, Smoot-Hawley only affected a fraction of the trade. Only 33 percent of the $1.5 billion of U.S. imports was in the dutiable category. The entire impact of Smoot-Hawley has to be focused on the $1.5 billion number which was barely 1.5 percent of our GNP. 
   I have a better authority than any, I think, with respect to Smoot-Hawley. Paul Krugman, in ``The Age of Diminished Expectations,''--I finally found  his quote--and I am quoting from page 64:  
   Although protectionism is usually a bad thing, it is worth pointing out that it isn't as bad as all that. Protectionism does not cost our economy jobs any more than the trade deficit does: U.S. employment is essentially determined by supply, not demand. The claim that protectionism caused the depression is nonsense; the claim that future protectionism will lead to a repeat performance is equally nonsensical.  
   Mr. President, there you are. Any time they get in trouble and they do not have the facts with them, then they go off and try to get you into a miasma of history and how we have had bad times, and now we have good times--the best of times--and how we are going to create all of these jobs. The group that says it is going to create jobs is the same group mentioned in 1993 in Capital City's Media Women's Daily, where the article from November 16 states:  
   That was the battle cry Monday by directors of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, who in a last-ditch effort to solidify congressional support for NAFTA, pledged not to move any jobs to Mexico in the pact as passed. The ATMI Board, made up of firms representing every facet of the textile industry, voted in favor of the resolution which said their companies would not move jobs, plants, or facilities from the United States to Mexico as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement.  
   What are the facts? Dan River is about to build an integrated apparel fabrics manufacturing plant in Mexico. Tarrant Apparel purchased a denim mill in Puebla, Mexico; DuPont and Alpek are going to build a plant in Altimira, Mexico and form a joint venture with Teijin; Guilford and Cone Mills are to create a Mexican industrial park known as ``textile city''; Burlington Industries is going to build a new Mexican plant to produce wool products. 
   I hear about the 127,000 jobs that the industry says it is going to create. I heard that NAFTA was going to create 200,000 jobs. 
   I know categorically from the Department of Labor that we have lost 420,000 textile jobs since NAFTA was introduced. We have lost exactly 31,700 jobs in South Carolina alone. You only have to turn to the articles by Kurt Salmon Associates--and I quote from 
   August of this year:  
   More textile mills are funneling plants and investment into Mexico to be closer to the cut-and-sew apparel factories that have already migrated south of the border, according to a new analysis. A flood of low-priced fabric and fiber imports from Asia has pressured domestic manufacturers to respond by seeking ways to cut their own costs.  
   The Kurt Salmon Associates report continues:  
   Since NAFTA's passage in 1994, Georgia has lost 28,000, plus two textile--30,000 apparel and textile jobs.  
   So we have lost 31,700 jobs. They have lost 30,000. That makes, as you go over through the other States and the other communities, some 420,000 in just textile jobs alone. 
   Rather than a balance of trade that they are talking about--a win-win situation, that the industry is for this, everybody is for it. We heard that cry before, too. It was going to create a positive balance of trade. We were at $5 billion at the time we passed NAFTA, a $5 billion-plus balance of trade. Now we have a negative $17 billion balance of trade with Mexico. 
   So the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As I said before, there is no education in the second kick of a mule. This NAFTA proposition that they are trying to spread to the CBI and the sub-Sahara at the same time, it reminds me of an insurance policy contest that they had for a company down in South Carolina years back. The winning slogan for the particular company was: The Capital Life will surely pay, if the small print on the back don't take it away. 
   Here we extend this to the CBI and then to the sub-Sahara; or to the sub-Sahara and then to CBI--either way. I think it is really going to the CBI; and it is going to be kept there and then taken away from the sub-Sahara. 
   They are not going to invest all the way over into Africa when they all just pell-mell are going down there hand over fist to come into the Caribbean production. 
   I was just referring to Mr. Farley and Fruit of the Loom and how they have already eliminated 17,000 jobs in the Presiding Officer's State of Kentucky. They eliminated another 7,000 jobs in Louisiana. They have moved to the Cayman Islands. So they are foreign companies. It is getting to be where we have to sort of sober up and understand what the real facts are. 
   Trade, reciprocity--that is exactly what he called it--reciprocal trade policy of Cordell Hull back in the 1930s. We had reciprocity. We had a modicum of it even in NAFTA, even though it didn't work. But we had the side agreements on the environment. We had the side agreements for labor. We had reciprocity. We go down the list, and we find out now we are going to do away with all of the particular tariffs with respect to the United States for the CBI, sub-Sahara. 
   Let's see what the CBI--Dominican Republic has a 43-percent tariff; El Salvador--some of these include VAT, a value added tax--El Salvador, 37.5 percent; Honduras, 35 percent--this is all on textiles--Guatemala, 40 percent; Costa Rica, 39 percent; Haiti, 29 percent; Jamaica, 40 percent; Nicaragua, 35 percent; Trinidad and Tobago, 40 percent--the United States is already giving it the store. We have already lowered ours to 10 percent. There is a 5-year phaseout. We have had a 10-year phaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement. Now we are going into the fifth or sixth year, so we only have another 5 years. And the real impacts, the heavy reductions on the good traded articles--we do trade some in textiles--is going right on out of the window. So, yes, you have some fabric boys calling us and saying: Wait a minute, Senator, we are for this bill. That is shortsighted. It is just like all the apparel jobs--about gone. 
   What is happening, as Kurt Salmon Associates says, they want to locate the fabric plants near where the sewing is and where the apparel is. It is just an economy of production, an increase in productivity. So they are moving down there more and more. So the fabric boys are calling on the phone. Give them another 5 years, I can tell you here and now; they will be gone. 
   I know this: Any good businessman in textiles looking at this situation says, with 5 years--wait a minute--to put in this new machinery, this new spindle or otherwise--says: I can't get my money back in 5 years. It is going to take me 9 to 10 years to get my money back. I just don't buy it. I don't get productivity. And then the politicians will run around on the floor of the National Government hollering: They have to be more productive; they have to be more productive. And who has cut off the productivity? We have. 
   What about tariffs in Africa? Central African Republic, 30 percent; Cameroon, 30 percent; Chad, 30 percent; Congo, 30 percent; Ethiopia, 80 percent; Gabon, 30 percent; Ghana, 25 percent; Kenya, 80 percent; Mauritius, 88 percent; Nigeria, 55 percent; Tanzania, 40 percent; Zimbabwe, 200 percent. There they are. 
   What is really going to happen, from practical experience, is transshipments. Let me say a word about the transshipment problem. I will never forget. It was 1984; this Senator got 500 additional customs agents into the Treasury-Post Office appropriations bill, and they didn't hire them. We kept on pleading, and by the end of the 1980s, we finally got President Bush, and he put on some extra ones. But we haven't gotten any extra ones since that time. 
   We go to the customs agents, and they say yes, it is still at least 5 billion in transshipments, but they say: Senator, you want us to stop T-shirts or drugs? And you look them in the face and say: Well, of course you have to stop the drugs. They say: That is all we have got. 
   Now they are talking all over the Halls in both Chambers of a 1 1/2 percent cut. And now we have just been educated by CBO that 
   1 1/2 won't work, it will take at least 5.8 percent. And then if you don't, if you are going to exclude, say, defense and others, emergency ones, it is going to take an 11.8-percent across-the-board cut. So they are debating over on the House side right now is this so-called cut bill. But what they are debating is a cut in customs agents and a cut in enforcement. 
   Our African friends, I know they changed their vote with respect to human rights in the United Nations some 4 years ago or 5 years ago. We had passed a resolution in the general assembly, and we will set up the hearings. We never have had the hearings. 
   Our Chinese friends went down into Africa. They have made all kinds of  friends there over the years. I will never forget over 25 years ago when I was in Zaire, it was the Chinese building the railroad from the hinterland out to the coast, down the Congo. They have had all kinds of contacts down there with Nelson Mandela and many others. They will get their plants and transshipments, and they will be coming through Africa. And our folks will be working still at customs looking for drugs coming up from Colombia and South America and little inspecting will done concerning transshipments in the area of African trade. 
   In reality, you are really fattening the competition in the Pacific rim all under the auspices and the gist of free trade. Let's say we are going to allow our textile boys to compete with the Pacific rim industries. That is why I put in that book. 
   Do we have the book of all the fabric manufacturers? I don't want to put the entire book in, but we included just those entities that had invested already down in Mexico--referring, of course, to Davidson's Textile Blue Book. You can see here the fabric resource list. We will include all of these pages--not the book, but pages 345 through--well, just the fabric--well, we can include the yarns, too, natural fibers; they have yarn forward on 807, 809. 
   That is too much to include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Just on the fabrics, not just the yarns forward, would be 11 pages. 
   As I related on yesterday, all you need do is go from southern California into Tijuana, and you can see that you think you are going into Mexico, but it looks as if you are going into Seoul, Korea. There is nothing but Korean plants all over it. I have been there. I have traveled to other parts of Mexico. I think we ought to say a word, though, with respect to the wonderful economy we have. Do we have that article? 
   I was talking earlier about the economy and the devastating effect this would have on the economic strength, the security, of the United States upon a three-legged stool: One leg of values as a nation is unquestioned; the second leg, that of military and the only superpower left; the third leg of the economics has been fractured. They used the 17-percent figure, but the most recent figure I had of workforce and manufacturing had gone from 26 percent 10 years ago down to 13 percent. What happens is, since we are not saving here, I had the article where we are actually consuming more than our increase in productivity. 
   If you can find that in here--I am not sure that is the same article I was looking at. It was three weeks ago in Newsweek where they pointed that out. Last week, Mort Zuckerman, in U.S. News and World Report, talked about the two levels of society and the split we have there. 
   We see signs on the horizon now of trouble. We are not pessimists, and we are not necessarily optimists; we are realists. As I pointed out earlier, the deficit at the end of last month for the fiscal year 1999 was $127 billion. It is not a surplus--not as they reported in a Washington Post story that was added earlier today to the RECORD--that said for the first time since the Eisenhower days we had back-to-back surpluses. That is absolutely false. It is a $127 billion deficit, according to Treasury figures. They could be interpolated by the CBO about funds carried forward. And it says there might be about $16 billion. 
   When my distinguished friend from New Mexico put this balanced budget law through in 1997, I said: If the budget is balanced under your act, I will jump off the Capitol dome. We knew it would not be. We know now it isn't. When you are still spending $100 billion more than you take in and you are increasing your deficit from last year, as we are going to do already this year, we just go pell-mell down the road. Your interest debt increases, your interest cost increases, and so your spending increases. And they want to give all kinds of tax cuts and spending. 
   I know I am on pretty solid ground. So when the President said--I wish I had that article of yesterday from the Washington Post. It was on page 3 or 4. I want to give some credibility to what I am saying. It is difficult when you are the only one saying there is a deficit. The newspapers say surplus, the President says surplus, the majority leader says surplus, the minority leader says surplus, the Democrats say surplus, the Republicans say surplus; and you come along and say there is a deficit. You have to have support for what you are doing. So I put in this sheet of paper earlier with respect to the Treasury figures. I am glad to put it in again, if I can find a copy of it. I will ask the staff to get a copy of that sheet from the Treasury Department we were inserting into the RECORD so we can see exactly--I am not just saying it is a deficit, it is the Treasury Department saying it is a deficit. So we will find that. 
   Right here in this morning's paper it says we are not spending more money than we are taking in. It is as usual. As Tennessee Ernie said, ``another day older and deeper in debt.'' 
   Can we get Thursday's Washington Post, which is easily had, and the sheet of paper from the Treasury Department? I know they made a copy. Here it is. ``Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH Research Budget.'' The subheadline is ``The government has recorded its first back-to-back surpluses since 1956-57.'' 
   Mr. President, this says:  
   Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 ..... the first time the government has recorded back-to-back surpluses since the Eisenhower administration in 1956-57.  
   Absolutely false. There isn't any question about it. 
   I will retain this floor. I know others like to talk about different subjects, but I have had a difficult time this morning trying to get a word in edgewise about this particular trade bill. 
   If we find the Treasury sheet that was issued yesterday, it is a whole report--I didn't want to put the entire report in the RECORD, but if we can find that sheet, we will include it. It is page 20. 
   I have my hand on another copy right here. This is page 20 of the Department of the Treasury report, table 6: ``Means of financing the deficit or disposition of surplus by the U.S. Government, September 1999, and other periods.'' 
   Then you will see the account balances column, current fiscal year of total Federal securities. In other words, how much did we have to borrow? We have the figure here at the beginning of the year; it is $5,478,704,000,000. Then you look at the close of the fiscal year, and it is $5,606,486,000,000--a deficit, not a surplus, of $127.8 billion. That is as of yesterday. But if you read the headline in the paper, they have ``back-to-back surpluses,'' and we have another deficit in excess of over $100 billion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, having gotten the record made, the point is that it is not as easy as my distinguished colleagues from New York and Delaware, the leaders on this particular measure, have painted it. When you see that you are running deficits now of $127 billion, when you see that the trade deficit is widening, when you see that, according to an article, we were consuming faster than we were producing, then you can see trouble on the horizon. 
   I refer to this morning's Financial Times, page 4: ``Widening Trade Gap Raises Fear For Dollar.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there it says:  
   A slide on the U.S. dollar has haunted global currency markets for several months now.  
   It says:  
   The dollar was granted a reprieve last week following better-than-expected August trade figures. But many observers believe it is only a matter of time before the dollar succumbs to mounting trade imbalances.  
   It is going up over $300 billion.  
   As the U.S. current account deficit has increased, concerns have testified that international appetite for dollar assets will soon be exhausted, leaving the U.S. unable to fund its trade shortfall with the rest of the globe and precipitating a sharp drop in the currency. That could imperil the U.S. economy's run of rapid inflationary growth.  
   It goes on to say how we have had foreign direct investment with, of  course, the BP takeover of Amoco, Daimler-Mercedes takeover of Chrysler, and Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch. 
   It says:  
   The big question for the dollar is whether this surge in foreign, direct investment can be maintained. 
   But the bare facts are alarming. The current account deficit, expanding at over 50 percent a year over the past two years, is now at its highest level since at least the end of the Civil War as a proportion of GDP. And the family silver can only be sold once. Few believe that the U.S. economy can rely indefinitely on the sale of assets to cover the current account shortfall.  
   Some analysts believe that the dollar's 16 percent fall against the yen since this year's peak in May merely marks the start of a period of general weakness in the U.S. currency. 
   What are we doing about this? We are taking away the productivity. It is not an increase in jobs. It isn't any increase at all. They are running and spending it fast in the fabric plants. But forget about the people working by the sweat of their brow in the apparel industry--such as the mother trying to keep food on the table and get her children through college. 
   We will pass all kinds of protections for high tech companies. We even repealed the State tort laws for something that can't happen until the first of next year. They want to do away with the immigration laws for high tech companies--the estate taxes, the capital gains tax, and everything else of that kind. They have all kinds of benefits. I even saw an article about creating a subsidy for boat manufacturers, so we can get more pleasure yachts. 
   We have to increase the productivity. We are losing the industrial backbone of the United States of America. 
   What we are hearing is that this Senator and others do not understand that the high-tech community is the engine of this wonderful globalization, the engine of this economic giant, the United States of America. Not so at all. 
   There is a book called ``In Praise of Hard Industries'' by Eamonn Fingleton. We don't put the book, of course, in the RECORD.  
   But surely the United States has scored some real successes in high-tech manufacturing in the 1990s? Yes--but far fewer than even most experts realize. Perhaps the strongest remaining American high-tech manufacturer is Boeing. But even Boeing is doing less well than it used to. Quite apart from facing increasing competition from the European Airbus consortium, Boeing has been under considerable pressure from foreign governments to transfer jobs abroad, and it has duly done so. As William Greider has pointed out in his book One World, Ready or Not, 30 percent of the components used in Boeing's 777 jet are made abroad. By comparison in the 1960s, Boeing imported only 2 percent of its components. Thus, Boeing, like other erstwhile world-beating American manufacturers, is rapidly becoming a ``virtual corporation'' ever more dependent on suppliers in Japan and elsewhere abroad for its most advanced manufacturing needs.  
   I divert for a minute to say that was the trouble we had in the gulf war. We had to get panel displays from Japan in order to get the weapons in order to fight that war. We weren't making them anymore. Every time I put a ``buy America'' provision into the defense bill--I serve on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--I get no, you are a fruitcake. That is what Mike Kelly calls those who are trying to protect trade. 
   Now I hear this morning that I am going to start a depression and everything else of that kind. You can't talk sense on this particular subject. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. 
   Let me quote again.  
   Meanwhile, despite all the talk of a renaissance in the American semiconductor industry, there is acturally only one truly strong American semiconductor manufacturer left: Intel. Moreover. Intel's success says little if anything about its manufacturing prowess. In fact, the company's twenty-four-fold growth in the fifteen years to 1997 has been driven not by any fundamental efficiency edge in production engineering but rather by the company's near-monopolistic franchise in producing microprocessors for the dominant ``Wintel'' standard in personal computers. 
   In any case, Intel is just one company--and judged by the all-important criterion of jobs, not a particularly large one. At last count it employed sixty-seven thousand people worldwide--little more than one-sixth of IBM's peak workforce in the mid-1980s before its domination of the computer industry collapsed under pressure from the rising Wintel standard. Moreover, Intel is not as advanced as it appears. In fact, its Wintel chips are based on an aging technology known as CISC (complex instruction set computing). In the last decade, CISC has been superseded by a technology called RISC (reduced instruction set computing). RISC chips, which are noted for their use in such high-performance computers as Sun Microsystems' network servers, are made mainly in Japan. 
   Intel apart, there are few other semiconductor manufacturers left in the United States. This may seem surprising in view of the fact that, according to such prophets of America's purported industrial renaissance as Jerry Jasinowski, the United States has now recovered strong leadership in semiconductors. He has reported that American semiconductor makers boosted their global market share from 40 percent in 1988 to 44 percent in 1993, and this supposedly has put the United States back in the ``top spot'' in the industry. After the big decline in America's share in the first half of the 1980s, all this seems like convincing evidence of a comeback. But the truth is that his 44 percent figure is bogus. It is based on highly misleading statistical procedures that categorize most chips outsourced by American companies from factories in East Asia and elsewhere as ``American''! The only justification for this bizarre statistical treatment is that most such chips are made to American designs and bear American brand names. But that hardly means they are made in America. Even Dataquest, an information-industry consulting firm that is the ultimate source of data on world semiconductor production, compiles its statistics on this basis. 
   Given the prevalence of such misleading statistics, how do we gauge the true state of American competitiveness? Again, there is no substitute for international trade figures. These indicate that the United States ran a deficit of more than $3 billion with Japan alone in semiconductors in 1997. Given Japan's higher wage levels, therefore, it is clear that the idea that the United States has recovered world leadership in semiconductors is just another myth.  
   Mr. President, I want to yield in a minute so other colleagues can address the Senate. But I will come back because what you have is a situation where that sandwich board they put up with all of these industries, they are all for the American worker. No; they are all for money, profit. That is all that those companies are for. 
   Let me quote page 32.  
   Since American labor is not represented in American boardrooms, the real losers from technological globalism have no say in the matter. Moreover, workers' interests count for so little these days that American corporate executives openly proclaim their commitment to utopian globalism without the slightest fear of embarrassment. The pattern was memorably exemplified a few years ago by a Colgate-Palmolive executive who told the New York Times: ``The United States does not have an automatic call on our resources. There is no mindset that puts this country first.'' A similarly outspoken disregard for the interests of American labor was apparent in a remark by NCR's president, Gilbert Williamson, some years ago when he said: ``I was asked the other day about the United States' competitiveness, and I replied that I don't think about it at all. We at NCR think of ourselves as a globally competitive company that happens to be incorporated in the United States.''  
   That is the situation with Farley and Fruit of the Loom, exactly what was brought in issue fortuitously by Time magazine when they put in the article ``The Fruit of Its Labor--The Politics of Underwear.'' Fruit of the Loom eliminated 17,000 jobs in Kentucky, 7,000 in Louisiana, moved to the Cayman Islands and I should put them on one of those sandwich boards. Whoopee, they are for this bill so that they can make more money. 
   Who is looking at the welfare of the American worker? Who is looking at the industrial strength of the United States? Who is looking at the economic progress and security of the United States of America? 
   One could not be for this particular bill if one knew how it has been drawn up. It does not even compare with NAFTA. We cannot put an amendment up because the tree is filled. They put in what you might call fast track, no amendments, and then they give their friends the fruit of the tree. Senator WELLSTONE, the Democrat, comes in with an agricultural amendment that is not to be allowed. But take the Senator from Missouri. When he comes with a particular amendment on agriculture, the leader comes down and finds that is relevant. We stop the whole process and pluck the amendment from the tree and put in your friend's amendment and they call that ``procedure'' in the world's most deliberative body. It is the most undemocratic procedure, unparliamentary kind of procedure that could possibly be contemplated. They ought to be embarrassed handling a measure this way. 
   However, there is no embarrassment with this group. They know they can pass this bill easily because they can  breeze through the committee and everybody on the floor saying mollify, unite. It used to be the ILGWU working the floor. I have been in it too long; I understand the competition. 
   As a southern Governor, I don't blame the foreigners for saying we give this benefit and give that benefit. That is exactly what we did in South Carolina. The Senator from Delaware says they can get new jobs by learning new skills. We do that in South Carolina. We have brought in Hoffman-LaRouche and BMW. They told me the only reason they have come is because of the technical training system I instituted 30 years ago. I know about skills, training, getting new jobs and new industry. But we have had a net loss, in the last 4 years since NAFTA, of 12,000 jobs in South Carolina. 
   In the campaign last year in the Governor's race, they were talking about new jobs. I said: Add and subtract. You are not announcing those that are leaving and going down to Mexico. We had United Technologies, the textile plants and others take off down to Mexico. We saw it starting then and it is mushrooming now. 
   We are being derided on the floor talking about Smoot-Hawley and putting up the bankers' sandwich board and saying: This is for the good of America. 
   We are going to have to discuss this a little bit longer. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the stand the distinguished leader takes is one of a fundamental nature. It is one of principle and not politics, and I am in the best position to comment upon it, for the simple reason, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota favors the Finance Committee bill. He would favor throttling me and getting rid of me and having a quick vote. But he understands, better than any, there is more to the Senate than a gymnasium for political gymnastics whereby, on parliamentary positions, you can just cut everybody off. 
   I cannot see Senator Mansfield for a second going along with this nonsense. I could not see for a second Senator Dirksen even suggesting it. There has always been an unwritten rule of comity and understanding and friendship and the strength of feeling. Sometimes, when Senators have that feeling, it is respected by the other 99 Senators. 
   Here, the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, has 
   been very eloquent on the position taken as a matter of principle. His politics are otherwise. He could go along with Senator LOTT and say: The dickens with it, fill up the tree, tomorrow we'll vote, we'll have cloture, and this bill will be over with, and everything else of that kind. 
   But the opposite is the case. He has taken a stand for the Senate majority and minority. It is a Senate stand. I commend him for taking it.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I think now is the time that a record should be made that this isn't a question of consuming time in the sense the majority leader wants to move in an expeditious fashion to the legislation. He doesn't want to hear it, and he doesn't want anybody else to discuss these items. Let's look at the facts.  
   This bill was called on Friday and we had a motion to proceed since everybody was leaving town. I wanted to discuss it and wanted to have someone to talk to. I objected to the motion to proceed. I guess it was a week ago Thursday night when they discussed and voted on other matters on Friday. It was set again for Monday's discussion, but then we lost our wonderful colleague, Senator Chafee. In respect to him, we didn't debate anything. Instead we all expressed our sympathy and deep sense of individual loss of such a wonderful colleague, who was so considerate and so moderate in the sense of listening to both sides, and willing to discuss issues. On Tuesday, we made opening statements again--Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator ROTH and myself. I had to leave, but it was thoroughly discussed all day Tuesday. On Wednesday, I was prepared, having returned early in the morning. I had to testify before a council meeting back in my own hometown on Tuesday evening. But I was back here early.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right. What happens is, on Wednesday morning, we didn't have the side agreements about NAFTA. 
   We were being told this was good because of NAFTA and that NAFTA worked--at least NAFTA had side agreements on environment, labor, reciprocity, and otherwise. Even though I was gone, my staff worked on the legislation. 
   When I took the floor on Wednesday morning, I was not recognized to have the floor. I said I just wanted to discuss these amendments but the Senate was conducting a quorum call. The leadership waited for an hour and a half for the leader to come and did not allow any discussion. I had gotten up twice and they would not even give me consent to talk about the amendments, which is really what I had to mind. 
   Then the leader comes in and he so-called filled up the tree, but really he put it on the fast track. Namely, I could not, or you could not, or anybody on this side of the aisle could not offer an amendment. Now, on the other side of the aisle, the Senator from Illinois can get his amendment in at the committee hearing. He can get his amendment in when the leader puts down the managers' amendment. He can get that taken care of there. Or you can do as Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri did. He got the leader to call down the last amendment, come to the floor and put up his agricultural amendment and, in the same breath, say the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota is irrelevant. That is how gauche, arrogant, and unsenatorial this thing is. I never heard of such a thing. They just lock you out and say, as has been pointed out, we filled up the tree, and only Members on that side of the aisle can enjoy the fruits of the tree. 
   Here we are. So don't have the majority leader come back and have the audacity to say these are important matters; you all want to filibuster. He is the one. I told him, up or down, I would take five minutes to a side on amendments and we will have a roll call. He doesn't want to have this subject up. 
   We ought to have Members on that side have at least the courage to get up and say, wait a minute, these are important subjects. I would think somebody on the other side of the aisle would like to talk about the minimum wage. They say 83 percent of the people of America favor it. We know what the situation is. Yet they won't even broach the subject. They don't want the subject to come up. All we are hearing when the leader comes is this is a tough job and these are the things we have to do, and I would be glad to take two or three amendments. I said, wait a minute. I would be glad to offer two amendments right now, with five minutes to a side, and have a vote, or have 20 minutes to a half hour of discussion and then vote, and we will be through with it. 
   Instead of doing that, it is a closeout of discussing important subjects for the American people. From Friday of last week until tonight, Thursday night, the majority was absolutely opposed to you getting the floor whatsoever to discuss it. All of these subjects--Social Security, education measures, the Patients' Bill of Rights, health matters--the majority said was irrevelant. We are going to try and complete our spending bills and try our dead level best to do it without using Social Security. This comes at the very same time that even their own Congressional Budget Office says Congress has already spent $18 billion of Social Security monies.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I remember it very vividly. The truth is that I finally said: Let's cut out the charade. Let's go to Social Security itself. So, I asked the Administrator of Social Security: You folks write the bill so that rather than using Social Security monies for IOUs and the debt, we put it up in a lockbox. I want to make sure it is a truly, honest-to-goodness lockbox. 
   So he wrote the measure, and I introduced it back in January. It went to the Budget Committee, on which I serve. I asked for a hearing but couldn't get one. They do not want to hear about a true lockbox.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Not at all. That is what we ought to emphasize. It isn't a matter of time and holding the process up or any of those kind of things. It is that these important subjects will not be touched upon politically because all that is being done is geared toward the next election, the polls, and everything else of that kind. The majority doesn't want to make unpopular votes. So you are protected with this arrogant kind  of thing of filling up the tree, instituting fast track, and blocking amendments except those checked through the Majority Leader's office. And I hope this is publicized. I hope they have a conscience and will quit this nonsense so we can save time, discuss the subjects, vote up or down, and move on like an orderly body.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I obtain the floor in order to thank my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator FITZGERALD. He is a banker, a financier. He is far more experienced in financial affairs than I, and he is on the other side of the aisle. His arrival now makes it bipartisan and I am very grateful to him. We had a bipartisan move with Senator Heinz and myself in passing section 13.301 of the Budget Act, which says you could not use Social Security--either the Congress or the President--in reporting a budget. That was approved by 98 Senators in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Yet the budgeters continue to ignore it. So I have been looking, since we lost Senator Heinz on that side of the aisle, for some assistance. We had otherwise the leadership of Senator Armstrong and Senator Boschwitz. We were in the extreme in 1989, for supporting a value-added tax, a 5-percent value-added tax, allocated to reducing the deficit and the national debt so we would not spend Social Security. In fact, we had eight votes in the Senate Budget Committee. We recommended again another VAT. We tried to pass other laws. But with respect to the distinguished Senator's statement that the Democrats have voted against Social Security several times, let me clarify that observation of his to the extent that we, right now, are in that same situation. Here now, the tree is filled up. You have veritably fast track; namely, you have a bill out from the committee with a substitute or leader's amendment or maybe they want to call it the amendment of the committee itself. But whatever they call it, it is the committee bill and you cannot amend it. 
   When the tree is filled up that way on cloture, it will be difficult to get cloture because no one is allowed to offer amendments. We need someone to understand this and allow us to begin deliberating. Now, that is what we have. If this persists through tomorrow, I am hopeful, but I don't know because I am a minority of a minority of a minority here, that we can move forward. But it could very well occur that we may not get cloture tomorrow morning at 9:30, if that is when they call the vote. They said they didn't think there are any votes tonight, other than a continuing resolution, which we can voice vote. We may, but I doubt if we could get that vote. 
   So the reason you don't vote cloture is because you want to try to get some amendments considered to discuss these issues. That was the situation each time they brought up that Social Security. I know better than any because I put in my amendment at the very beginning of the year, drawn, if you please, by the Social Security Administrator himself. We introduced it. It was referred under the rules, of course, of the Budget Committee. I have been on that Budget Committee since they started it as a Budget Committee in 1974, some 25 years. So I have been there. I have been chairman of the Budget Committee. I thought I could get a 
   hearing. They don't want to talk about a true lockbox or taking it off budget. They will vote for a sense of the Senate. Then they will vote for the law and then totally ignore the law. And if you can put in my amendment in, as we have it propounded now in the Budget Committee, I can tell you here and now we really will have lockbox, and you won't be able to touch it. 
   We won't have to debate whether or not we are. Everyone could see and understand it. That situation happened several times, and the majority was going to call it the lockbox. One proposal was made by the majority leader that allowed three amendments. We would bring it up, have three amendments considered with time agreements, and then vote. 
   When they found out about my one amendment that was for a true lockbox that is in the Budget Committee, which they won't even give you a hearing on, they would not agree. We had to go ahead and vote against cloture. The distinguished Senator from Illinois calls that a vote against Social Security. Not at all. That is a vote, really, for Social Security. 
   Tomorrow, when a substantial number vote, let's say, assuming against cloture, someone could say they voted against the trade bill. Not at all. They are for the trade bill. The distinguished minority leader has made that clear. The Senator from South Dakota is for this bill, but he is trying to protect the rights of Senators on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. The Senator from Illinois was mistaken to characterize that as a vote against Social Security several times, saying, ``Why did you vote against it if you are sincere?'' We are sincere all right, to try to preserve Social Security. 
   I was one of them and I will go immediately now to the observation made by my distinguished ranking member on the Finance Committee about 90 votes to proceed. I was one of those 90. That doesn't mean you can pass the bill without even considering any amendments. When I voted to proceed, I voted to do just that--proceed to debate the amendments, vote upon them, and get to a final enactment thereof. I have several things that we want to bring up. I see other Members present. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN. He knows this particular subject intimately. He is an expert in the field. He is right on target on the broad observation that it is very unfortunate we cannot debate trade--just generally speaking. 
   I am going to make a few comments in just a little while with respect to  the overall idea that the software industry, computerization and otherwise, is the engine, this is the engine that has gotten America this wonderful boom of its economy. It has for the stock market, but not necessarily for the strength of the economy. We will have to get into that. 
   There are a few loose ends. Just recently, for example, the distinguished Senator from New York, as I understood it, questioned the matter of jobs and the statistics used. So I have the statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, dated October 15, at 12:05. We have lost 17,700 textile jobs and 13,500 apparel jobs, for a total of textile and apparel jobs lost in South Carolina of 31,200, and a national loss of 424,000. That is the authority for the statistics, the facts I have been using. 
   Further, I have heard the debate. I want to be sure that it does not slip my memory. The distinguished Senator from Delaware came up a moment ago, the chairman of our committee, and said: ``Really, the reason for the loss of jobs is high tariffs. That is why they go to get the protection of high tariffs.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have made that point. With NAFTA, we at least eliminated the tariffs. We had the side agreements on labor and environment, we had reciprocities, and we cut down on the tariffs. But here we have no reciprocity. There is no tariff elimination. According to the argument propounded by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, since Zimbabwe has a 200-percent tariff, all of the textile industry should move there immediately, under his reasoning. 
   The truth is, with the elimination of the tariffs, the opposite is true. With the elimination of the tariffs the investment has gone south. That sucking sound, as Ross Perot talked about, I can hear it. They can't hear it but I have heard it, 31,200 textile and apparel jobs in my State since NAFTA. I continue to hear the sound. I want to emphasize that. 
   Further, the statement was made by the distinguished Senator from Iowa that we had a 50-year history of removing barriers. Ha. Not at all. Not at all. We have had a 50-year history of removing our barriers, using foreign trade as foreign aid. But take textiles alone--we have the book. This is ``Foreign Regulations Affecting U.S. Textile and Apparel Exports''; from 1994. 
   Maybe it is on account of me because I used to use this book. Over at Commerce they are not putting it out, but you can get the individual countries and make up an even bigger book--because it has gone up. It has not gone down. They said ``50 years of liberal trade policies eliminating or reducing tariffs.'' The war was over in 1945. To 1995 would be 50 years; to 1994, 49 years. That is 49 years of not reducing foreign textile tariffs and not reducing all the other tariffs and nontariff barriers. 
   You cannot get in and do business, still, in Japan. If you want to sell textiles or do anything about textiles in Korea, you have to get a vote of the industry. Everybody knows Korea have used the Japanese system of controlled capitalism, and it works. That was the American system under Alexander Hamilton. We point out time and again to the Brits, once we won our freedom in the earliest days--David Ricardo, the doctrine of comparative advantage; Adam Smith, open markets, let's go right now. The Brits corresponded with Hamilton saying: You fledgling colony, now that you have won your freedom, let's trade back to the mother country with what you produce best and we will trade back with you what we produce best. 
   Hamilton said in a book ``Reports On Manufacturers''--bug off. He said: We are not going to remain your colony. 
   The second bill that passed this Congress, from which I stand here this evening, on July 4, 1789--the first bill being, of course, the Seal of the United States--the second bill on the 4th of July, 1789, a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 articles. We started and built this economic giant with controlled capitalism, with protectionism. It is emulated--and I do not blame them, it has worked--in Japan. 
   It is not about being fair. These American politicians whine: You have to be fair, be fair. 
   Come on. You have to be realistic. Trade is trade--a fair price for a sound article. It is not a giveaway. Japan is working. Its system is working. 
   All these articles have been written. That is why I want everybody to read Eamonn Fingleton's ``Hard Industry.'' I cannot put the whole book in the RECORD, but I will make reference to it in a minute. 
   Japan, with 125 million citizens and the United States with 260 million citizens, still outproduces us. They are outproducing us. They have a stronger economy. They have a better savings rate. There may be one or two banks bankrupt, but a lot of them did not go bankrupt. They readjusted. They continued to take over market share. 
   This past year, they have taken over, again, more of the American automobile industry than the American manufacturers. It is working. If I were there, I would run it the same way. I would not run away saying they are being unfair. We are being downright stupid. 
   The Senator from North Dakota pointed out the observation of Will Rogers: We win every war but lose every conference because we run around like we are fat, rich, and happy. That is exactly what we heard from the Senator from Delaware, that we have this booming economy. Not so. We have a $300 billion deficit in the balance of trade and we increased the debt again at the end of the fiscal year. We spent $127 billion more than we took in and one important economic indicator--the consumer confidence index--is falling. Chairman Greenspan is raising interest rates, and our nation has lost textile jobs to the extent that two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is represented in imports. I am fighting today to maintain the one-third. 
   This industry is very productive and very competitive but cannot remain so if this bill passes. Within a 5-year period, we are going to have enough problems with respect to the phasing out of the Multifiber Arrangement. So we have to batten down the hatches now and stop putting in these giveaway programs to the Caribbean and to the sub-Sahara on the basis of helping the Caribbean and the sub-Sahara people. 
   I wanted to put in the book of foreign firms located in Mexico in the fabric field. They said it was too many pages. The reason I wanted to do that, of course, is the fabric field abandoned the apparel industry. Now that industry is locating jobs out of the U.S. and that sucking sound of jobs you hear I am trying to prevent from becoming a roar. 
   Maybe they are listening because I received a letter from ATMI. I had not seen this letter. It is dated October 1, 1999. There are two dates. September 28, 1999:  
   Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, I would like to share our views regarding the Caribbean Basin [Initiative] and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act that was approved by the Senate Finance Committee ..... and to express, for the record, our position on any trade package that might include the measures.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. I do not want to mislead or misquote. They say they are for the CBI part of the bill. I quote from the letter in the third paragraph:  
   ATMI cannot, however, support Senate passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act in any form as a stand-alone bill or as part of a trade package because of the dangers posed by a conference with the House. While S. 1387 includes critical U.S. yarn and fiber requirements, the House-passed Africa bill will promote massive illegal transshipments of Asian and apparel products through the 48 nations of sub-Sahara Africa to gain duty-free, quota-free access to the U.S. market. The result will be that billions of dollars of illegal Asian particularly Chinese transshipments will enter the U.S. at zero duty resulting in job losses for thousands of workers, many of whom are African American, in the U.S. textile apparel and fiber industries. 
   The House Africa bill is so fatally flawed that any compromise, other than the bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee, would be extremely harmful to our industry. Therefore, without firm assurance that the Senate Finance Committee's African bill will be maintained in conference without change, we remain opposed to any package containing the African bill even if they were to also include the Finance Committee's yarn forward 807A/809 CBI bill.  
   That would have saved me days in this debate because we are using the same authority. I wish we could have the sandwich board back up. They were saying the ATMI, representing all of the textile industry, will support my position. 
   Let's say they oppose half of my position; namely, the CBI. I at least have support from my own ATMI for the position I have taken. I am beginning to feel a little strength this afternoon where we are picking up a little speed. Maybe I can get the Senator from Florida to support me. I am going to try my best because I want everyone to understand just exactly what was being talked about by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota with respect to the overall trade. 
   We are finding out with respect to agriculture, where I think it would almost be an embarrassment to ask for another subsidy for agriculture--I support agriculture. Everybody knows it. But we have to be up front and lay it on the line. 
   We have magnificent agriculture, not on account of market forces but on account of Government forces. They are  saying market forces, free market. They always give me that when I bring up my textile bill, and they have, what? The land itself. 
   We had our friend--Sen. Dale Bumpers--the Senator from Arkansas, talk about the leases ranchers can get for grazing lands to get their wool. 
   I understand the distinguished ABC announcer who lives in New Mexico has a mohair subsidy. I know the telephone is subsidized with the co-ops. Electricity is subsidized. 
   These producers have been getting price supports. They get export promotion, trade promotion, and everything else like that. If it rains they get help. If it dries up, they get a drought, they get help. 
   With durum wheat and these so-called free trade market forces, we have had an amendment introduced on this particular bill for trade adjustment assistance. 
   So you can see the article by Mort Zuckerman of October 18 in U.S. News & World Report states:  
   We are becoming two nations. The prosperous are rapidly getting more prosperous and the poor are slowly getting poorer. George W. Bush did well to rebuke his party when House Republicans maneuvered to balance the budget by proposing to delay the earned income tax credit for the working poor--paying it in monthly installments rather than an annual lump sum. ``I don't think they ought to balance the budget on the backs of the poor,'' Bush said. Instead, it is time for aspiring leaders to ponder how the two nations might more closely become one. 
   The American economy is growing dramatically. But this prosperity is being distributed very unevenly. The America that is doing well is doing very well indeed. But most benefits have gone to those who work in industries where the main product is information. The losers have been the producers of tangible goods and personal services--even teachers and health care providers. The high-tech information economy has been growing at approximately 10 times the rate of the older industrial economy. It has enjoyed substantial job growth, the highest productivity gains (about 30 percent a year), and bigger profits. It can therefore afford bigger wage gains (about four times that of the older economy). And this wage gap is likely to widen for years to come. 
   The rich get richer. The concentration of wealth is even more dramatic. New York University economist Edward Wolff points out that the top 20 percent of Americans account for more than 100 percent of the total growth in wealth from 1983 to 1997 while the bottom 80 percent lost 7 percent. Another study found that the top 1 percent saw their after-tax income jump 115 percent in the past 22 years. The top fifth have seen an after-tax increase of 43 percent during the same period while the bottom fifth of all Americans--including many working mothers--have seen their after-tax incomes fall 9 percent. The result is that 4 out of 5 households--some 217 million people--will take home a thinner slice of the economic pie than they did 22 years ago.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I emphasize:  
   The top fifth have seen an after-tax increase of 43 percent during the same period, while the bottom fifth of all Americans--including many working mothers--have seen their after-tax incomes fall 9 percent.  
   Fall 9 percent? Disappear. That is the issue in the bill before us. That is why the Senator from South Carolina takes the floor, because they are going to disappear. You have seen exactly what causes that disappearance. It is so-called free trade, free trade--the CBI. We are all for liberal free trade. 
   We can sit around, as politicians, and we can wonderfully agree, in a bipartisan fashion, on this high standard of living. Before you can open up X manufacturing, you have to have clean air, clean water, minimum wage, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave--all of these ramifications of the high standard of living that Republicans support, that Democrats support. But then when you open it up, without protection of your economic strength--your industrial backbone--you begin to hollow it out, and see free trade, free trade, you can go, for 58 cents an hour, down to--someone used the figure 82 cents an hour--to Mexico with none of those requirements. 
   I went down to Mexico. I crossed into Tijuana. And the mayor saw me. He said: Senator, I want you to meet with 12 people. I said: Well, yes. I am down here, and you have been nice enough to come out. I will be glad to. 
   I was looking at all the different industries, of course, and talking to the industrialists themselves, not politicians. But the mayor was very courteous, so I met with them in a little grouping. And in a short word, what happened was--this is about 4 years ago--they had a heavy rain at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year. And it flooded and washed down these little hovels. 
   There are 100,000 people out in this valley of hard dirt. For a place to live, they take five garage doors and put them together. There are no streets. There are no power lines. There is a little electric wire, but that isn't sufficient other than to hold a light. It cannot run the TV. They have a battery to  operate the TV. It is a terrible, miserable existence. But they are proud people, and they work, and they try to get their children to school. 
   So when the rain fell, they all got bogged down--they missed a day of work. So they went to the plant the next day, trying to hold on to their garage door housing, and they found out, under the work rules in Mexico, they were going to be docked another 3 days. So they lost 4 days' pay. That sort of got them a little discouraged with this plant that had moved down from California making these plastic coat hangers. 
   A month passed in February. These workers did not have any protection whatsoever on the inside with the manufacturing--as we talk about with safe machinery and a safe working place--and something broke and flew into a worker's eye, which he lost. Then the workers became more concerned. 
   But on May 1, they had a favorite supervisor. She was expecting. She went to the front office and said: I'm sorry, I'm not doing well. I'm sick. I'm going to have to go home. They said: No, you're not. You stay in here and work or else you are not going to have a job. So she stayed, worked, and miscarried. 
   Then the employees said: We are going up to California, and we are going to get a union. You know what they did? They went up there and got a lawyer in Los Angeles and found out that they had a union. 
   These maquiladora owners are clever enough. When they move down, they fill out the papers, saying that they have a union. And the papers are there but the workers never see a shop steward. They never saw a union man, or anybody else around the plant; never met them. No one was ever there. But they swap monies amongst themselves to try to make it look official. 
   Mexican law says if you have a union and try to organize one, you lose your job. And the 12 I was talking to with the mayor were fired. They could not make a living anymore, could not get a job. 
   You wonder why illegal immigration is so high--I would have bugged out of that country, too. I would have sneaked into the United States or some other country, I can tell you now, to feed my family. 
   That is the kind of work conditions that we try to prevent here in the U.S., which still persist in Mexico. These are the kind of side agreements that we had to try to prevent within NAFTA. 
   So we did that, and we don't have that at all with respect to the different companies down there, let's say, in El Salvador. I won't get into every one of them.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recognize an outstanding South Carolina athlete, Camie Ogren. In August, Camie brought home gold medals in the tricks event, the jump event and the team overall competition in the 1999 World Disabled Water Ski Championships in Windsor, England. This was her fifth trip to the international competition representing the U.S. Disabled Water Ski Team. In 1998, Camie broke the women's world record for slalom at the National Disabled Championships in Birmingham, Ala., where she also won four gold medals in the leg amputee division. 
   Skiing has been an important part of Camie's life since her childhood in Windermere, Florida near Orlando, and in the finest athletic spirit, she continued to pursue the sport after bone cancer claimed her right leg more than 10 years ago when she was 15. Two weeks after her leg was amputated, Camie was back in the water and a few months later she competed in her first world championship in Australia where she earned second and third place honors. 
   She moved to Charleston, S.C. a year and a half ago to work with the Medical University of South Carolina's Anchors Away program. Operated through the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Anchors Away allows people with disabilities and their families access to boats and other recreational activities, mostly on the water. With her expertise, Camie helped Anchors Away form a disabled water ski team that competes in national competitions and has also conducted out-of-town ski clinics in South and North Carolina.  
   Camie is a remarkable person and athlete whose warmth and dedication to the sport of water-skiing has endeared her to the Charleston community. She serves as a powerful example to persons with disabilities of what they can achieve in the realm of competition. South Carolina is lucky to have Camie Ogren and her limitless energy in advancing her sport and its athletes.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York. I have been trying to get the floor. I tried earlier today to be recognized to speak on this bill. It was the objection I had made, of course, to the motion to proceed, due to the strong feelings I had with respect to trade. Incidentally, on yesterday, I could not be present. Amongst others, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota more or less carried the day. I am obligated to him. Senator WELLSTONE did an outstanding job. He asked that, if I could ever get the floor --and I tried twice this morning and could not get the floor--to please ask unanimous consent that he be recognized when I had completed my remarks. I have talked to fellow Senators and there is objection to that. I wanted to let him know that I remembered the promise made. I am not making the request because I know it will be objected to. 
   That brings us right to the unsenatorial, more or less, procedures into which we have bogged down by. In a line, the distinguished majority leader says what we ought to have had was fast track and, within a breath, he gives us fast track. We have fast track on this bill. You cannot put up an amendment. He ``filled up the tree,'' and he says, ``oh, but I am so considerate that I will be glad to help you out if I can give you permission to give you relevant amendments.'' Of course, he decides what is relevant. 
   What about relevance with respect to the Finance Committee? What they are calling a trade bill is actually a foreign aid bill, because you have the Secretary of State calling around on the bill, not the Secretary of Labor for jobs--I don't think she had the gall to do it. But the Secretary of State, with pride, is calling the various Senators because this is a foreign aid bill. It is a one-way street. It is unilateral. It does not have the labor side agreements. It does not have the environmental side agreements that were included in NAFTA. It does not include the reciprocity that we got from the Mexicans when we passed NAFTA. I have prepared amendments that would be relevant, but you can't tell around here. I don't think that I should have to stand as a Senator and beg another Senator permission to put up an amendment. That is the most arrogance I have ever seen since I have been here, some 33 years. It has gotten really raw in this particular body, when you try to debate the most important subject that you can possibly imagine, which is hollowing out not only our industrial strength, but the middle class of our society and the strength of our democracy, and you have to beg to put up an amendment in order to satisfy what the majority leader says what is relevant. 
   Could it be the minimum wage amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts has been trying to get up since the beginning of the year? Well, it is not for Africa, not for the Caribbean Basin Initiative, but more for the workers of America. I say why not? Don't we have trade adjustment assistance in the bill? If that is relevant so is minimum wage. Doesn't minimum wage have relevance to the welfare, the pay, the being of American workers? 
   The question in my mind is what rules are we under? I presided for 6 years under Heinz's precedent. I presided for 4 years under Jefferson's rule. When I got to the Senate, we threw away the rule book because it is whatever the majority leader says. That is the rule. That is what happens up here--we all understand that--in order to facilitate legislation. But when it gets to this point of arrogance it is totally counterproductive. Here you have been trying to get up the bill all year long, and then you put it up in the last few days and say we are all trying to get out of town, let's not have any debate, let's take it or leave it as the Finance Committee has it, and thereupon, let's have cloture, let's have fast track. 
   Well, with respect to the minimum wage amendment, I would gladly put it up. I understood today--and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts can speak for himself--but I talked to him the day before yesterday and advised him that if he didn't, I would, because I think it is just as important as trade adjustment assistance. 
   I see that the distinguished Senator from Texas is on the floor. I understood he said this would create 400,000 jobs. That's very peculiar because I understood the distinguished Senator from New York indicating that we are going to have to put 200,000 on trade adjustment assistance--in other words, we are going to put them out of a job, we are going to give them welfare. What a wonderful thing it is; we started it some 37 years ago. Has this body got any idea what is going on? Are we really creating jobs, or are we decimating the jobs? One brags that we put them on; the other brags that we put them out. And there we are, with respect to relevant amendments.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I don't know whether the distinguished majority leader would agree that this is a special interest bill, but the public domain thinks it is a special interest bill. The leading news magazine in the world thinks it is a special interest bill. Therefore, campaign finance reform would be relevant. 
   Why do I say that? 
   ``The Fruit of Its Labor.'' 
   It is on page 50. 
   ``How a company that exports jobs pushes for a Capitol Hill handout.'' 
   ``The politics of underwear.'' 
   I quote:  
   If you are an underwear mogul, you surely cannot lack confidence. So it is with Bill Farley. The handsome physical-fitness buff has under his belt brands like BVD, Munsingwear and his flagship, Fruit of the Loom. He rubs shoulders with the rich and powerful, and recently co-chaired a lunch that raised more than $500,000 for George W. Bush. Muscles rippling, Farley, 57, has also shown up wearing a tank top in Fruit of the Loom advertising. He once even put himself forward as a candidate for President of the United States.  
   Maybe that is where Trump got the idea. I always wondered where that rascal could think he could be President. 
   But, in any event, reading on:  
   These days, however, Farley's political focus is squarely on Congress, where Fruit's adventures in lobbying offer a choice example of how the game is played. Fruit of the Loom is a tattered company, suffering from bad performance and poor management and lobbying heavily for a bill that would ripen its bottom line. 
   How likely is it that the company's case will be heard on the Hill? Well, last year alone Fruit handed out more than $435,000 in soft-money donations, a figure that puts contributions by the firm (1998 sales: $2.2 billion) ahead of those of such giants as Coca-Cola, Exxon and Bank of America. Most of Fruit's plums go to Republicans, including $265,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, run by Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the principal opponent of campaign finance reform. 
   This week, with Congress having for now killed campaign finance reform, McConnell and other Republicans will get on with other business, such as an amendment to an African trade bill that would allow apparel produced in the Caribbean Basin to enter the U.S. duty free, provided it is assembled from U.S. fabric. 
   Fruit's lobbyists--along with those from competitors like the Sara Lee Crop., which makes Hanes underwear, and retailers like the Limited and the Gap--are pushing hard for passage. Fruit officials claim the measure, which Bill Clinton supports, will create jobs, and deny that the company's donations can buy influence. Says Ron Sorini, a Fruit lobbyist: ``There's absolutely no correlation between our soft-money donations and those who decide to vote in favor of this bill.'' 
   Whether there is or not, Farley's much coveted tariff break comes at a cost. Eliminating duties on apparel from the Caribbean will run U.S. taxpayers at least $1 billion in lost revenue over five years--a figure that, by congressional rules, must be made up with cuts in our programs. 
   Fruit confirms that the bill is expected to deliver a quick $25 million to $50 million to the bottom line, adding to savings achieved after moving some 17,000 of its U.S.-based jobs, mostly to the low-wage Caribbean Basin, and reincorporating in the tax haven Cayman Islands. The jobs cuts were spread across the South, especially Kentucky, where earlier in this decade Fruit was one of the largest employers. ``They are trying to win in Washington what they've been unable to achieve in the marketplace,'' says Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group. ``They're now trying to secure advantages from Congress at a time when they're in dire financial straits.'' 
   Dire is right. After a major inventory snafu, Fruit's financial elastic stretched again last month, when it had to make a $45 million interest payment on accumulated debt of $1.3 billion. Its stock, traded at $48 a few years ago, now sells for less than $4. The board, its confidence in Farley shaken, managed to shunt him into the role of nonexecutive chairman in August, and the company is searching for a new CEO. Farley retains a role in large measure because he still controls 28.5% of Fruit's voting shares. He has also arranged for the company to guarantee loans to himself worth $65 million. 
   Fruit of the Loom's favorite trade bill has led to a rare split between Kentucky's two conservative Republican Senators. While McConnell is expected to support the tariff cut, his colleague Jim Bunning has no intention of backing the measure. Asks Bunning: ``How many more jobs do we have to lose until we wake up and smell the Caribbean coffee?'' 
   Yet for Bill Farley, the aroma is nothing if not enticing. By one count, he's tried to get versions of the bill through Congress six times in recent years. Perhaps seven's the charm.  
   Mr. President, I ask the same question as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. BUNNING. How many more jobs do we have to lose until we wake up and smell the Caribbean coffee? Is there any question in anybody's mind? As we used to say in the law, any reasonable and prudent man--and now woman--can see that this is not a special interest bill. And with campaign finance reform, which is mentioned in this article and which is mentioned in this particular bill, it would be relevant--not under the majority leader's rule of relevancy. 
   Ask the majority leader when he comes to the floor. I can offer the campaign finance reform, or I can offer the minimum wage. Then we will all agree to move right along and vote on the amendment. I will agree to a time agreement. We are not holding anybody up. We can vote both of those amendments this afternoon. We don't have to worry about cloture on Friday. We are ready to roll. We, like the majority leader, want to get out of town. We have a lot of work to do. Don't put on this act about how reasonable and thoughtful and so pressured we are in trying to reconcile all of the particular problems there are in the closing days. 
   Don't give me any of that. Let's get to the reality. 
   We have a special interest bill; we have a bill affecting workers. I want to put up another bill affecting the workers that have been up all year long and all last year--minimum wage. The majority leader won't come out and say it is relevant. When he comes out and says it is relevant, I will put up the amendment; we can vote in 10 minutes' time. When he says a special interest bill, Shays-Meehan is relevant; we can vote in 10 minutes. The House has voted on it overwhelmingly. 
   We couldn't get a vote on account of the so-called rules of the majority leader with respect to when we can call something and when we can't call anything around here. They won't give us a freestanding Shays-Meehan without the cloture and everything else. 
   I have been interested in campaign finance reform since I voted for the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. We had that bill up, and we had a good bipartisan cross-section vote for the measure saying one cannot buy the office. We have come full circle. What we are saying in Washington today is, the trouble is, there isn't enough money to buy the office. Do you know what? We have amendments. Mr. President, $1,000 isn't enough; we ought to be able to buy it quicker with $3,000 and $5,000, $10,000. We have moved in the opposite direction from the original intent of cleaning up politics in this land of ours by stating categorically one could not buy the office. 
   I can still see the Senator from Louisiana, Russell Long. He said, every man a king--everybody, regardless of economic circumstance or background, could aspire for the Presidency of this land of ours. Listen to Elizabeth Dole. One can be a former Secretary of Commerce, one can be a Secretary of Transportation and Secretary of Labor, one can have been head of the American Red Cross, every kind of track record, but unless the candidate has the money, the candidate doesn't stand a chance--money is what talks. 
   We are saying it is a real problem. On the one hand, we have too many limits, we ought to have more money in this; or, on the other hand, let taxpayers, let the public, pay for our politics; let's have public campaign finance. We have had about three votes on it. 
   I remember when I first introduced it, it was a joint resolution. There was  one line, and it is in now, but I can't get it up. I have been waiting for a good joint resolution to come over, Senator. If it comes over, I will offer it. They told me I couldn't offer it to campaign finance reform because mine was a joint resolution and it was a simple bill, with three readings to be signed. A joint resolution, of course, and amending the Constitution, is not to be signed by the President. 
   That being the case, I put in this particular one-line amendment that the Congress of the United States is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. I had a dozen good Republican colleagues--my senior colleague and others--joined as cosponsors way back; this has to be almost 20 years ago. We can't get that, except for the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER. So the Hollings-Specter amendment was so salutary that the States said, wait a minute, add that the States are hereby empowered to control or regulate spending in Federal elections. 
   So we added that. We have gotten a majority vote, but we never have gotten the two-thirds necessary. It would pass. I am not worried about it at any next election. It would easily come about. 
   We relied upon looking at the last five of the six amendments. They passed in an average of 17 months. 
   Does the distinguished Senator have a question? I am just feeling good about this particular measure.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. 
   What happens if we can get up campaign finance and get an up-or-down vote on Shays-Meehan? I have my doubts about its constitutionality. I have voted several times for McCain-Feingold. I voted against the most revised or limited McCain-Feingold for the simple reason it was similar to half a haircut; it was worse than none at all. It said the parties couldn't take soft money but everyone else could take soft money. 
   Immediately, my adversary, Tom Donohue at the Chamber of Commerce, said we had not participated financially sufficiently in campaigns. So I am getting up a kitty of $5 million. The Chamber of Commerce will get up a kitty of $5 million and pick some 8 or 10 senatorial races and give them at least $100,000. 
   Mind you me, the Chamber of Commerce no longer represents Main Street America, no longer represents the middle-size or small business; rather the international, the transnational, the gone overseas crowd, such as the Farley group that has already transferred 17,000 jobs offshore. It is headquarters to the Cayman Islands. I don't know whether those are foreign contributions. I had better look into that. It strikes me they are talking about the Chinese. I am wondering whether the Chinese have any worse position that the Cayman Islanders to make contributions. I think we ought to call Janet Reno and say here is an example of foreign contributions by the Cayman Island Farley to the campaigns--$500,000 for George. Poor George W. will never get through the year. They will find these things I am talking about. Poor fellow, he hasn't gotten into the Washington go-round. This crowd will chew anyone up. 
   See how the logic applies. We are all talking about the Attorney General not doing enough on some antiquated contribution; that happened way back. I am talking about what is being made now in this week's Time magazine, the Cayman Island contributions to poor George W. in Texas, and he probably doesn't even know it--when one runs a mammoth national campaign. We will have to look into that. 
   We have a special interest bill. We need a vote on Shays-Meehan to find out whether it is constitutional or to make sure, along with it, to constitutionalize Shays-Meehan by coming right along and taking the Hollings-Specter amendment to constitutionalize it. 
   As I was about to say before examined by my distinguished friend from Nevada, we have found that of the last eight amendments to the Constitution, seven have passed in 17 months' time. 
   There is no debate, and they all relate to elections. There is no greater cancer on the body politic than the campaign finance practices in this land. 
   Everybody talks about the amount of money. I would say a word about the amount of time. As a full-time Senator, I am supposed to be giving full time to the problems of the people of South Carolina. But I found myself last year giving full time to my particular problem of staying in office, by going all over the country, trying to collect funds from anybody and everybody who thought I could be a pretty good Senator. 
   This was the seventh time I have been elected to the Senate. I am still the junior Senator. I am working hard on my way up. 
   Be that as it may, when I first got elected back 33 years ago, it was a little budget, somewhere, I think, around $400,000 or $500,000. I had to collect $5.5 million last year. 
   In a small State where they are all Republicans, such as Delaware and South Carolina, we have that Dupont crowd. We have them. They are the best of the best. But all my State has gone Republican as did the South: two Republican Senators in Texas, two in Alabama, two in Mississippi, and two in Tennessee. October of last year I was the last remaining statewide Democrat in office except for my friend the comptroller, Earl Morris. He and I were the last two: city councils, mayor, the Governor, the legislature--all Republican. With this recording of every contribution in and every contribution out, there were a lot of Republican friends who wanted to participate. But we put that burden on them. They would have to, literally, explain why they gave that fellow HOLLINGS $100 or $1,000, whatever the contribution was. 
   Rather than become involved--if we want to know what cuts off people have from involvement in the process in America today, it is just this particular requirement. I voted for that requirement. I think it ought to be made public. But it can get bad, and it does, and has gotten bad in my State. 
   We can correct this. We can constitutionalize whatever is the intent of Congress. You do not have to get that distorted opinion of Buckley v. Valeo for the simple reason that they said money amounted to speech. Those with money had all the speech they wanted, but those who did not have money could get lockjaw. They could just shut up and sit down. ``You are not in the swim, Liddy Dole; you are not in the race at all. You can forget about it.'' The party has already arranged and crowned George W. in Texas, and he has $50 million to $60 million. He doesn't need the public money, and everybody thinks that is great. 
   I think that is not great at all. I think when it has gotten to be that bad, when you have enough money, like Perot, to start a party, and you have enough money to control the party as is being done now on the Republican side, we have to clean this thing up and get back to not being able to buy the office. So I would have campaign finance reform as a very strong amendment and make sure there is no question. 
   Time magazine thinks it is relevant, but the Senator from Mississippi does not think it is relevant. If he can come out and if he will make the proposal that he does think it is relevant, we can agree on a time agreement on Shays-Meehan, 5 minutes to a side, and vote. Do not come weeping and wailing that, Oh, we have so many things to get done, we have the appropriations' bills, we have this bill, we have that bill, and everything like that. This is not a time-consumption strategy on the part of the Senator from South Carolina. This is to bring to the fore that which has been prevented from  even being debated in this body. The most deliberative body in the history of the world can no longer, under the process, deliberate. You have to walk up to the table and find out how to vote. 
   I was here with Senator Mansfield. Senator Mansfield would think that demeaning, to put there how a Senator is supposed to 
   vote. Senator Dirksen would absolutely oppose nonsense of that kind. But that is how we all are going. You have to do it this way and get on message. You cannot debate what the public wants debated. You can only debate what the polls show to be debated. 
   Everybody is running all over the world talking about education because it shows up in the polls. But we only control 7 cents of every education dollar; the 93 cents, that is the State and local responsibility. Bless them, I am a leader on that subject. You name another Senator in this body who has put up a 3 percent sales tax and passed it for public education. You name another one who has come in with a system of technical training that would even equal--much less be better than--ours. 
   I have worked in the vineyards over the years for education so I do not demean the need for improving the quality of education, namely, doubling the pay of teachers. So you get what you pay for. If we start attracting the best and the brightest, they do not need retraining; they need money. They need to be paid. The average pay, I think, in South Carolina, is around $27,000 or $28,000. Maybe it has gone up to $31,000. Don't hold me to the exact figure. But I know that is relevant. That doesn't pay for the children to go to college. I go to the graduations and they come across the stage. ``Senator, I would like to have taught, but I am not able to get into teaching because I cannot save enough money to get my children through school and college. So what do I do? I get into international studies, business course and otherwise.'' 
   Mr. President, we have the Kathie Lee sweatshop bill here before us, where 17,000, according to Time Magazine, have gone from Kentucky in the last few years. I have the exact figures. I had a talk the weekend before last to the northern textile industry. The Senator from Delaware had all of his textile people there, Drew Potter and otherwise. I was glad to talk to the northern textile industry people. 
   I want to make a record of this particular situation because this is how bad it can get, how politics can really take over. I have been the principal sponsor of five textile bills that have passed this Senate, four of them have passed the Senate and the House of Representatives and gone to the President of the United States. One was vetoed by President Carter, two by President Reagan, and one by President Bush. I remember when President Bush implied, in his commitment to the talk in Greenville, that he was for textiles. When asked how come he vetoed it, he said, ``C'est la vie.'' He not only wants to import the textiles, he wants to import the language. That is how far off we have gotten. 
   I could not get invited. I tried last year. Here is a fellow who has grown up and held just about every office at the local level: Lieutenant Governor and Governor and Senator elected seven times. But I tried. They have a little lunch or evening meal, I think it is, at the Piedmont Club, these new young executives. I said: You know, I ought to make an appearance there because they have a new group and everything else. I could not get invited. They never could find a time. 
   I had some old-time leaders say: We will arrange it for you. I could get invited, thanks to Karl Spilhaus and the leadership of the northern textile industry. At least I can get invited now to the northern textile industry, but I could not get invited to my own backyard. 
   Here, as the cosponsor and voter for the right to work bill, I am out here trying to protect organized labor because--where are they? I heard that Ms. Evelyn Dubrow is finally back in town. 
   She is the best of the best. She just won the Presidential Medal last month. I congratulate her. She has been outstanding over the years. Maybe if I explain this bill long enough, we might be able to pick up some votes. 
   I see others waiting. I said I would take at least 15 minutes. My good friend from Minnesota, who really held the fort down yesterday, has been trying to get recognized to say a few words. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I came momentarily to the floor to hear my distinguished colleague from Louisiana try to justify that Bill Farley article in Time magazine, which I referred to earlier. His justification, of course, was not the matter of campaign finance reform, which is the major thrust of the article; interestingly, the thrust that, look, we ought to be getting rid of these jobs, says that these textile workers now can go to the high-skilled, better-paying jobs, and that is the future of America. 
   Let me go right to the other comment made by my distinguished colleague from New York, who joined with it, about trade adjustment assistance, and what a wonderful program it is. Thirty-seven years ago, as he said, as Dean Acheson would say, he was at the table. He is right. He had a distinguished career of service there as the Assistant Secretary of Labor negotiating the trade adjustment assistance agreement. Everybody will agree with that. 
   But 38 years ago, I was at the table, and I was at the table for the seven-point textile program of President Kennedy. It was a very interesting exercise because what we had found out was that they were really about to do away with the industry, we thought, when it included some 10-percent import penetration. I had come up to testify before the old International Trade Commission, and testifying before that International Trade Commission, we thought we had made a good impression. 
   At that particular time, 38 years ago, we were confronted with Tom Dewey, who was then representing the Japanese. He chased me all around the hearing room, and my friend, Charlie Daniel, at that time an outstanding contractor/builder/civic leader, says: Now, Governor, let's go by and see the chief. That was President Eisenhower. We called on Wilton B. Parsons, and Jerry Parsons ushered us in and President Eisenhower said: Don't worry, you will win that case. 
   In June, the International Trade Commission ruled against us. At that particular time, we realized we were totally lost unless we could get involved in the campaign, which wasn't too difficult because then-Senator John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts understood very clearly the importance of the textile jobs. 
   I am going right back to the Senator from Louisiana saying the future of the country is to get rid of these jobs. I am laying the groundwork of the historical record about the importance and the significance of these jobs. 
   The case was in talking to then-Senator Kennedy. We met with him. And my friend, Mr. Feldman, was his legislative assistant. We obtained a letter on August 30, 1960. You can imagine, this was in the heat of the 1960 campaign between Kennedy and Nixon.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the letter he said he supported the special Senate subcommittee of the textile industry under the chairmanship of Senator Pastore. He said he agreed with the conclusions of the Pastore committee that sweeping changes in our Federal trade policy were not necessary:  
   Nevertheless, we must recognize that the textile and apparel industries are international in scope and peculiarly susceptible to competitive pressure from imports. The problems of the industry will not disappear by neglect, nor can we wait for a large-scale unemployment and shutdown to inspire us to action. So a comprehensive industrywide remedy is necessary.  
   They had a national security provision in the law at that particular time. Before then-Senator Kennedy and later-President Kennedy could actually implement any kind of comprehensive industrywide remedy, he had to have a finding that the industry was important to our national security. 
   We brought the witnesses. It was a Cabinet committee that was formed for the witnesses to attest to. It was Secretary Dean Rusk of the Department of State, Secretary McNamara with the Department of Defense, Secretary of Commerce Hodges, Secretary of Labor Goldberg, Secretary of the Treasury Dillon, and Secretary of Agriculture Freeman, with whom I served as Governor. 
   They had the hearings, and they concluded at the close of those hearings that next to steel, textiles was the second most important to our national security. In a line, you needed steel in order to make the weapons of war and the tools of agriculture. Therein lies the steel problem, because that is the World Bank singsong. They run the world around telling these emerging Third World countries that they cannot become a nation state until at first they obtain a strong manufacturing sector, particularly in steel. 
   That is why, incidentally, you have the dumping. We have an overproduction in the world of steel. They are dumping here in the United States at less than cost. We have had the hearings, and they voted on the House side. We tried to get a vote on this side and get the bill passed for action by the White House itself. 
   But back to the second most important industry that I would like the Senator from Louisiana to remember, because I remember when he had a substantial investment by Fruit of the Loom down there in Louisiana before it left, and now it looks as if it has all gone to the Cayman Islands. But you couldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform. This is back in 1960. Today, you might say a Chinese uniform, because the Chinese have gone just 8 years ago from a $5 billion deficit in the balance of trade to a $55 billion deficit in the balance of trade, mostly in textiles and clothing. 
   So we have to go to conflict with our friends in the People's Republic. We have to call up Beijing and say: Wait a minute. Before we have this standoff, please send us some uniforms because we have to be prepared in order to go to battle. We can't go in Chinese uniforms. We have to be able to distinguish the troops. 
   As a result of that finding, then-President Kennedy, on April 24, 1961, promulgated his seven-point program. 
   He did all of the things that dealt with that and followed on into the Kennedy Round, as the distinguished Senator from New York has pointed out, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, one-price cotton, and reciprocity, which stabilized the industry for several years ongoing until really the 1970s, and then, of course, the 1980s and early 1990s with all the vetoes by President Reagan and President Bush. There has just been a deluge. With President Clinton, the deluge turned into a waterfall more or less with NAFTA. 
   For those who say that these things, as the distinguished Senator from Ohio said, are going to create millions of jobs in the United States and the world around, let us be accurate. It will create millions of jobs in the world around. It is going to create millions of ``jobless.'' We have lost over 1 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA here in the United States. There are 420,000 textile jobs lost all over the country, 31,700 in the State of South Carolina alone. 
   There is no education in the second kick of a mule. 
   What we have on foot is another NAFTA without the advantages. At least in NAFTA, we had the side agreements on labor rights. At least in NAFTA, we had the side agreements on the environment. At least in NAFTA, we had reciprocity. 
   Now this one-way street down to the Caribbean and over to the Sahara is totally out of the whole cloth. It will start a deluge. We know about the Chinese and their influence in the sub-Sahara. 
   I will never forget, 5 years ago we had a resolution brought up about human rights. They had voted in the assembly to have hearings on human rights in the People's Republic of China. The Chinese representatives went down into Africa where they have some influence. I was there 25 years ago. They were building the railroad from inner Zaire, the old-time Belgian Congo, out to the coast. They had their work crews all over, their minions all over. They have influence, and it was proved at that time because they changed the vote. They never had that hearing that the United Nations wanted to have on human rights in the People's Republic. 
   We know, looking at Matsui, the shirts coming through at this moment from Matsui. There is not a shirt factory there. 
   They have been inundating the American market. 
   We go to Customs. They say: Senator, they have been inundating the market, but we restrict it. Customs agents ask if we want to stop drugs or stop textiles. Of course, the obvious answer is, heavens, stop the drugs. They say: Until you get the other agents, that is about all we can try to keep up with. 
   The Customs Department has estimated $5 billion already in transshipments, illegal entry of textile goods in the United States, as we speak. We know the sub-Sahara is not going to benefit by it at all with respect to the jobs. It is going to be similar to our minority business enterprise section in the Department of Commerce. They immediately got minority, a black front; then they got the white money and the folks behind it. And with the front, they make a lot of money and get the set-aside contracts through hard experience in Mexico. 
   I refer particularly to the fabric manufacturers down there. The Senator from Louisiana says we ought to be getting rid of the industry. We ought to remember we are going to get something we didn't have before; namely, with all the cotton goods and everything else we are sending, our fabric and the apparel, shirts for example, will come back with American-made fabric. That is what can come back free of duty, free of restriction. But so can the Chinese-made fabrics. So can the Taiwanese. So can the Korean. 
   All one needs to do is cross the border at Tijuana in lower California into  Mexico and one will think they are in Seoul, Korea. They are not at all bashful about investing there. 
   The Fabric Resource List of Mexico, appearing in Davison's blue book, I refer to pages 345 to 358 under Fabric Resource List. 
   Mr. President, we can see the opportunity and to whom it is being given. Very interestingly, the commitment when we passed NAFTA, from the individuals at the time that the ATMI came in, they say they are not going to take their plants down there. 
   I refer to an article in the Capital City's Media, back in 1993. The lead article and lead sentence of the article entitled ``Hell No, We Won't Go'':  
   That was the battle cry Monday by the directors of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, who in a last-ditch effort to solidify congressional support for NAFTA, pledged not to move any jobs to Mexico if the act was passed. The ATMI board, made up of firms representing every facet of the textile industry, voted 37-6 in favor of the resolution which said companies would not move jobs, plants or facilities from the United States to Mexico as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement.  
   Just in the past year Dan River built an integrated apparel manufacturing plant in Mexico. Another U.S. corporation, Tarrant Apparel purchased a denim mill in Pueblo, Mexico; DuPont and Alpek built a plant in Altimira, Mexico, and formed a joint venture with Teijin; Guilford and Cone Mills created a Mexican industrial park known as Textile City; and Burlington Industries is to build a new Mexican plan to produce wool products. 
   It reminds me of John Mitchell, the former Attorney General. He said: Watch what we do, not what we say. 
   Now we know what they do. They go down into Mexico and they invest very heavily. Our friend from Louisiana says the jobs are not important and they moved to higher skilled jobs. I know we have restrictions on the importation of cotton because he says: Look at the cotton. They have quota programs and they have payments they receive for the use of U.S. cotton. That goes back to the One Price Cotton Program we got way back under President Kennedy. 
   The statement made by the Senator from Louisiana is that we are going to get something that we didn't have. The Caribbean and sub-Sahara are going to get something they didn't have. We are going to lose. Yes, we have protection for American cotton producers and they are buying from American cotton producers. But if you go down into Mexico and the plants all go down there, they don't have to worry about coming back in with respect to American-made fabric because they can go ahead and produce it and bring it back in any way. We are going to be losing that business. Last fall, they had section 807 and 809 and everything else the companies themselves approved. That is not productive at all because they are moving down there. That is why they are moving the fabric plants. And there are no restrictions on those under the NAFTA agreement. 
   With respect to the export nature of the job, there is a book written by our friend, Eamonn Fingleton. He wrote the book some 10 years ago entitled ``Blind Side.'' He pointed out at that particular time that the little country of 125 million Japanese was outproducing the 260 million productive Americans. In manufacturing today, Japan still outproduces us. They were talking about the growth of the economy because they know how to build up an economy. 
   Who predicted by the year 2000 the GNP, or gross domestic product, of Japan would exceed that of the richest United States of America? They still could reach it in spite of the turndown of the banking industry and otherwise. They haven't yielded one bit on market share this past year in spite of the turndown in the Japanese economy, the automobile industry. The Japanese automobile industry has taken over again a larger share of the American market. They continue to do so and they continue to invest here, as we know, because we have the Japanese plants in my State of South Carolina. 
   We continue to weaken what President Kennedy and others knew was necessary to build a strong economy, as if resting on a three-legged stool. One leg is our values; that is unquestioned. The second leg is the military strength, which is unquestioned--the remaining superpower. The third leg, economics, having been fractured in the last 10 years. We have gone from 26 percent of our workforce and manufacturing is down to 13 percent. 
   We are losing and hollowing out the industrial center, the middle class of America. I do not have the ratings of the particular jobs they have at Amazon, but I have a good idea of it. I do not believe they are paying as much at Amazon and these other industries as they are in textiles. The average textile wage in the United States is around $8.37 an hour. The needle trades, Senator BREAUX pointed out, in Kentucky, Fruit of the Loom eliminated more than 7,000 jobs in the past 6 years. Here, ``Would-be workers attend a job fair held by the new arrival, Amazon.'' 
   You do not stand in line to get a job at Microsoft. They have 22,000. You stand at the bank or you stand at the country club. You have to not only have the high intellect, but you have to have the connections. Anybody who is lucky enough to get a job at Microsoft, they ought to go say their prayers at night and thank heavens because it is wonderful. Every one of those 22,000 are millionaires. 
   That is not the jobs we are talking about, those superduper jobs. We are talking about the 250,000 working at General Motors. We are talking about the 1.6 million still left, maybe 2 million--I can't get the exact figure--of textile jobs left in America. These jobs are important to our national economy. They not only have a national security portion of being able to produce the garments and the uniforms but more particularly to maintain middle America. That is where it is so important. I am going to get the exact pay scale there. I know PSC Corporation, in my own capital city of Columbia, SC, has already shipped out some 500 jobs to India. I forget the exact name of the town. But they can start up the computers in India and get the information back there, and they tell me my light bill is being processed over in India for me right now. That is the trend, the global competition. That is the global development. That is the reality. How do we confront it? Do we maintain a strong manufacturing sector and strengthen that economic leg to our national security? 
   Go right back to Alexander Hamilton in the earliest days. In the earliest days, you had that doctrine of market forces, comparative advantage, and David Ricardo. That is what they said, Adam Smith--you go ahead, the little fledgling colony that now had won its independence, you produce best what you can and ship it back to the mother country and the mother country in turn will produce and ship back what we can produce best--the doctrine of comparative advantage. 
   Alexander Hamilton said, ``No way.'' He wrote the book, ``Reports On Manufactures.'' In that particular book he told the Brits to bug off. He said: We are not going to remain your colony. 
   As a result, the second bill that ever passed this national Congress, in which we stand this afternoon--the first being the U.S. seal--the second bill on July 4, 1789, was a tariff bill, protectionism of a 50-percent tariff on 60 different articles, including our iron and textiles and other things we were beginning to build up--our manufacturing capacity. 
   Now we hear, to my amazement, the cry on the floor of the Senate: Get rid of it. We are going to become a service economy. We are going to have nothing but software. We are going to have millionaires and country clubs and bread lines and that is going to be America. They had that right after World War II. They told the Brits: Don't worry. Instead of a nation of brawn, we are going to be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products, we will provide services. Instead of creating wealth, we are going to handle it, become a financial center. 
   The mother country has gone to hell in an economic handbasket. London is nothing more than an amusement park. They do have the two levels of society and they put it on every night on educational TV, public television: ``Upstairs Downstairs.'' Everybody grins and smiles and says: Oh, those were wonderful days. We can all be 
   maids and servants in the kitchen or we can be plantation owners. That is where we are headed. That is where we are headed with this cry of ``free trade, free trade,'' that is enunciated by everybody who does not have an interest in the future of the United States.  
   That ``everybody'' includes the banks. They first financed these companies, these multinationals, under the Marshall Plan that we sent overseas. Then the think tanks and consultants, then the lawyers, then the retailers. ``You can get a cheaper product,'' and everything else of that kind. Then the consumer groups and what have you. So they all come in and say ``free trade, free trade,'' until you get to intellectual property and ``Oh, no, wait a minute. We have to have trademarks; we have to have copyright; we have to have protectionism.'' 
   They are for protectionism. Jack Valenti in the movies, he will run over here and knock down the desks and everything else. Wait a minute, Hollywood is the biggest protectionist center in the world; protectionism, as they spew out their violence. They killed our TV violence bill momentarily. We keep coming back and we will bring it back again. But I can tell you here and now they want protectionism for the banks, for the insurance companies, for the rich, for the software people but nothing for the sweat of the brow. That is what gets me, when the Senator from Louisiana says now what we need to do is go get a high-skilled, better paying job. That is the future of America. 
   There is a different future. I hate to disabuse his mind on that particular score. There is a book written about this. As Fingleton points out now in his more recent book, ``In Praise of Hard Industries,'' he takes down, chapter and verse: With respect to exports, there is no contribution whatsoever. It is almost negligible. The idea of the software and the high-tech industry --in fact, it was going broke itself in semiconductors until, what did we do? We gave them aid. We put in Sematech and we put in voluntary restraint agreements--give President Reagan credit for that--to save that particular industry, or you would not be seeing any Intel on that stock market, going up yesterday. The Government gave it a chance to survive. That is all the textile industry is asking this afternoon is for a chance to survive. 
   Two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported. Do we want to send the rest of it down there? We have shown all the fabric plants they can manufacture if they go down there, and they will go. Do they want to do that for the sub-Sahara, not having any side agreements or understanding about labor rules, not having an understanding about the environment, not having any reciprocity? 
   Let me get to the restrictions. This industry is terribly restricted. They should understand it right now. That is, I hold in my hand ``Foreign Regulations Affecting U.S. Textile and Apparel Exports.'' That was, a few years ago, in one book. Now they put it out in different, separate items with respect just to the United States, and they do not put it in a book because they think we were the only ones who had any restrictions whatsoever. But can't we do away with the restrictions, not only on the textile industry but the restrictions that they have with respect to the Caribbean Basin Initiative? I have the various products. 
   Mr. President, knit fabrics, Rwanda. Of course, 100 percent on knit fabrics, 100 percent on apparel. Mali, we have restrictions there. You can turn to the restrictions with the other countries: Gabon, 30 percent on apparel compared to our 10 percent in the United States; Ethiopia, 80 percent compared to our 10 percent. We have already given them the advantage by far. 
   My hangup is, we have given the advantage to the Koreans, the People's Republic of China, the Taiwanese, the Japanese, the Malaysians. They have the investments in these countries, and they will have a few jobs to give out, but they will literally take the remaining one-third of the American market and put out of business a wonderful basic industry important to our national security. 
   I say ``a wonderful'' because I watched in the early days when they got the dust and lint in their faces and hair. That is why they called them lint heads. That is not the case anymore. There is no one in the card room. It is mechanically, electronically controlled. In the weave room, where they had 125 people, there are fewer than 15 now. They have modern machinery. 
   The main point is it has afforded jobs for minorities and for women. You hardly found women in the fabric or textile plants; you found them in sewing. Now they represent over 50 percent of employees. It is a good paying job. If the husband has a job and if a woman can make $8.30 an hour, that can help put the boys through Clemson University. That is what they are doing in my backyard in South Carolina. 
   They have invested, on average, $2 billion a year for some 15 years. But now they look at this measure--which is really foreign aid, a giveaway to make a record to build a library for the President and for the idle rich over on the other side of the aisle who believe in money and market and not the country itself. They will give anything away. All they want now, like their software crowd after we started the Internet, after we gave them the education at Stanford, after all the other protections, now they want to do away with the estate tax, do away with the capital gains tax, do away with the immigration laws; let them all come in so we can get them even cheaper labor; let's do away with State tort laws, Y2K; let's just do away with the Government. That is the crowd over on the other side of the aisle. I take the floor because that is where we are headed. This industry is watching closely because they do not want to be in a position of not getting their money back. 
   We have these wonderful textile shows--the machinery boys come from all over the world--in Greenville, SC, at the center. They want to stay ahead of the curve, and they want to be productive, and they are productive, and they do compete. I categorically claim the U.S. textile industry is the most productive in the entire world, bar none. But they cannot afford to remain productive with this initiative because they will not get their money back. 
   They know the transshipments. They know how the Chinese built these parks in Vietnam. That is why you find the Burlingtons and the Cone Mills and the Guilfords all going down there because they want to stay in business and they have to make money. So they have to break their pledge not to move plants, not to move jobs, and they all are headed down there. 
   I do not know who is going to be able to hold on in the United States if this measure passes. The ATMI--that crowd is defunct, I can tell you that. I can say that advisedly because I have gotten every award they give. Otherwise, the AAMA, the American Apparel Manufacturers Association--and a man by the name of Larry Martin, a wonderful individual, with whom I have worked for the enactment of textile bills over the last 30 years --ought to be renamed the Central American Apparel Manufacturers. They do not have U.S. apparel manufacturers. 
   It is just like our friend from the Cayman Islands. It is gone. Fruit of the Loom, Sara Lee, Limited--``The fruit of its 
   labor, the politics of underwear.'' That is the particular article that came out. They are ready to go. They are now in the Cayman Islands. And I will ask Janet Reno to look into this: I say to the Senator from North Dakota--they are talking about Chinese contributions. I am wondering about these Cayman Islands contributions. I don't think George W. knows, but he already has $400,000 from Bill Farley and Fruit of the Loom, according to this article. They are down in the Caymans. 
   Don't give me this cheese board they have up here, how wonderful this is and everybody but HOLLINGS is for the measure. Why do you think they could not get the black caucus over there or why couldn't they get JESSE JACKSON, Jr., for this bill? Why not go for the Jackson bill? That is what he was for, not for this particular measure. Why did the black ministers in Boston march on the industries? Because they are not taken over with the bum's rush of that corporate business banking crowd that wants to make an even bigger profit. 
   Former Secretary of Labor, little Bobby Reich, put out a book. I wish you all would read that book. On page 179, you will find out the Fortune 500 has not created a new job in the United States of America in the last 10 years. That book is about 6 or 7 years old, but is still on point, and will be for sometime to come. They are not creating the jobs. They are firing everybody. The companies I am referring to are all listed on the charts. They are getting  rid of the jobs and getting rid of the industry. That is what we have in the balance this afternoon. 
   I emphasize that it is one way, and it is not NAFTA and the nice plea that it has worked so well down in Mexico so let's extend it to sub-Sahara, let's extend it to Central America. We are not, if I have anything to do with it, going to pass this Kathie Lee sweatshop measure. It has not worked in El Salvador. 
   The Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, wanted to put a child labor amendment on this measure. Of course, now that they have filled up the tree and have given fast track to this measure, we cannot offer an amendment for labor rights, for the environment, for reciprocity. We are going the way of Mexico. 
   Let me momentarily hold up with one observation about NAFTA because the claim was made at that time in the debate that they would create 200,000 jobs. It has not created new jobs. We have lost 420,000 textile jobs. They said we are going to have better wage rates. Actually, the take-home wage of the country we were trying to help, Mexico, is less in 1999 than in 1994 and 1995 when we passed NAFTA. 
   Then they said it was going to help the immigration problem because they are going to have so many jobs. The immigration problem has worsened. 
   I know better than any. I handle the immigration appropriation. We have a school for the Border Patrol agents. We have literally graduated thousands of Border Patrol Spanish-speaking agents for the Border Patrol down in my hometown. And the immigration problem is, again, even worse. Ask the Senators from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN and Mrs. BOXER. 
   And then drugs. Oh, yeah, we were going to solve the drug problem. That has gotten worse. 
   So NAFTA is not a good example of a positive experience with a trade agreement. It is like they keep talking about deregulation of the airlines. I could go on for 2 or 3 hours about that one. We are in an FAA authorization bill now. 
   We used to come specifically with the town, the mayor, the tax base, build the airport, get the facilities, go out and get Captain Rickenbacker and Eastern Airlines, and come to the CAB and get the rights; and it was a working deal. You got good service. The community controlled the so-called slots, and everything else of that kind. It worked. 
   But they got this urge to deregulate, deregulate, and we have now come full swing, full circle. The regulated are buying up the deregulated. You don't get the service. You have all kinds of costs. 
   I bought a ticket a few weeks ago for my wife. The day before we did not think the plane was going to fly on account of Hurricane Floyd. We found out it was, so we bought the ticket. It was $748, round trip, from Washington, DC, to Charleston, SC, and back--$748 dollars. I will show you the ticket. 
   So don't talk about the improvements, and everything else like that, with either deregulation or this singsong the money crowd puts on with respect to NAFTA and how well it has worked and how everybody is for it. 
   Everybody is not for this. Those who are looking and have studied and worked in the trade field realize we are going the way of England and that we just can't afford it any longer. I almost say we, more or less, have given away the store, as they say, in the community chest. As they said to me back in those Governor days: Governor, what do you expect them to make? The airplanes and the computers? Let them make the shoes. Let them make the clothing. And we will make the airplanes and the computers. 
   My problem is they are making the shoes, they are making the clothing, they are making the airplanes, they are making the computers. That Boeing crowd from Washington is beginning to sober up because their bus is being dumped. Ask these airlines whether they are buying Boeing or Lockheed. No, no, no. They are being dumped on account of the price and financing, and everything else of that kind. And the competition is government; and the policy is set by that government. 
   Senators say look before you open up Conrad Manufacturing. You have to have a minimum wage, clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave--I could keep going on and on. They can go down to Mexico now for 58 cents an hour, and there is none of that. 
   So what is happening in the job policy where you can save as much as 20 percent on your manufacturing cost, which is 30 percent of volume? If you move your manufacturing to a low-wage country, and just keep your executive office and your sales force, and you have $500 million in sales, saving 20 percent moving to that low-wage country, before taxes you can make $100 million. Or you know what, you can continue to work your own people and go bankrupt. 
   That is the job policy of the national Congress. That is the job policy we are discussing this afternoon on the floor of the Senate. That is what we are talking about: How can we say this is for the people, how we say this is going to create jobs, knowing full well it is going to result in a loss of jobs. 
   That is why the labor people, and that is why so many African Americans, that is why all are beginning to get stirred. That is what makes Pat Buchanan make sense until lately when he began to talk that nonsense about Hitler. That is the worse thing that ever happened to this particular debate because he was talking sense at the time before he wrote his silly book about Hitler and all these other things. But he is talking about the passing army. That is labor in America. They realize they are hearing all this pretty talk from Washington and how we are going to do this and how we got to go do that--global economy, global competition, and everything else of that kind--and they keep losing out. 
   They are wondering what is happening when the Republicans and Democrats say the same thing. And so Buchanan comes out, and was the best voice we had in a national sense. I have been talking trade while that boy was in Gonzaga. Is that the name of the high school around here, Gonzaga High School? Gonzaga High School--I was working on this when he was at Gonzaga High School beating up everybody. I know him and like him. I get along with him very well. But he has poisoned the well on this particular score because he loses credibility on the most important issue next to the budget. The second most important is the economy and trying to maintain middle America. 
   And they tell me--the Senator from Louisiana--all they have to do is get in line and go to Amazon. The fact is that those jobs are not paying as much. These retail jobs just do not provide the same pay. In fact, they make them independent contractors to avoid paying their health costs and everything else. 
   In fact, take the example--and I will sit down and yield to my colleagues because I have plenty more to cover--with respect to Oneida knitting mills down in Andrews, SC, they had to close the first of the year. We bought them less than 35 years ago, a fine little plant. They had 487 employees, with the average age of 47 years old. 
   Tell them to get retrained and get skilled tomorrow morning--Washington's approach and the approach of the Senator from Louisiana--get that skill as a computer operator and go apply to Amazon as a 47-year-old. Do you think Amazon is going to employ the 47-year-old or the 21-year-old computer operator? They are sidelined, deadlined. They are out. 
   This is the issue they ought to be debating in this Presidential race. But since the pollsters are all on education, education, education, and the Governors, education, education, the size of the class, more this, more that, reeducate, reteach, everything else like that, they are not talking about the real problem that we at the Washington level are talking about. 
   On education, the federal government only spends 7 cents on the dollar; the other 93 cents comes from the local level. So we are not going to do much on that. But here, when we can do something, we are doing the wrong thing and going in the wrong direction. 
   They put up these cheese boards around how the Citicorp and that rich crowd is all for it. All they are doing is trying to make money. They are not trying to create jobs. 
   Read Bobby Reich's book. He's right, the Fortune 500 are not creating jobs at  all. We supposedly are trying to, but at the same time we are canceling out these efforts with this job policy. 
   We have to phase out right now the Multifiber Arrangement. We are going into the fifth year of it. The real hard part is going to be hitting. I can tell you right now, after this election in November 2000, the next President who is going to come on is going to have some real problems. And, Senator, you and I, hopefully, if the Lord is willing, will be here. And we ought to be doing something about it now. 
   We certainly ought not to be taking this bum's rush that comes out of the Finance Committee. Because that is what they do to me every time. That is what they did on NAFTA. That is what they did on GATT. They wait until the last 10 days of a particular session. Then they come out and they grease it and they give it fast track. They file it. They put in two amendments. They fill up the tree. They file cloture. And say: Ha, ha, ha, we are going off to the party. Struggle as you will. But we have it fast tracked. And this is going to pass whether you like it or not. 
   We have to get out here and get at least some amendments with respect to the labor and environmental rights, with respect to the reciprocity. I hope we will look closely at what has happened here.

   I was listening to my distinguished friend from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH. He was talking about exports and how he got Ohio, as Governor, prepared for exports. As a Governor, I have done the same thing. For both Ohio and South Carolina, there isn't going to be anything left to export. This was last year's statistics. I can tell you the trend is overwhelming in the wrong direction. 
   Look at the deficit in the balance of trade. It is going to approximate this year $300 billion. We are not talking about exports as a wonderful thing. Let's look, as they used to say when my children were growing up, Big John and Sparky, all the way through life, make this your goal; keep your eye on the doughnut and not the hole. We have the eye on the hole. 
   Export, export, that is the singsong. Citibank, Citicorp, and all those other financial institutions listed up there, that banker board and what have you; export, export. What we have to watch is the imports. That is the doughnut. That is the problem we have. 
   When you are spending over $100 billion more than you are taking in, you're going to create a huge economic problem. We should know: the fiscal year just ended, September 30, less than 30 days ago, and we have spent $103 billion more than we took in, we are still running over $100 billion deficits, deficits, deficits. All right. We finally got on to that at least to save Social Security. Now they are talking exports, when they ought to be talking imports because with this particular trend, we don't have anything to export. 
   Exporting movies, exporting software, exporting insurance policies, exporting bank accounts--come on--where is the work there? All you have is this computerization and everything else. You will have your country terribly enfeebled. It is all a bum's rush to let us help the sub-Sahara foreign aid, let us help the Caribbean Basin nations. But they won't have reciprocity down there. They will all move in on those poor little islands, like we called up that little Felicia in Antigua after the poor airmen got killed in the barracks. Don't you remember, at Lebanon? The marines, I should say, got killed in the barracks at Lebanon.  After we lost some 278 marines, they ran down and got suits off the Gulf coast and said: We are invading Granada because Antigua asked us to. 
   We know what is going to happen. Look at the sheet: Kathie Lee sweatshop in El Salvador. If you try to get a union there, they will kill you. They will kill you. I can tell you right now. Workers fired and blacklisted if they tried to defend their rights. Workers paid 15 cents for every $16.96 pair of Kathie Lee pants they sold; starvation wages, locked bathrooms, forced overtime; pregnancy tests; workers illegally fired and intimidated; death threats. To have the audacity to stand on the floor of the Senate and call this a win-win bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished leader came to the floor to withdraw his amendment and substitute the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. He remarked, in the first instance, that we have to hasten it along. We would like to have had the bill up. We would like to have had fast track. 
   Then he insists on fast track on this particular bill. He filled the tree right back up again; namely, we cannot offer amendments. So in one breath he says he would like to have fast track and he is instituting fast track on this particular trade measure. He is an outstandingly talented individual, a fine looking gentleman, and so he stands there with that smile, so reasonable and says: I would like to be sure to check these amendments; we have to make sure they are relevant; I will go along with the Ashcroft agricultural amendment, but I haven't gone along with the Wellstone agricultural amendment. 
   We heard earlier this morning, of course, that the Wellstone agricultural amendment is not relevant. You can look at this bill. You can go right on down the list. You can find out that it is trade benefits for the Caribbean Basin Initiative. They have cover over of tax on distilled spirits, Generalized System of Preferences, trade adjustment assistance affecting the welfare of America's workforce. Nothing in here on agriculture for the CBI and the sub-Sahara. 
   Senator WELLSTONE, who has been trying since January to get up an agricultural amendment, has been put down. He tried all day yesterday and was put down this morning. 
   But if you want to take one of my friend's agricultural amendments--namely, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, who is running for reelection--well, wait a minute now, let's withdraw that last amendment I had and let's put up the irrelevant agricultural amendment of the Senator from Missouri. Irrelevant absolutely. 
   Anybody knows a measure of this kind would go before government ops about an agriculture negotiator in the trade office. 
   And then the argument: We have the President and the leaders and otherwise and so many cosponsors. Well, I have the minimum wage amendment the President has been trying to get up all year long. I have the minimum wage amendment the minority leader would like to have a vote upon. I have a minimum wage amendment that doesn't have 31 but has 27 cosponsors. 
   It sort of fits the pattern, is my point, of the reasoned argument of the distinguished majority leader. But no, not that Wellstone agricultural amendment. That is irrelevant, and we don't want to waste the time because we would be here 2 weeks. We would be here 2 months. We are not going to stand for that, but let us have the agricultural amendment of the Senator from Missouri. 
   Well, that is why I was smiling at my distinguished leader. I was smiling at his duplicity. There it is. You can see it for yourself. I hate to use the word ``arrogant,'' but there is an element of that in this particular procedure. What it insists upon is: I want my way. I am going to control it. You can't put up your amendment. 
   And then they act dismayed when we don't vote cloture. Well, we just won't vote on the agricultural amendment now. We can keep on debating, if that is the procedure they want to continue and insist upon. 
   There isn't any question in my mind about agriculture. I will never forget, some years back we had $21--it got up to $23 billion--the best plus balance we have ever had of any commodity is America's agriculture. We have soybeans. I put in a grain elevator when I was Governor so I know about farmers. I know about soybeans. I know about cotton. 
   I know about exports, and everyone is for America's agriculture, except we oppose that Freedom to Farm thing that wrecked American agriculture--free market forces, free market forces. So they grabbed it up, and all the farmers took the money and ran 3 years ago. Now, the price has gone down and they are broke and they need assistance. That is why the Senator from Minnesota has been on the floor, to try to get some help for America's agriculture, not that bureaucracy over in the office of the Trade Representative  for the purpose of adding another payroll over there. That is the typical Washington political solution: Give another title, add another payroll; just move another little bit on the special trade representative. 
   And everybody knows that when we come to agriculture, we go to the Secretary of Agriculture, and he is there at every table every time we debate because he is steeped in the agricultural needs of the United States of America, and that is why we made good agricultural agreements. I want them to point out a bad agricultural agreement, other than, of course, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has the Senators from North Dakota on durum wheat all over the floor here. They are trying to keep them from dumping on the North Dakota wheat farmers. We all know that. It hasn't worked, and everything else like that, but that is exactly what they want--like they are dumping my textiles, killing 420,000 textile jobs since NAFTA. And there it goes. 
   Then they come around, and let me say that I am glad they removed that sandwich bowl. I will yield in a second. I know there are important statements to be made, and I need help in trying to stop this freight train, stop this steamroller. I have been up here 33 years, and I am still the junior Senator, and I have been trying to get a point of importance with respect to the budget, and nobody listens to me on that. I keep calling it a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office keeps reporting it as a deficit. 
   The law--section 13.301 of the Budget Act--says that the President and the Congress cannot report a budget with the Social Security moneys in it that would cause it to be a surplus. They violate that, and nobody pays attention to us. Of course, they come up and say the interest payments, which exceed the defense budget and the Social Security budget, and all other budgets--a billion dollars a day. When President Johnson balanced the budget, it was only $16 billion for the entire year. In 200 years of history, the cost of all the wars, from the Revolution right up to World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, we still had less than a trillion-dollar debt, and the interest cost was only $16 billion. 
   Now, without the cost of a war since that time--the gulf war incidently was taken care of by the Saudis and others--what has it soared to? To almost $5 trillion or $6 trillion, or something--a trillion-dollar debt and an interest cost the CBO reports as $356 billion. But with interest rates and Mr. Greenspan, it is bound to go up. We are seeing all the signs about consumer confidence. We know it is going to be over a billion a day. 
   So we have fiscal cancer. So we go down this morning at 8 o'clock and borrow a billion and add it to the debt. Tomorrow morning, Friday morning, Saturday morning, Sunday morning, every day for this fiscal year 1999, I will make a bet with anybody, and let them pick out the odds, that they will see a billion dollars a day. Why? Because we are not willing to pay for the 
   Government we are getting. We were willing to, again, add another $100 billion to the deficit just as the year ended, not even a month ago, September 30 of this year--$103 billion more. They won't call that bill the Balanced Budget Act or the Social Security lockbox. I will put it in a lockbox. I got together with the Administrator of Social Security and I said: Write me a bill that will be a true lockbox. I have it. It is hidden in the Budget Committee. They know how to hide it. They don't even want to talk about it. I can't get a hearing on it. I have asked for a hearing. They totally ignore you. 
   But this one says you take that money and immediately redeem it to the credit of Social Security. And don't put in an IOU the first of the month every month. Put the money back into the Social Security trust fund, just as corporate America is required. 
   Now I am back to my friend, Denny McLain. We passed the 1994 Pension Reform Act and we said: Look, these fast takeover artists come in and pay off the company debt with the pension fund and then take the rest of the money and run. People who have been working 30, 40, even 50 years, are left high and dry with no pensions. So we put in the Pension Reform Act of 1994 making it a felony to pay off the company debt with the pension moneys. 
   Unfortunately, one of the all-time great pitchers--which is significant during this World Series fever--Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers, became head of a corporation and paid off the debt with the company fund. He was sentenced to a prison term for a felony. If you can find little Denny in whatever cell he is in, tell him next time to run for the Senate. You get the good government award when you take the pension money of the people's Social Security fund and pay off your debt, so that you can talk about surplus, surplus, surplus, surplus when you are spending $100 billion more than you are taking in and you have got deficits, deficits, deficits as far as the eye can see. 
   That is why I told the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee I would jump off the Capitol dome when he put up that plan called the Balanced Budget Act. They use that jargon and those titles, and the silly press picks up the language and headlines it. 
   So what do we do? We find out, Heavens above, that we are like Tennessee Ernie Ford, ``another day older and deeper in debt.'' And now, instead of 356, if we only paid out $16 billion on a pay-as-you-go basis, since President Lyndon Johnson's day, we would have $340 billion to spend. For what? For agriculture. For what? For the research at the National Institutes of Health. For what? For Kosovo expenses. For what? For all the housing the Secretary of Housing has promulgated, and everything else like that. 
   We could go down and provide for all the programs you could possibly think of. You can double WIC, Head Start, any education programs, just double the education budget. And we can still have what? A tax cut. And still have what? Pay down the debt. With $340 billion--we are spending $340 billion. We are forced to spend it. It is a tax--a tax. What you are doing is raising taxes. You don't want to say it, but you have to pay it, you have to borrow it every day, a billion dollars a day. It is a tax on the American people. With a sales tax, I can get a school; with a gas tax, I can get a highway; with this tax, I get nothing. I served on the Grace Commission on waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the biggest waste ever created in the history of any government. 
   They don't want to talk about that. They want to talk about the sub-Sahara. 
   We are building libraries down in Little Rock now. We are headed for the last roundup. So if we can show that we did something in Africa, and we did something in the CBI, oh isn't it wonderful? The President wants the minimum wage. Leaders want the minimum wage. I have 27 cosponsors who want the minimum wage. It is relevant. Trade adjustment assistance is relevant to the workforce of America and minimum wage is just as relevant to the workforce of America. 
   If the majority leader would come out here and say, all right, I will let you have the agricultural amendment, or rather we should say we will have this agricultural amendment, and the distinguished Senator from Missouri, if he just calls up our minimum wage, and we will agree to 5 minutes to a side, and 10 minutes, and vote. They don't want to vote. They want the political cover of parliamentary maneuver, acting as if it is serious here, and we could work this out, and this is a big responsibility on my leader, but we have to listen to both sides, and we have to be able to move legislation. 
   We are not going to move any minimum wage. We are not going to move any campaign finance reform. Even though they are relevant? 
   Time magazine came out day before yesterday and said it is relevant. They wrote a whole article. I refer again to pages 50 and 51. Everybody can read it. 
   Campaign finance reform is relevant. There isn't any question on this particular bill. The magazines are writing it, but the Senators can't see it. The Parliamentarians can't understand it. They couldn't call that relevant because why? Because the majority leader says you don't call that relevant. You don't call that agricultural amendment of the Senator from Minnesota relevant, but call mine: Look I have come all the way back to the floor and withdrawn my part of the tree, and put up immediately my friend's amendment on agriculture, and yes, it's relevant. We are going to be represented in agriculture. I can tell you now, but  they are going to have some bureaucracy. And that could be a good speaking point when I run for reelection myself. I hate to have to explain why I have to oppose this to my farmer friends because that is going to cause the farm problem in America, as if we didn't have a special Trade Representative with the title of ambassador. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee for finally removing that sandwich bowl. I didn't get over there and see it in the debate. But I see they have, these folks who are interested in textile jobs: the Bank of America, Bechtel, City Group, Daimler-Chrysler, Enro, Exxon, Fleur, and Gap that we have on the list of the Time magazine which is going overseas. They have gone over. Sara Lee and Fruit of the Loom. Actually Fruit of the Loom is already organized in the Cayman Islands as a foreign corporation. McDonalds just sells hamburgers. They wouldn't care if you came naked to buy a hamburger. Modern Africa Fund Managers, Philip Morris, Amoco, Bally's Lakeshore Resort--come on--Mobile, Occidental, Texaco. Where is anybody? The African Growth and Opportunity Act is not clear. 
   I could keep on talking down and down the list. 
   I don't know who is going to protect the jobs and the manufacturing capacity of the United States of America. I don't believe in obstructionism. I believe in moving forward. I 
   don't believe there is, other than budget, a more important issue than the matter of manufacturing capacity here in the United States of America, on which I have gone down before and will go again. But there is no doubt we will have the opportunity to point out how we are losing out. We don't have anything to export. We have hollowed out the industrial might of the United States. 
   The reason they don't listen, I take it now, is they have a candidate for the President who is mixing that in with Hitler and World War II and everything else and all kinds of nonsense. So we lose credibility. Anybody can talk free trade, free trade, dignified, credible, respected, and anybody who talks about protection of the industrial strength of America is some kind of kook. I think they said, ``Unite, we nutcakes.'' Michael Kelly in his column this morning: ``Unite, we nutcakes.'' 
   So here comes another nutcake who is trying to protect American jobs, and is looked upon now by the leadership as getting in the way. Why don't I be more reasonable, and everything else of that kind? Why don't they be more reasonable? 
   Why don't they allow me to put up Shays-Meehan, which passed overwhelmingly, and for which we have a tremendous need? Why don't they let me put up the minimum wage, which is relevant to the trade adjustment assistance and welfare of the workers? They need it in America. 
   Why don't we agree to a time? We are not delaying--5 minutes to a side. We can vote this evening on both of those bills, and they can go to all of their appropriations bills that they want so we can get away from this so-called fill up the tree and fast track on this trade bill. They have fast track. They know it. Don't come out and complain and say: We would like to have gotten fast track. Parliamentarily, they have instituted fast tack. That is the position they put the Senator from South Carolina in, and those in international trade. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me commend our distinguished colleague from New Mexico. I had the privilege of visiting Corregidor about 30 years ago with Senator Montoya. We talked about the New Mexico National Guard. Most were lost who went through that dreadful experience. For those that survived--I lost a good friend, Jack Leonard, and other graduates who served in the New Mexico National Guard--this is a moment of history that should be noted in a more clear and reverent fashion. 
   I ask, please, to be added as a cosponsor to the Senator's bill.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself so much time as is allotted. 
   Mr. President, right to the point made by our distinguished chairman, the expression was used, ``meeting halfway.'' I am of the school that NAFTA did not work. But assuming it did work, it at least included the side agreements with respect to the environment, side agreements with respect to labor, and reciprocity with respect to the actual tariffs. This particular bill has no reciprocity, whether it be in the Caribbean--we are prepared now to list the various tariffs there, minding you that the United States average textile tariff is about 10 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is for the sub-Sahara. Later, when we have more time I will be delighted to list in there, too, what we have down in Nicaragua and Panama, and the other so-called Caribbean Basin Initiatives. 
   The truth of it is, in the initial observation of our distinguished chairman that this is going to give millions around the world a chance to seek their economic destiny, my problem is it is going to sink the economic destiny of the United States, particularly in the textile field, as it were, and many other fields as we set the case for so-called free trade. 
   I wish I had the time to emphasize the fact there is no such thing. Starting with Alexander Hamilton, in the earliest days of David Ricardo and comparative advantage, and just after the fledgling colonies had won their independence, that the Brits corresponded with Alexander Hamilton saying now what you should do is trade best with what you produce and we will trade back from the mother country with what we produce best. In a little booklet, ``Reports On Manufacturers''--there is one copy left there at the Library of Congress--Alexander Hamilton, in a line said: Bug off. We are not going to remain your colony. We are not going to continue to ship our wheat and our corn and our coal and our timber, our natural resources, like some kind of infant republic, and let you have the manufacturing strength. 
   As a result, on the 4th day of July, 1789, the second bill to pass the National Congress after we had adopted the Resolution for the Seal of the United States, the second bill was a tariff bill of 50 percent covering some 60 articles. We built this economic giant with protectionism. 
   We maintain certain protections, oh, yes, we make sure we protect intellectual property, you know, that brainy crowd, that Microsoft crowd that has 22,000 employees who are all millionaires; 22,000 millionaires working for you. I wish I were one of them. That is a wonderful situation, when you have all that manpower. But the real strength of our democracy is our middle class. Henry Ford said: Pay them enough so they can buy what they are producing. That is how we develop, with our manufacturing strength, this industrial power, the United States of America. 
   Now there is a zeal for continuing foreign aid as foreign trade. This is not a trade bill, it is an aid bill. It is unilateral. It is a one-way street. It is not even like NAFTA. There are not any side agreements whatever, yet you do not find some of our leaders in the environment and in labor. I know not why the chairman mentioned ATMI. No one has worked more intimately with ATMI than myself, until we got to NAFTA. Then the fabric boys said: The dickens with you apparel boys, we are going for broke. Certain it is they can sew down in Mexico as well as they do in the United States. That is your problem. Our problem is, with all this fine manufacturing, where we can produce the fabrics and continue to make a fortune. 
   So they just dropped their political strength. As the principal author of five textile bills that passed in this Senate in the last 30 years or more, I know better than any that we have the votes from up in the Northeast. The apparel boys--Saul Chaikin would turn over in his grave at this particular bill. Herman Staorbin, Jack Sheinkman--real leaders. I don't know where they are today. I cannot find them around. They seem to go along with foreign aid, export some more jobs. Yes, under NAFTA, we lost 420,000 textile jobs. The chairman is quoting ATMI that it is going to produce 121,000 jobs. That is pure poppycock. I make a bet on it. Let him bet on his words, any odds he wants and I will cover the bet. I can tell you here and now there is no chance of creating the jobs. This is a one-way export of jobs. 
   That Finance Committee comes around and says: Exports, exports, we have to emphasize exports. We do not have anything left to export. We are not exporting any software. We are not exporting the computers or anything else such as that. We had to 
   put in Semitech to save the semiconductor industry. They talk about aid and subsidies and everything else--oh, they are all for themselves but they are not for working Americans. 
   It is unique. Here I am--I voted for the right-to-work law and I am a strong supporter at the State level, not at the Federal level; I want my advantage down there in South Carolina because that is how we are getting a lot of good industry there; I want that individual decision--but this so-called conservative southern Governor is now having to protect organized labor when there is no one around this morning at all. There is no voice to be heard to save the jobs up there in the Northeast or anywhere else. 
   This is a sad occasion. Let me try to list some of those things we have imported now, from the Center of Domestic Consumption, the various products there, to show you exactly where we are. With respect to the machinery sector--48.9 percent of the machinery sector is represented in imports. I know with respect to textiles it is over 66 and two-thirds. 
   I told the Members on Friday we were alarmed when it reached 10-percent import penetration in textiles. Now two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported; 86 percent of the shoes. I know with respect to electronic products it is 57.9 percent. 
   It is sad. We invented the radio and electronics, and the Japanese have taken over in those areas. These things are too detailed to put in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I will have a better listing. Sometimes when you try to get information, you get so much information it is totally useless. 
   My point is, the strength and security of the United States of America is like a three-legged stool: One leg is our values as a nation. That is unquestioned. Everyone knows America will commit in Somalia and help bring about freedom and democracy in Bosnia. As we travel the world as Senators, we see we are the envy of the world with respect to individual rights, freedom of mankind, and equal justice under law. They all acknowledge that. We do not have to worry about that leg. 
   The other leg, of course, is the military leg or military power. As the one remaining superpower, that is unquestioned. 
   But the third leg, the economic leg, has been fractured. We have had foreign aid. It worked. This Senator is not complaining about it. I am making a factual observation as to where we are. Yes, we started after World War II and taxed ourselves some $85 billion for the Marshall Plan. We sent over our machinery, the best of our machinery, the best of minds, the technology, the managers, and capitalism has conquered communism in the Pacific rim and in Europe. We continued. 
   I will never forget, as a Governor, they said: Governor, come on, what do you expect these recovering and emerging nations to make, airplanes and computers? We will make the airplanes and computers, and they will make the shoes and the clothing. My problem today is, they are making the shoes, they are making the clothing, they are making the computers, and they are making the airplanes. They are dumping them. 
   We are finally getting the attention of the Senators from Washington and Boeing. They are beginning to understand. I have had their opposition over many years with respect to trade because they like the Federal Government, in defense, doing all their research, they like the Federal Government putting in the Eximbank to subsidize their sales overseas. We never had subsidized sales for textiles. They love all of that. Then they said: Oh, we have to get to work; we have a global economy, competition, competition. 
   The textile industry--look at the record--for 15 years has reinvested an average of $2 billion a year modernizing. I told the story of the Clinton plant the other day. It is 100 years old. It looks like from the outside it will fall down, but it has the most modern machinery. There was no one in the card room. Where they once had 125 in the weave room, there are no more than 15. They have mechanized, computerized, and electronically controlled operations. 
   Those companies that have survived are the most productive, competitive textile industry in the entire world. Our problem is, it is not going to pay to invest and continue to compete and survive for the plain and simple reason that this one-way street of foreign aid--I wish it were going to aid those countries.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember our friend John Chafee. The state of Rhode Island and the United States have lost a great man--a valiant soldier, a dedicated statesman and a gentleman of a breed we don't see enough of these days. 
   I always felt an affinity with John because our political careers followed similar paths. Like me, he returned from military service overseas and soon began his political career in his home state of Rhode Island, eventually serving as Governor and then as a United States Senator. 
   The courage and integrity that earned John accolades in the Marine Corps marked his tenure in the Senate, where he stood up for issues he believed in, no matter the opposition, and worked to break gridlock between Democrats and Republicans and forge partnerships amid partisanship. He knew when to be a leader in his party and when to be a loner, and most people respected him dearly for it. A former Secretary of the Navy, he steered his own course. 
   Environmentalists will remember John Chafee as their chief Republican ally, a man whose vision led to the crafting of numerous pieces of key legislation, including the 1988 law against ocean dumping, the 1989 oil spill law and most notably the Clean Air Act of 1990. More recently, he led successful efforts to enact oil spill prevention and response legislation and a bill to strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act. His years of commitment to the protection of the nation's wetlands and barrier islands are also tributes to his environmental legacy. 
   John had many visions, one of which was providing all Americans with comprehensive health care. His hard work in drafting a Republican health care package and pushing for a bipartisan compromise will not be forgotten. Neither will his efforts to expand health care coverage for women and children, improve community services for persons with disabilities and reduce the federal budget deficit. 
   Democrats and Republicans alike in John's home state of Rhode Island knew they had a friend in their Senator. He fought for local issues with  the same vigor as national ones. When he announced this March that he would not seek a fifth Senate term in 2000, he became emotional as he explained, ``I want to go home.'' In many ways I think John has gone home, in that he took his deep love of Rhode Island and its residents with him as he left this earth on Sunday. 
   As a Marine, John Chafee followed the motto ``Semper Fi,'' or ``always faithful.'' He carried that motto with him throughout his life. He was always faithful to his state, his country and his family. I will miss him and his statesmanship on the Senate floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the objections I have registered to the motion to proceed to the CBI/sub-Sahara bill, I was delighted to hear the chairman of our Finance Committee relate the reason for it. The reason, perhaps, is well-founded: good foreign policy. 
   I have sponsored and recommended some kind of Marshall Plan for the country of Mexico for the simple reason that Mexico is our neighbor; it is our friend. We have a responsibility to assist it, and we are responsible for the problems NAFTA has caused, which are quite obvious with respect to immigration and drugs. If we can put in a plan where Mexican workers can have workers' rights and some money in the economy would not be stripped and sent back to the bankers in New York or to the investment wizards from all the other countries, including the United States--you can cross from California into Tijuana, Mexico; one would think you were in Seoul, Korea. If we could do that, we could have some prosperous parity with our friends in Mexico. 
   Unfortunately, we went the so-called NAFTA way. We have had approximately 5 years to measure the success or failure of NAFTA. Everywhere I go I hear: Oh, isn't it wonderful how well it has worked. 
   The truth is, they told us in the original instance this was going to create jobs in America, just as the distinguished Senator from Delaware is telling me this bill is going to create jobs in the United States. 
   It is a win-win situation, he says, from the farmer to the apparel manufacturer. And he goes down the list: What a wonderful win-win situation it is. 
   I do not advise that he come to South Carolina and tell them that, where they have lost 31,700 textile jobs since NAFTA. They are streaming out. Why? Because you and I, Mr. President, set the American standard of living. That is a bipartisan effort whereby we all agree on a minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave, clean air, clean water--on down the list. We can continue to list Republicans and Democrats joining in setting our highest standard of living. 
   Obviously, it is competing with one of the lower standards of living. You can go down to Mexico for 58 cents an hour. There are none of those protections. You are guaranteed a profit. And everybody is streaming down there. 
   But we are losing jobs not just in South Carolina but all over the Nation. The overall job loss is in the textile and apparel sector over the last twenty five years is some 1.2 million, and 420,000 of them are textile jobs since NAFTA. They said we were going to get 200,000 new jobs. We have lost 420,000. They said, oh, it was going to solve the immigration problem. I know better--by handling the immigration appropriations--there is the Border Patrol, and how we are breaking out abandoned Navy yards and using schools, and having thousands of additional agents, and everything else of that kind, and illegal immigrants keep coming. The immigration problem is worse today than it was 4 or 5 years ago. 
   Drugs? Heavens above. There is a drug culture. You have to break it. You don't break it with NAFTA. It is worse today than it was 4 to 5 years ago. Even the Mexican worker is taking home less pay than he was taking home 5 years ago. 
   So there is no education in the second kick of a mule. When they come around and say, let's spread this NAFTA approach elixir and spread that down to the rest of the countries over to the sub-Sahara, or any elsewhere else in the world, we say, now, wait up. 
   Of course, if you listen to my distinguished colleague, he talks about the 48 sub-Sahara African countries. Certainly they are for it. They are for foreign aid. The retailers and wholesalers, and so forth, they get lower costs. Yes; there isn't any question about that. You can produce it for 58 cents an hour--no clean air, no clean water, child labor, and everything else of that kind in these countries abroad. That is a given, known fact. We have college students, who know better, demonstrating against that. Everybody knows it. We want to make it an official policy? 
   They say: From the farmer to the apparel manufacturer, and on, it is a win-win situation. Well, of course, unfortunately, it is a losing situation. As I have indicated, we have been through this singsong. 
   It started some 40 years ago or more with Japan. I will never forget, at the particular time I was a young Governor in South Carolina, they said: Now, Governor, what do you expect these emerging countries to make? The airplanes and the computers? Let us make the airplanes and computers, and let them make the textiles, the clothing, and the shoes. 
   The trouble is, 40 years later, with our noncompetitive blind kind of foreign trade policy, they are making the shoes, they are making the textiles, they are making the airplanes, they are making the computers, they are  making everything. When we get into full debate on Monday, we will point out and list down exactly what has been going on and how we have been hollowing out the industrial strength of America. 
   Last evening, we had a delightful exchange with the ranking member of our Finance Committee, the senior Senator from New York,

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my friend, Evelyn Dubrow, who recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Unfortunately, a previous commitment prevented me from joining Evy's many friends and admirers at the ceremony, but I want to commend her on receiving the nation's highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States Government. 
   President Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in 1963 to honor persons who have made  especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant private or public endeavors. There is not a more deserving recipient of this award than Evy Dubrow. As founder of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and Americans for Democratic Action, she tackled difficult issues from fair trade to civil rights. As legislative director of UNITE and its predecessor, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, Evy spent her career fighting not only for labor rights, but for individual rights and humanity. She is by far one of the best I have had the pleasure to know and to work with.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, it is an agreed fact among our colleagues in the Senate there is no member more steeped in history and erudite in its intellectual history than our distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree with him absolutely with respect to Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act and a variety of initiatives made since that time. 
   I have to oppose the motion because I am the one who objected, of course, to this so-called sub-Sahara/CBI bill. 
   One, with respect to Smoot-Hawley, it did not cause the depression and World War II. I want to disabuse anybody's mind from that particular suggestion. The stock market crash occurred in October 1929, and Smoot-Hawley was not passed until 8 months later in June of 1930. 
   At that particular time, slightly less than 1 percent of the GNP was in international trade. It is now up to 17 percent. At that time trade did not have that big an effect on the GNP or the economy of the United States itself. True, Germany, Europe, and everybody else was in a depression, and we entered the depression as a result of the crash. 
   Along came Cordell Hull. I want to emphasize one concept: the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934; reciprocity; not foreign aid but foreign trade; a thing of value for an exchange of value. We learned that in Contracts 101 as lawyers. 
   Somehow over the past several years we have gotten into ``we have to do something.'' We are the most powerful Nation militarily and economically; perhaps not the richest. We do not have the largest per capita income. We are down to about No. 8 or 9. We are not the richest, but we are very affluent comparatively speaking. 
   The urge is there, and I understand that urge to want to help, but we gave at the office. Let me tell you when I gave at the office, for my textile friends. 
   We have been giving and giving and giving. We had a hearing before the International Trade Commission. It was the Eisenhower administration at that particular time. I came to testify as the Governor of South Carolina. The finding was in June of 1960. It was in early March of 1960. I was chased around the room by none other than Tom Dewey. He was a lawyer for the Japanese. They were not a concern at the particular time. Ten percent of textiles consumed in America was being imported, and if we went beyond the 10 percent, it was determined that it would devastate the economy, particularly the textile economy of the United States of America. 
   I am looking around this room, and I can tell you that over two-thirds--that is a 2-year-old figure; I bet it is up to 70 percent--but two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at, not 10 percent, is imported. 
   When I say we gave at the office again and again--I can go to Desert Storm, and I will do that, and how we gave Turkey a couple of billion dollars in increased textile imports, how we bought this crowd off, and every time we have a crisis, whatever it is, we give to people who ask for our help. 
   My point is, at that particular time, I left that hearing. I had a good Republican friend who knew President Eisenhower. We checked in with Jerry Parsons. I can still see him in the outer office. He said: The Chief can see you now. We went in and saw President Eisenhower and he was committed to helping the textile industry. But by June, it had gone the other way. 
   As a young Democratic southern Governor, I said: I am going to try that fellow Kennedy. I had never been with him, but I came up in August and sat down with Mike Feldman. He is still alive and can verify this. He was legislative assistant to John F. Kennedy. I can show my colleagues the office in the old Russell Building. We sat down and agreed that I will write this letter as a Governor and Senator Kennedy will write back because being from Massachusetts, he understood the desperate nature of the textile economy at that time. We exchanged letters. I will have to get that letter because our revered leader of that particular administration was, of course, and is still revered now, the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. He knows this more intimately than I, but I know this particular part of it. 
   We sat down and agreed because there was a national security provision. Before the President could take executive action, there 
   had to be a finding that a particular commodity was important to the national security of the United States of America. We got the Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg, Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary McNamara of Defense, and Doug Dillon, Secretary of the Treasury. He was most interested. I sat down and talked with Secretary Dillon. He was fully briefed from my northern textile friends. 
   Incidentally, the Northern Textile Association met last weekend down in my hometown with Karl Spilhaus. Bill Sullivan previously ran the organization. 
   We brought in witnesses. We had hearings. And about April 26 they made a finding. Steel was the most important industry to our national economy and second most important to our national security was textiles. We could not send our soldiers to war in a Japanese uniform, and I used to add to that, and Gucci shoes. 
   Eighty-six percent of the shoes in this Chamber today are imported. The shoe industry is practically gone. Textiles are about gone, and Washington is telling them: You have to get high-tech, high-tech, global economy, global competition, retrain--it sounds like Mao Tse-tung running around reeducating the people, getting them skills. 
   We are closing down our knitting mills, one in particular was the Oneida  Mill. They made T-shirts. They had 487 employees. The average age was 47. 
   Tomorrow morning, let's say we have done it Washington's way, we have reeducated and trained the 487 employees, and now they are skilled computer operators. Are you going to hire a 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer operator? You are not going to take on those health costs; you are not going to take on those retirement costs. 
   The little town of Andrew, SC, is high and dry, as are many other towns with so-called low unemployment, low inflation. Since NAFTA, South Carolina has lost 31,700 textile jobs. The reason I know that figure is because I talked with the Northern Textile Association last weekend. I am briefed on this particular subject. 
   What we have in the CBI/sub-Sahara--the intent is good, to help--but we cannot afford any longer to give away these critical industries important to our national security. 
   Specifically, I was with Akio Morita in Chicago in the early eighties. He was talking about the Third World developing and the developing countries. He said they must develop a strong manufacturing capacity in order to become a nation state. 
   Later on he said ``And by the way, Senator, the world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.'' 
   Look at the back page of the U.S. News & World Report of last week, and the comments our friend Mort Zuckerman. You can see we are getting a divided society. We are losing those middle-class jobs. Henry Ford said: I want my workers to make enough to be able to buy what they are making. And our strong manufacturing economy has been drained overnight. 
   I will bring a list of the particular items, including textiles where import penetration is high. So when you get and look at the CBI, and you look at the sub-Sahara, it is NAFTA without--and I don't think NAFTA worked at all--without the advantages of NAFTA; namely, the side agreements on the environment, the side agreements on labor, the reciprocity. There is no reciprocity. If we are going to let their products come in duty free, we should tell them to lower their tariffs. 
   So this is a bad bill, to begin with. It should not have passed, almost unanimously, in that Finance Committee. They ought to look at these things more thoroughly. But the point is, we have to maintain these manufacturing jobs. 
   I can remember when I was a child--and I know the distinguished Senator from New York would remember--the last call for breakfast, Don McNeil and ``Breakfast Club'' up there in Chicago. 
   I feel like this is sort of the last call tonight for my textile friends. We will get into it more thoroughly because it isn't just the textile people. The truth is, I didn't carry Anderson, Greenville, and Spartanburg Counties, which have all the textile votes. They are going to be voting--you watch them--for George W. Bush. They have already made up their mind. They don't care about the campaign. We had them going Democratic only one time since Kennedy, and that was just momentarily for Jimmy Carter. We gave Barry Goldwater more votes, in the 1964 race, than he got in Arizona; percentage-wise and number-wise, both.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes. Barry used to love to kid me about that. So I know from whence I am coming. It is just that it is terrible to see this thing happen all around you. And the new, jobs and all the so-called new employment is going into retailing, and they are getting paid next to nothing. They will not even assume the health costs and everything else of that kind. So it is a real issue. 
   And they always do this to me. They did NAFTA right at the end of the session. Then on GATT, I had to make them come back after the election. Now we have another 10 days, and they want to raise it. And I have to make the same motion not to proceed. 
   I do appreciate the leadership and the brilliance of my leader, Senator MOYNIHAN, of our Finance Committee. I thank him for his courtesy. But I am going to have to continue to object to moving to consider and proceeding on this particular measure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my subcommittee chairman, Senator GREGG, in presenting to the Senate the fiscal year 2000, Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related agencies appropriations conference report. I would like to thank Senator GREGG for his efforts in resolving many of the difficult issues that were encompassed in this bill. As a result of over four weeks of negotiations, the conference report before the Senator today--for the most past--is good and balanced. 
   As Senator GREGG stated, this agreement includes $39 billion and exceeds last year's appropriation by almost $3 billion. While this sounds like a tremendous increase in funding, for all intent and purpose, this increase is for the 2000 decennial census. Consequently, the funding decisions encompassed in this bill were difficult. Senator GREGG has already covered many of the major issues in this bill so I will not go into great detail. But, I would like to point out to my colleagues some of the highlights of this bill: 
   The Justice Department accounts for the largest portion of this bill and contains $18.5 billion for many important law enforcement agencies including the FBI, DEA, INS, and Marshals Service. This level of funding is only an increase of $287 million above last year's appropriated level. Within DOJ, the conferees agreed to recede to the Senate's position the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, and funded the program at the Senate level of $325 million. In addition, $250 million in carryover is available bringing the total budget authority for this program for fiscal year 2000 to $575 million. While many of us would like to see a higher level of funding for this program, I believe that we have provided a responsible level given the austere funding constraints this year. 
   Mr. President, the conferees also agreed to continue the Safe Schools Initiative that Senator GREGG and I began funding last year. To further efforts in combating violence in and around our schools, we have included $225 million in funding. Included in that funding is $180 million for school resource officers and $30 million for prevention programs. 
   Regarding the Commerce Department, $8.7 billion is provided for the numerous missions undertaken by the various agencies of the Commerce Department, including stewardship of our nation's oceans and waterways, satellite coverage and weather forecasting, regulation of trade and telecommunications, assistance to rural areas, high risk technology research, and assistance to small manufacturers. Also within this level of funding for the Commerce Department is the $4.47 billion necessary for conducting the constitutionally mandated decennial census. I would like to thank Chairman GREGG for working to resolve the issues around census funding without lengthy and counter-productive debate. 
   I am pleased that the conference report reflects a level of funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that is closer to the Senate position that the House. NOAA is the premier agency for addressing catastrophic weather conditions as well as daily forecasts. This year has been one filled with natural disasters--everything from droughts, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. During this past month while our staff was negotiating on this bill, about 10 million people were evacuated from the coast during Hurricane Floyd. Thanks to NOAA's hurricane research, their flights into the storm their satellite coverage and weather forecasts, the loss of life, while still very tragic, was significantly less than what it otherwise would have been. Mr. President, when we went into conference 6 weeks ago, there was a $600 million difference in funding for NOAA between the House and Senate. The Senate worked diligently to restore NOAA's funding and the conference report reflects those efforts with NOAA funded at an increase of $137 million above last year's appropriated level. Given this agency's missions that include everything from weather forecasting and atmospheric research to ocean and fisheries research and ocean and coastal management, this level of funding in still insufficient, but given the fiscal constraints, it is enough to allow the agency to continue forward with its critical missions. 
   This conference report provides $5.9 billion for the Department of State and related agencies. This will fund security upgrades for State Department facilities, construction and maintenance of U.S. missions, payment of international organization and peacekeeping funds, and educational and cultural exchanges. This year we are providing $313.6 million in funding for much needed security upgrades at State Department facilities around the world. Incidents such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania have reminded us that we cannot dismiss the safety and security of our citizens abroad. 
   Now I would like to take a moment to thank the staff for all their hard work in bringing this agreement to the floor. Specifically I would like to thank Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Eric Harnischfeger, Clayton Heil, and Dana Quam of Senator GREGG's staff and Lila Helms, Emelie East, and Tim Harding of my staff. I know that they have all worked long hours during the past 4 weeks, including weekends and late evenings to reach a compromise and I appreciate their efforts. This a large bill that funds the Federal law enforcement, oceans and fisheries, our nations courts and everything in between. Reaching compromise on these myriad accounts is no small task and I thank them for their diligence. 
   Mr. President, I take this opportunity to give a few words of thanks to someone who has been a tremendous help to me and the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee over this last year. That person is Tim Harding, an extremely bright young man who was detailed to me by the Department of Justice COPS on the Beat program. 
   Tim worked with me and my staff since last winter. He has seen this process through--from receipt of the President's budget, to our congressional hearings, to markup, through our whirlwind day on the Senate floor, and through this month and a half of conference. At every point, Tim was willing and ready to give 100 percent. While we all know the Senate is like no other place, Tim took the time to learn what makes this process work, and he was able to easily adapt. He provided me with memos, helped me with my constituent relations, and drafted good-quality statements for my use during hearings, markup, and floor consideration of our bill. His work will be sorely missed by me and my staff, and I wish him all the best in what promises to be a bright future.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3036. This legislation is being considered to remedy language included in section 338 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000. Contained in the FY 2000 DOT Conference Report was a provision that prohibits the enforcement of civil penalties against truck and commercial vehicles for safety violations until separate legislation is passed to move motor carrier safety functions out of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The provision would also have the impact of eliminating authority to shut down unfit carriers who pose a serious threat to highway safety. 
   While it is the intent of the committee to mark up a bill this month, it does not make sense to hamstring the agency charged with regulating and enforcing safety until the legislative process has taken its course. H.R. 3036 passed the House last night under suspension of the rules and quick consideration by the Senate today will ensure that the enforcement authority for motor carriers will be restored to the DOT. As we consider authorizing legislation that will reorganize and reprioritize the functions of the Office of Motor Carriers, this legislation will enable the federal government to continue to enforce important federal truck safety rules. 
   This bill is fair in that it provides authority to DOT to continue to levy penalties until we finalize legislation on this matter. There are pending bills in both bodies, it would be premature to change the functions of this critical safety agency prior to the completion of properly considered legislation.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to recognize today the congregation of Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim in Charleston, S.C. as it celebrates its 250th anniversary on October 23 1999. 
   Beth Elohim is the fourth oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. The congregation still worships in a synagogue built in 1840-41 in the Greek Revival style, making it the oldest synagogue in continuous use in the United States. In 1980, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark. 
   Jewish settlers arrived in Charleston as early as 1695 and by 1749 were numerous enough to organize the present congregation of Beth Elohim, then known as Holy Congregational House of God. These settlers were attracted by South Carolina's civil and religious liberty as well as the economic opportunities the colony offered. In 1792, construction of the synagogue began. The structure stood until being destroyed in the Charleston fire of 1838. The visiting General Marquis de Lafayette observed the original building to be ``spacious and elegant.'' 
   Beth Elohim also holds the distinction of being the cradle of Reform Judaism in the United States. In 1824, a group of progressive members of the congregation petitioned for a shortened Hebrew ritual, English translation of prayers and a sermon in English. Their petition being denied, they decided to organize The Reformed Society of Israelites. It was a short-lived society, but when the members returned to the congregation at Beth Elohim, their practices and principles influenced the worship service there and today still form the basis of Reform Judaism. During the construction of the new temple in 1840, an organ was installed, encased in mahogany to complement the building's interior. Said to have 700 pipes and costing $2,500, the organ provided the first instrumental music used in worship in any synagogue in America. 
   Many members of K.K. Beth Elohim have been distinguished city, state and national leaders, including early congregant Moses Lindo, who before the Revolution helped to develop the cultivation of indigo. Joseph Levy, veteran of the Cherokee War of 1760-61, was probably the first Jewish military officer in America. Almost two dozen men of Beth Elohim served in the American Revolution, most notably Francis Salvador who, as a delegate to the South Carolina Provincial Congresses of 1775-1776, was one of the first Jews to serve in the American legislature. The blind poet Penina Moise was a famous early superintendent of the Jewish Sunday School at Beth Elohim. 
   Today, Beth Elohim is led by Rabbi Anthony David Holz and Rabbi Emeritus William A. Rosenthall. The congregation continues to function as a vital part of the Charleston community and deserves many congratulations on reaching this milestone--250 years of rich history.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill and I am pleased we will have this opportunity to consider the current state of the aviation industry and some of the enormous challenges facing our air transportation system over the next decade. I resisted efforts earlier this year to bypass Senate consideration of this major transportation bill and go directly to conference with the House when the Senate passed a short term extension bill for the Airport Improvement Program. We need to have a serious debate on the increasing demands for air transportation, the capital requirements for our future air transportation system, the availability of federal funding and whether the current structure of the aviation trust fund will meet those needs, and finally, the lack of competition and minimal service that most small and medium sized communities are faced with in this era of airline deregulation. 
   I want to commend Senators MCCAIN, ROCKEFELLER and GORTON for their hard work in resolving so many issues prior to bringing this bill to the floor. I am disturbed, however, by provisions in this bill which would force even more planes into an already jammed system in New York as well as Washington's National Airport. At a time when delays are at an all-time high, we continue to authorize more flights into and out of these already busy airports. I am even more perplexed at the timing of the current call to privatize our Air Traffic Control System. While certain segments of the industry support this effort, we often too quickly gravitate toward solutions such as privatization as cure all for whatever ails the system, instead of simply ensuring that the FAA has the tools and money it needs to do its job. 
   Aviation has become a global business and is an important part of the transportation infrastructure and a vital part of our national economy. Every day our air transportation system moves millions of people and billions of dollars of cargo. While many predicted that an economy based on advanced communications and technology would reduce our need for travel, the opposite has proved true. The U.S. commercial aviation industry recorded its fifth consecutive year of traffic growth, while the general aviation industry enjoyed a banner year in shipments and aircraft activity at FAA air traffic facilities. To a large extent, growth in both domestic and international markets has been driven by the continued economic expansion in the U.S. and most world economies. 
   The FAA Aerospace Forecasts Report, Fiscal Years 1999-2010, was issued in March of this year and forecasts aviation activity at all FAA facilities through the year 2010. The 12-year forecast is based on moderate economic growth and inflation, and relatively constant real fuel prices. Based on these assumptions, U.S. scheduled domestic passenger emplanements are forecast to increase 50.4 percent--air carriers increasing 49.3 percent and regional/commuters growing by 87.5 percent. Total International passenger traffic between the United States and the rest of the world is projected to increase 82.6 percent. International passenger traffic carried on U.S. Flag carriers is forecast to increase 94.2 percent. 
   These percentages represent a dramatic increase in the actual number of people using the air system, even when compared to the increase in air travel that occurred over the last ten years. Daily enplanements are expected to grow to more than 1 billion by 2009. In 2010, there will be 828 million domestic enplanements compared to last year's 554.6 million, and there will be 230.2 million international enplanements compared to today's figure of 126.1 million. Respectively, this represents an annual growth of 3.4% and 4.95% per year. Regional and commuter traffic is expected to grow even faster at the rate of 6.4%. Total enplanements in this category should reach 59.7 million in 2010. As of September 1997, there were 107 regional jets operating in the U.S. airline fleet. In the FAA Aviation Forecasts Fiscal years 1998-2009, the FAA predicts that there will be more than 800 of these in the U.S. fleet by FY2009. 
   Correspondingly, the growth in air travel has placed a strain on the aviation system and has further increased delays. In 1998, 23% of flights by major air carriers were delayed. MITRE, the FAA's federally-funded research and development organization, estimates that just to maintain delays at current levels in 2015, a 60% increase in airport capacity will be needed. As many of you may know, and perhaps experienced first hand, delays reached an all-time high this summer. These delays are inordinately costly to both the carriers and the traveling public; in fact, according to the Air Transport Association, delays cost the airlines and travelers $3.9 billion for 1997. 
   We cannot ignore the numbers. These statistics underscore the necessity of properly funding our investment--we must modernize our Air Traffic Control system and expand our airport infrastructure. In 1997, the National Civil Aviation Review Commission came out with a report stating the gridlock in the skies is a certainty unless the Air Traffic Control, ATC, system and National Air Space are modernized. A system-wide delay increase of just a few minutes per flight will bring commercial operations to a halt. American Airlines published a separate study confirming these findings. A third, done by the White House Commission on Aviation Security and Safety, dated January 1997 and commonly known as the Gore Commission, recommends that modernization of the ATC system be expedited to completion by 2005 instead of 2015. 
   Regrettably, as the need to upgrade and replace the systems used by our air traffic controllers grows, funding has steadily decreased since 1992. In FY '92 the Facilities and Equipment account was funded at $2.4 Billion. In l997, F&E was $l.938 Billion. In 1998, the account was funded at 1.901 billion. Assuming a conservative 2015 completion date, the modernization effort requires $3 billion per year in funding for the Facilities and Equipment Account alone, the  mainspring of the modernization effort. Unfortunately, S.82 authorizes $2.689 billion for FY2000 while the Appropriations Committee has provided only $2.075 billion. We are falling short every year and losing critical ground in the race to update our national air transportation system. 
   Increasing capacity through technological advances is crucial to the functionality of the FAA and the aviation industry. Today, a great deal of the equipment used by the Air Traffic Controllers is old and becoming obsolete. Our air traffic controllers are the front line defense and insure the safety of the traveling public every day by separating aircraft and guiding takeoffs and landings. Our lives and those of our families, friends, and constituents are in their hands. These controllers and technicians do a terrific job. The fact that their equipment is so antiquated makes their efforts even more heroic. 
   We have the funds to modernize our air facilities but refuse to spend them and by doing so Congress perpetuates a fraud on the traveling public. The Airport and Airways Trust Fund, AAF, was created to provide a dedicated funding source for critical aviation programs and the money in the fund is generated solely from taxes imposed on air travelers and the airline industry. The fund was created so that users of the air transportation system would bear the burden of maintaining and improving the system. The traveling public has continued to honor its part of the agreement through the payment of ticket taxes, but the federal government has not. 
   Congress has refused to annually appropriate the full amount generated in the trust fund despite the growing needs in the aviation industry. The surplus generated in the trust fund is used to fund the general operations of government, similar to the way in which Congress has used surplus generated in the Social Security trust fund. At the end of FY 2000, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that there will be a cash balance of $14.047 billion in the AATF, for FY2001, it will be $16.499 billion. By FY2009, the balance will grow to $71.563 billion. Instead of using these monies to fund the operation of the general government, we should use them to fund aviation improvements, which is what we promised the American public when we enacted and then increased the airline ticket tax. 
   Let's get our aviation transport system up to par and let's provide ways to increase competition and maintain our worldwide leadership in aviation. Let's follow the lead of Chairman SHUSTER and Congressman OBERSTAR and vote to take the Trust Fund off-budget. I look forward to a thoughtful debate on these issues and I intend to work with Senators MCCAIN, ROCKEFELLER, and GORTON to accomplish this common goal of ensuring that the safest and most efficient air transportation system in the world stays so.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator FRIST in introducing this bill to authorize the atmospheric programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Fire Administration, and the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) through FY 2002. These agencies are doing important work to protect public safety through prediction, education, and mitigation efforts. 
   This bill authorizes the ``dry'' side of NOAA, the Fire Administration, and NEHRP at the President's requested level for FY 2000. The Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill provided additional monies for the Weather Service and atmospheric research within NOAA, and Senator FRIST has agreed to revise this authorization bill during the Commerce Committee's consideration to reflect this additional support. 
   As many of you know, I have been trying to put the ``O'' back in NOAA for years, so it is interesting to be co-sponsoring a bill which authorizes only the ``dry'' side of NOAA. My support for the ``wet'' programs of NOAA has not waned. Senator FRIST, Senator BREAUX, and I have also been working with Senators KERRY and SNOWE to craft a bill which will authorize all of the programs of NOAA. 
   NOAA is doing some important work. We need only look at their superior warnings during and after Hurricane Floyd to see that the National Weather Service directly impacts the lives of Americans every day. Every weather report heard on the Weather Channel, CNN, and local affiliates was based on information provided by NOAA. The agency worked with emergency managers, the private sector, and the public to make sure that its predictions and warnings were heard and could save lives and property. 
   NOAA's atmospheric scientists are also at work to help us understand what our weather might be like not just next week but also next year or in the next decade. NOAA is trying to understand long-term climate change, as well as seasonal patterns like El Nin 6o and La Nin 6a. Meanwhile, NOAA's satellite operations keep our eyes in the sky in working order and help us understand and predict the path of large systems like hurricanes. 
   I especially appreciate the hard work that the Weather Service has undertaken in its modernization. While this is still a work in progress, NOAA has improved warning times and accuracy while undertaking a difficult streamlining process. I wonder if Congress may have asked NOAA to do too much with too little and am glad that the Weather Service has been able to fulfill its important mandate even where we might have cut too close to the bone. 
   Mr. President, while I hope each of us are benefitting from the forecasts and warnings of the Weather Service, I hope that far fewer of us have to interact with this nation's fire service. The United States has over 2 million fires annually. Each one can devastate a  family or business. I should know. This August I lost my home in Charleston, South Carolina. The statistics--approximately 4500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, more than $8 billion in direct property losses, and more than $50 billion in costs to taxpayers each year--do not tell the whole story. A fire can take away a lifetime of things that have true value only to the person who has suffered the loss. The tragic thing is that most of these fires are preventable. 
   The bill would authorize the United States Fire Administration which provides invaluable services--such as training, data, arson assistance, and research of better safety equipment and clothing--to the more than 1.2 million paid and volunteer firefighters throughout the nation. I hope the Fire Administration will work quickly to resolve the outstanding recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel so that they can once again focus on reducing losses from fire and meet new challenges like medical emergencies, hazardous spills, and even acts of terrorism. The Strategic Plan called for in Section 302 of the bill should lay out a road map for this process. 
   Finally, the bill would authorize the programs of the NEHRP. While most people only think of California as having earthquakes, all or parts of 39 states--populated by more than 70 million people--have been classified as having major or moderate seismic risk. In 1886, an earthquake leveled my hometown of Charleston. Estimates of the strength of the Charleston quake range from 7.0 to 7.6 on the Richter Scale. Of particular interest and concern about east coast quakes is that there is no known geological origin for them. This fact underscores the possibility of unpredictable seismic activity in the United States. 
   What we do know though is that the loss of life and property from earthquakes can be considerable. That is what NEHRP is here for. It is a Federal interagency program--with participation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geological Service, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology--designed to help minimize the loss of life and property caused by earthquakes. It is supports scientific research on the origins of earthquakes, and funds engineering research to make buildings and other structures more seismically resistant. NEHRP also disseminates this technical information to the states and helps states and localities prepare for earthquakes. NEHRP focuses on helping states prepare for earthquakes, in contrast to Federal disaster response programs that help states after a major event. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion the public safety programs authorized in this bill--the Weather Service, fire safety, and earthquake preparedness--protect the lives and property of every American citizen. Protecting public safety is one of the first and most important functions of government, and I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting these programs and this bill.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to recognize today one of South Carolina's finest public servants, Judge Lewis Stith. August 1 marked Mr. Stith's 43d year of continued service to the town of Sullivan's Island. 
   A native of Sullivan's Island, Mr. Stith and his wife, Marguerite, raised their five children there after he returned from service in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. He later served in the Korean war. 
   In 1956, Lewis Stith was appointed a Charleston County magistrate, a position he held for 25 years. In 1981, he was appointed municipal judge of Sullivan's Island, a position he still holds. Judge Stith's civic accomplishments are numerous and include helping to organize the Sullivan's Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department 51 years ago.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, over the August recess South Carolina lost one of her most distinguished native sons, Lane Kirkland. Unless you knew Lane personally, you weren't likely to know he was a proud South Carolinian. If you did know him personally, there was no way not to know he was a proud South Carolinian. He went to South Carolina regularly; sometimes to see his brothers Ranny and Tommy, sometimes just to go to the wonderful small town of Camden where he spent his childhood summers. Whenever we would meet, officially or not, we always spent some time talking about South Carolina. 
   Lane remembered and cherished his roots, but they did not bind him. He had grown up with people who could not see through their rich heritage to the future. Lane was acutely aware of this trap and he illustrated this brilliantly in a commencement address to the University of South Carolina in 1985.  
   I owe to Sidney Hook a thought that I offer as my final conclusion from all this. From him I learned the difference between a truth and a deep truth. A deep truth is a truth the converse of which is equally true. For example, it is true, as Santayana said, that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Yet it is equally true that those who do remember the past may not know when it is over. That is a deep truth.  
   Lane Kirkland was a complex person as evidenced by his many contradictions. He was a Southerner who found his education and opportunity in New York; he descended from planters but had his first success as a sea captain; he was a child of privilege who became a self-described New Dealer; he was an intellectual who fought for miners and mill workers; and perhaps most importantly, he was a liberal anti-Communist. 
   Lane had many triumphs in his life, but none was so important as the leading role he played in the liberation of Eastern Europe and the fall of the wall. He committed the resources of the American labor movement to preserve Lech Walesa and Solidarity. The New York Post wrote that ``Kirkland must be included among a select group of leaders--including Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and Lech Walesa--who played a critical role in bringing about the demise of Communism.'' William Safire, no fan of organized labor, wrote this about Lane Kirkland and Lech Walesa: ``Together these two anti-Communist patriots fought the Soviet empire when the weak-kneed were bleating `convergence'. Their refusal to compromise with evil exemplified the leadership that helped win--the word is `win'--the cold war.'' 
   As a South Carolinian and an American, I am proud of the central role that Lane played in the central struggle of this century. People in the United States and around the world know the exhilaration and opportunity that freedom brings in part because of  Lane Kirkland. In his last speech in South Carolina, Lane addressed the South Carolina Historical Society. He opened by saying, ``I am honored to be here even though it suggests that I am history.'' In reality Lane Kirkland made history.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday the Republican majority continued to try and create a strategy to embarrass President Clinton and those Members of Congress that opposed the so-called tax-cut bill. I found their strategy quite ironic that while this country is less than 20 days away from the end of a fiscal year when the U.S. Government will spend more than $100 billion than it takes in that the Republicans are insisting on giving tax  breaks to the rich that the country cannot afford. 
   William Greider, a former assistant managing editor of the Washington Post and now National Editor for Rolling Stone, explains the issue of the phantom surplus very well in an article headlined ``The Surplus Fallacy.'' 
   Mr. Greider has done a great job in explaining that there is no surplus, there is no money to give a tax break with, and more importantly, this country spends more than it takes in each year. I think this article should be required reading for any Member of Congress that has to vote on a federal budget in the next two months so they may understand where this country really stands fiscally.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the renomination by the President of Linda J. Morgan to another term with the Surface Transportation Board, and his express intention to re-designate her as Chairman.  Linda Morgan, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for several years, has been Chairman of the Board and its predecessor, the Interstate Commerce Commission, since 1995. Many times before, I have publicly praised the outstanding job she has done in steering the Board and the transportation sector through some very rough seas. Her intellect, knowledge, competence and experience continue to be indispensable to the resolution of the many issues that confront this key segment of the economy. And she has exhibited the kind of integrity, fairness, spirit, and work ethic that are essential to the proper exercise of the Board's important adjudicative functions. 
   With this reappointment, the Senate has the opportunity to approve a first-rate leader and public servant--one of the best and brightest. I know that I will have the cooperation of all of my colleagues on the Commerce Committee and in the full Senate in expeditiously moving this outstanding nomination through to confirmation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a project that the Senate has been working on for over two decades, the Congaree Swamp National Monument. When this National Monument was established in 1976, its purpose was to educate present and future generations. Mr. President, through the leadership of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, we have come a long way. In FY'98, funding was provided to build and pave a new entrance road and with FY'99 funds, the park's first visitor facility, a 10,300 sq. ft. education and administration facility is near completion. The total estimated cost for these two projects was $5.814 million. Through a partnership with the National Guard, Richland County, and a local non-profit organization these projects will be built for a total cost of $2.16 million. That is a savings of $3.65 million to the American tax payer. 
   Now that a new administration facility is close to being completed, we face the difficult task of providing adequate staffing levels at the Congaree National Monument. Increased staffing levels are needed at this monument to ensure safety and to provide education to the increasing number of park visitors. While I know earmarking operational funds for specific park sites is not the best course of action, I do want to bring to light the problem that this National Monument will be facing in the near future. In 1996, an on-site operations review by seven Atlantic Coast Cluster Superintendents concluded that ``the [park's] staffing level is inadequate to provide minimum resource protection and visitor services''. The report continued with the statement that ``the park staff, with considerable support from an excellent volunteer cadre, is doing a valiant job of operating the park to the best of their ability, but lack the same breadth of resources and facilities in other National Park Service sites. *.*.* '' More than 300-school group program requests were denied last year because of the lack of staff. A large percentage of park visitors leave without learning the significance of the park due to the lack of programs. The shortage of staff will become even more critical with completion of the new infrastructure and increased visitation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the opening of the 1999 tobacco marketing season in my home state of South Carolina. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States is one of the world's leading producers of tobacco. It is second only to China in total tobacco production. Tobacco is the seventh largest U.S. crop, with over 130,000 tobacco farms in the United States. 
   In South Carolina, tobacco is the top cash crop, worth about $200 million annually. It also generates over $1 billion in economic activity for my state. Tobacco production is responsible for more than 40,000 jobs on over 2,000 farms and continues to account for about one-fourth of all crops and around 13 percent of total crop and livestock agriculture in South Carolina. 
   It has been a hard couple of years for tobacco farmers in my state. Last year, a settlement between the State Attorneys General and five tobacco companies was completed. This settlement has created insecurity in these farmers' lives, as well as in their communities. Once again tobacco quota was cut this year. The cut was 17 percent, which means that these farmers have seen their quota reduced by 35 percent over the last 2 years. 
   In recent years, we have seen a rise in tobacco imports, as domestic purchases by companies have declined. This has had a direct effect on the economy of my state. Many of the rural towns in South Carolina have grown up around producing tobacco, and decreased demand for domestic tobacco has affected them greatly. I hope these companies see the need to purchase more domestic tobacco and decrease the amount of tobacco they import. It is imperative for these rural communities' economic stability that domestic tobacco purchases rise. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion I want to wish the tobacco farmers and warehousemen in South Carolina the best of luck this year. I wish that I could be down in South Carolina for this festive occasion of opening day, but duty calls. Although I can't be there physically, they all know that I'm there in spirit. And as hard as I have worked in the past for them, they can expect me to work even harder to ensure farmers and their communities remain economically sound.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator LEVIN, and myself, I move to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions that the committee report back within 3 days with an amendment that implements the Greenspan recommendations by deferring tax reductions and by taking any projected revenue surplus and actually reducing the national debt. 
   Now, for days on end we have been talking about what Mr. Greenspan said here, what Mr. Greenspan said here. As our friend, the former Attorney General Mitchell said: Watch what we do, not what we say. 
   He has been trying to stay the course; namely, just take, in a sense, any surpluses--don't argue about them, but if you can find them, then apply that to reducing the national debt. So often we say that all of us want to go to heaven but we don't want to do what is necessary to get there. All of us say we want to reduce or pay down the national debt, but we don't want to do what is necessary to get there. All you have to do in order to get there or reduce the debt is vote for this motion. 
   I yield to Senator LIEBERMAN.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   Let me just say quickly to clear the Record that the Senator from Texas was talking about what the Republicans have done for the economy. 
   I can tell you what they have done for the economy. They came in 1995, and for 1996 they worked, of course, on the budget. They immediately increased spending for the next year of $148 billion. They increased spending, and the budget went up another $50 billion. This year, of course, it is another $50 billion, and they have added. The track record will show that they have added $661 billion to the national debt. 
   But what did President Clinton do in 1993? And we did not have the largest tax increase. That was under Senator Dole. I will show the articles analyzing both. 
   But I readily acknowledge that I voted and supported and worked like a tiger to get the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993 passed, which prevailed by one vote. Yes, we did cut spending, we did downsize over 300,000 Federal jobs. But more than anything else, yes, we raised taxes. 
   The Senator from Texas, when we raised the taxes on Social Security, was adamantly opposed to that, and he said--I will use his expression--you increase taxes on Social Security and they will hunt you Democrats down in the streets and shoot you like dogs. 
   The Senator from South Carolina never forgot that expression. That is how tough we had it. They were going to hunt us down. 
   Of course, the chairman of the Finance Committee at that time, Senator Packwood, said, ``I will give you my home if this thing works.'' The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. KASICH, said, ``I will change parties and become a Democrat if this thing works.'' And it is working. 
   That is a tremendous frustration I have because it is working. We have the lowest unemployment, the lowest inflation, and the economy is moving along. Mr. Greenspan, not just on yesterday but earlier in the year, in February, said stay the course.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one sentence of his commentary: ``We can fairly call the House legislation the most outrageous tax package in the last 50 years.'' 
   That is why I come to the floor to speak. I agree with Mr. Phillips. This tax bill turns everything on its backside when we have a good going economy, and the Republicans come in with, of all things, a tax cut. How come? I will tell Members exactly. I can't find out what was first, the chicken or the egg, but OMB got into this blooming 2000 election, and CBO has a Republican--not any Alice Rivlin or Bob Reischauer, but they have a Republican fix--Mr. Crippen over at CBO. I have been working on this budget since we passed it back in 1973. 
   Both CBO and OMB started finding money. How we could as a party put in tax cuts and have the real issue for the election 2000. 
   This is very interesting. You don't find the word ``unified, unified, unified.'' That is all I have heard for the last 20 years--unified. It is not a unified budget. It is an outright budget surplus. That is what the CBO called it. It is not a budget surplus at all. The fact is, and I will quote the figures, the debt goes up each year for the next 5 years.

   Up, up, and away. Deficits, not surpluses; deficits--the Congressional Budget Office says--as far as the eye can see. 
   The Republicans were going to take the $1.9 trillion of Social Security. We have to not get into Social Security. We have to find $1 trillion for the tax cut about which we have been talking. So they said we have another $1 trillion. How do we do it? They said--at least the Republicans, and I will limit my comment to that because that is what they have in this particular amendment--they said: Let's not just have current policy. Let's stick to the spending caps that we put in. 
   They violate the spending caps. They violated it again last year, $21 billion, and we already are up to $17 billion and it is going to be at least $35 billion or $40 billion or more at the end of this year--already in violation of the caps. When the majority says they keep the caps on with no emergency spending and the economy stays at a growth of around 2 to 2.5 percent. The chairman of the Budget Committee on Sunday said CBO estimated two recessions--That is not right and I would like to correct that. CBO in this book does not project any recession during the next 10 years, rather 2.5-percent growth. 
   If you can get all of that growth you can get and have unemployment staying the same way, inflation staying way down, interest rates down, you obey the caps and you have no emergencies whatever. And then you find some money. 
   However, I point out that they knew where most of the money, 80 percent, was coming from--the other trust funds.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. We had a wonderful debate in the 1930s between Walter Lippmann and John Dewey. It was Mr. Lippmann's contention that the way to maintain and strengthen a democracy was get the best of minds in the various disciplines--foreign policy, economic policy, housing, whatever--get them around the table, determine the public's needs, the Nation's needs, determine a policy to answer those needs, and give it to the politicians in Congress and let them enact it. 
   John Dewey, the educator, said no. He said give the American people the truth. Let the free press give the American people the truth, and the truth will be reflected through the Congressmen and the Senators in the Congress  and we will have a strong democracy. And that is what we did for 200-and-some years. As Jefferson said, ``When the press is free and every man can read, all is safe.'' 
   What has happened? We are not safe any longer because the press has gotten into entertainment and they have joined the conspiracy and they call spending increases spending cuts and they call deficits surpluses. That is our dilemma. That is our dilemma. The only thing that is going to save us is that free press getting back to their professional code of conduct, and cut out the entertainment, and get back to telling the American people the truth. Then we would not have to argue about tax cuts. It has to be an embarrassment to come out here with a tax cut. It would be an embarrassment to come out here and just spend billions and billions of dollars that we do not have. This year we are spending $103 billion more than we are taking in. We are in a deficit position. 
   I thank the Chairman and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I certainly appreciate it. I really appreciate the significance of and the emphasis the distinguished Senator from Illinois and the distinguished Senator from California are exchanging on the floor about the realities of the budget. 
   Mr. President, some years ago, there was this debate between Walter Lippmann and the famous educator, John Dewey, with relation to how to build a strong democracy. Mr. Lippmann contended the way to have and maintain a strong democracy was to get the best of minds in the various disciplines countrywide--whether in education, housing, foreign relations, financial and fiscal policy, or otherwise--and let them meet around the table and determine the needs of the Nation and the policy thereof; take care of those needs, give it to the politicians, give it to the Congress, and let them enact it. It was John Dewey's contention--no, he said, what we need is the free press to tell the American people the truth. These truths would be reflected through their Representatives on the floor of the national Congress, and the democracy would continue strong. 
   For 200-some years now, we have had that free press reporting those truths. But, unfortunately, until this morning--until this morning, Mr. President--they have been coconspirators, so to speak, in that they have joined in calling spending increases spending cuts, and calling deficits surpluses. Eureka. I picked up the Washington Post this morning, and on the front page, the right-hand headline, they talk about the shenanigans of emergency spending and calling up the CBO with different economic assumptions--finding $10 billion. Just go to the phone if you are Chairman of the Budget Committee, call up Mr. Crippen over at CBO and say: Wait a minute. Those economic assumptions we used in the budget resolution--I have different ones. Therefore, give me $10 billion more. It is similar to calling up a rich uncle. 
   That is now being exposed in the Wall Street Journal. Of all things, they are talking in the front middle section about national and international news headlines and talking about double accounting and how they give them credit for saving the money and spending it at the same time. There is a whole column by our friend David Rogers on page 24. So, eureka, I found it. We are now breaking through and beginning to speak the truth. 
   I know the distinguished Chair is very much interested in actual and accurate accounting, and the actual fact is we are running a deficit, the Congressional Budget Office says, of $103 billion this year, which ends with August and September--just 2 more months after this July, and we will have spent $103 billion more than we take in; namely, on the deficit. 
   So, Mr. President, when you hear all of this jargon and plans about surpluses and how they find them and  whatever else, you go to the books and you turn to their reports and you say: Wait a minute now. The President came out in his document here, the CBO report--and I hold in my hand the midsession review, which came out 10 days ago and I said: Wait a minute. Let me find out where they find this surplus.

   Then I turn over to page 43. This is the President's projection. You can see over the 15 years--not 5 years.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you see the debt held by government accounts, end of period, $7.543 trillion, plus up there at the end of the period, the little 44, making an increase of debt to $7.587 trillion. There is the debt going up from $5.6 trillion to $7.6 trillion, an increase of $2 trillion in the debt. 
   Everybody is talking ``surplus.'' I wonder where in the world do they get the surplus. We are beginning to see it in the double accounting in the Wall Street Journal and otherwise. 
   Let's go to the Congressional Budget Office because my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, talked about a $2.9 trillion surplus. He is right. In the rhetoric at the very beginning, they talk about a surplus here on page 2--cumulative onbudget surpluses of projected and total, nearly $1 trillion between 1999 and 2009. During that same period, cumulative off-budget surpluses will total slightly more than $2 trillion. That is where he finds, I take it, the $2.9 trillion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have given the American people, as John Dewey said, ``the truth,'' because you look from 2000 right on through where they talk about the gross Federal debt, and the gross Federal debt starts up from the year 2000 and increases to the year 2004 from $5.664 trillion to $6.029 trillion. It is the same for 2004 and 2005. 
   Yes. I will agree that the Congressional Budget Office shows a diminution, a reduction, in the deficit from the year 2005 to 2009 over the 4-year period. There is a saving or reduction in 2006 of $38 billion; a reduction in the year 2007 of $57 billion; a reduction in the year 2008 of $75 billion; and a reduction in the year 2009 of $100 billion. So it is a cumulative reduction of $270 billion. 
   They talk about a $2.9 trillion surplus? At best they could talk, under the Congressional Budget Office, about $270 billion. 
   The reason they even can find the $270 billion is the most favorable of circumstances. The most favorable of circumstances is, one, current policy, as they say on one of the pages here. It says that it assumes discretionary spending will equal the statutory caps on such spending through 2002, and will grow at the rate of inflation thereafter. 
   That is the most favorable circumstance--no increases; just cap the spending, and adjust inflation thereafter for the first 5 years and inflation thereafter for the next 5 years. It assumes no emergency spending. 
   We have already seen that they are calling, as the distinguished Senator from Illinois was pointing out, the census an emergency. They have veterans' benefits as an emergency and they have everything else as an emergency. It assumes also that there is no tax cut and that the interest rate stays the same. You have all of these favorable assumptions, and at best, under the Congressional Budget Office, a saving of $270 billion rather than $2.9 trillion. 
   I have been trying my best to get a time to get on this floor. I thank everybody for the simple reason that the best of circumstances here are that, yes, inflation is low; interest rates are down; unemployment is down; employment figures are up. We have the best of circumstances, to President Clinton's credit. Yes, the deficits have been coming down. 
   Having said that, as Alan Greenspan said earlier in the year, let's stay the course. Let's stay the course and make sure we continue this, if there is ever a time to pay down the bill--I am glad the Senator from Illinois touched on this--the interest costs. 
   I was a member of the Grace Commission against waste, fraud, and abuse. We created during the 1980s the biggest waste in the world by voting a 25-percent across-the-board tax cut. Here we are about to repeat the crime. That is a crime against common sense. It is a crime against future generations. There isn't any question about it. 
   But everybody is talking about a tax cut. Republicans are talking one tax cut. The Democrats are talking, the White House is talking, and everybody is talking tax cut when in reality we don't have any taxes to cut. We don't have any revenues to lose. Everybody knows that. We created the biggest waste in that year. The interest costs are practically $1 billion a day on the national debt.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I will comment, too, on what the Senator from Illinois discussed about the lockbox and why we can't talk. We couldn't talk about lockbox, and we couldn't get cloture for the simple reason they would not allow my amendments. I gave them notice. I sent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to all Senators. I said, No. 1, I will put in a true lockbox. It was worked out with the Social Security Administration. Ken Apfel, who used to work with me when I was chairman of the Budget Committee, is now the Social Security Administrator. The only way to get a true lockbox is to not double the counting and say, I saved it, but then spend it. On the contrary, actually require the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit those amounts each month, place the Treasury bills you have to issue for the debt of Social Security back into the Social Security trust fund. 
   Somebody says: Wait; what are you going to do with that money? Do exactly what all pension reserves and insurance companies do: Keep it there--what we did for 35 years, from 1935 to 1968, until this changed in 1969. I was going to put a cap on the debt. They think it is a surplus. Say whatever the debt is as of September 30th, in 2 months' time, cap it off. Say that can't be exceeded. Put that limit there and find out who is telling the truth. 
   They are talking surpluses. I am saying it is deficits. It is debt increases. 
   Also, cut out the monkeyshine. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico and I had challenged the late Senator Chiles when he was chairman of the Budget Committee and he started using different economic assumptions. We lost on appeal of the ruling of the Chair, but we came around with 301(g) and wrote in the Budget Act that you couldn't have the new economic assumptions different from those in each particular budget resolution. These are the things we wanted to put in with respect to getting truth in budgeting when we passed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings back in 1985. 
   We have gone totally astray--the White House, Republican and Democrat, the news media--until this morning. That is my point. 
   I thank the Wall Street Journal, I thank the Washington Post for finally reporting some of the truths out here. If we can't level with the American people, no wonder they are talking about ``what kind'' of tax cut. They all want to pay down the debt. When they use the expression, ``pay down the debt'' or the ``public debt,'' it doesn't pay any debt at all. 
   Those T bills come due during the next 10 years and are not renewed. In the meantime, while they are not being renewed, the debt is transferred over to Social Security and other trust funds, so we owe Social Security this very minute $857 billion; by the year 2009, we will owe Social Security $2.7 trillion. Then they talk not only of surpluses but saving Social Security, how we have extended the life of Social Security, when we have actually bankrupted the blooming program. 
   Mr. President, $2.7 trillion by 2009; we get to 2013, when they really need the money, and it will be over $3 trillion. What Congress will find $3 trillion to start paying the benefits? This is serious business. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator and will limit my time so the Senator from Wyoming can take the floor. 
   The answer is, no, the phone is not ringing off the hook. I had this in the campaign for reelection last year. I put in a value-added tax in order to retire the deficit and the debt. Of course, I was called ``High Tax Hollings.'' I said, rather than tax cuts, we ought to get rid of the national debt and the waste of interest costs of $1 billion a day. I was reelected. 
   We have the most Republican of all States. South Carolina is the most conservative of all States. 
   Somehow the truth is coming around to the American people, or at least to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal as of this morning. I thank them for that.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished leader will yield, the truth is, on the contrary, we were given notice. We were told this particular violent crime trust authorization was just a place setter, a gatekeeper, so to speak, in the first degree, and we were going to voice vote it. 
   We were given notice that it was going to be voice voted and not use this particular maneuver to have a time agreement and, thereby, not be able to debate the rule change. So we were given notice in the other direction. We were totally misled. We were totally misled. I resent it. 
   Let me go back--there is no use in getting all excited. I am going back to Mississippi with the Governor, Ross Barnett. He was the first fellow to take the door off the capitol on Wednesday afternoon, and he lined them all up. Any and every citizen could come in and express his grief. And one day the trustee who cleaned up the capitol stood in line, and he said: I have to go to a funeral; my aunt just died. 
   And Governor Barnett said: When is that? 
   He said: Saturday. 
   I am hastening it along. 
   He said: All right. You can go Saturday; be back here on Monday. 
   And the trustee, Phillips, said: Yes, that is the truth. 
   I will be back. 
   And so 2 months had passed. Phillips hadn't come back, and the press all agreed, let's just jump on Ross and get him this time. And so they said: Governor, wait a minute; where is the trustee and everything else? And old Ross just laid back and said: If you can't trust the trustee, who can you trust? 
   If I can't trust the chairman and the chairman can't trust the ranking member, then who can I trust? We were given notice wrongly.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have all heard the expression stand and be counted for democracy. 
   Come on, give me a break. No one really thinks a Senator obviously elected to office is against democracy. No one in his right mind could think that the Department of State is against democracy and is incapable. 
   What we have is a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates at this particular moment we are spending over $100 billion more than we are  taking in this year. I didn't know this was coming up, but since I get questioned about there being no surplus for the year 1999, the Congressional Budget Office, as of June 30, estimated that we will spend this fiscal year, which ends at the end of September, $103 billion more than we take in. 
   The President's own document, the OMB projection, not only states we will have a deficit for the next 5 years, but the deficit and the debt will continue for a 15-year period, the debt going up from $5.6 trillion to $7.7 trillion. It is going up to 2.1 trillion bucks and everyone is running around talking about surplus, and we are getting 602(b) allocations at the Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce, of $1.3 billion less than we have this year. We are spending more than we are taking in, and otherwise trying to find $1.7 billion in the census. 
   Faced with those constrictions, I wonder where in the world do you find money for the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, 
   the Democratic Party and Republican Party--how do you justify it? 
   Back in the eighties we had Lech Walesa and they did have a wonderful labor movement and they did bring democracy there in Poland. But I don't know of the labor movement that is going on in the People's Republic of China. I have been there three times now and I have yet to meet a labor leader, much less the likes or ilk of Lech Walesa. 
   So, yes, we stand up to be counted for democracy. We are hoping to sustain the economic credibility of this particular republic by saying we have to make choices. I tried to pay for these programs. I have even introduced a value-added tax allocated to reducing the deficit and the debt and taking care of Social Security. But these friends who come to the floor and talk in fanciful terms about they are for democracy and independent movements for democracy--the inference being, of course, the State Department is not--on the contrary. 
   I hear about taking it from the Capital Investment Fund. I remember working some 4 years ago with Under Secretary Moose, Dick Moose, who used to be the director of our Foreign Relations Committee who the distinguished Senator from Indiana would remember well. Everybody is talking about security of the Embassies and facilities in the Department of State. The communications computerization of the Department of State and the Embassies overseas and around the world is in terrible shape. It is similar to the Pony Express. So 4 years ago we instituted the Capital Investment Fund to get Y2K compliance. The Chamber of Commerce, that crowd that was running all over the floor fixing the votes for Y2K--a problem that could not possibly happen for 6 months and everybody is beginning to comply and they wanted to upset 200 years of tort law back at the State level where they know how to administer it best--they came in to do that. And now they want to make darn sure the Department of State is not Y2K compliant. 
   Tell the Chamber of Commerce to look for democracy somewhere else and money somewhere else. The same for all these other entities that want to get NED, the National Endowment for Democracy. It is a political sop. It has been that for several years and everybody knows it. 
   We would like to give it all to desirable things. There have been some good things that happened under the National Endowment for Democracy years back, but they continue to embellish and run around with responsibilities they try to find, makeshift and otherwise, so they know it is going to be in trouble when they come to the floor. They get distinguished leadership to bring these amendments. I take it I will be in a minority, but I have gotten used to being a minority of the minority. 
   With that said, I hope we can save this amount of money somehow, the $30 million. It is not easy to get the moneys we need all over for the Department of State. I can tell you now, we are on course. To take $30 million from the telecommunications upgrades and computerization upgrades we are now about doing, and start cutting that back for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, is out of the whole cloth for this Senator who stands here in the well for democracy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the distinguished Senator and realize he is far more steeped in this particular discipline of accounting, of certified public accounting, than I am.  
   Yet having worked in the field and heard for the first time here in the last half hour of this particular amendment, it goes right to the heart of what has been going on. Specifically, we want to change an accounting system that has been on the books, agreed to, conformed with, never objected to, during the entire 4-year deliberation of the rewrite of the Telecommunications Act. I never heard anything about this need for a different system of accounting. Now, having adopted it, I am asking immediately: Wait a minute, what is going on here? We never heard of this or anything else like it. Then the giveaway is when my distinguished colleague says the United States Telephone Association, and so forth, little, little, little--little my eye. This is the Bell crowd. 
   I find out by telephone call they have had a recent audit and the auditors found billions of dollars of unaccounted-for equipment. They just had it on the books. They put it into the rate structure. And then they redeem those amounts into the rate-paying system. This, of course, affects the rates, it affects the amounts that go back to universal service, and everything else of that kind. So all of a sudden we really, rather than helping the little ones, are going to harm the little folks on a so-called accounting system change. 
   If anybody is intimately familiar with the rural telephone companies and the co-ops and everything else, this particular Senator is. The finest rural system there is is in the State of South Carolina. In fact, they have put in the Internet connections and everything else at all the public schools and what have you. Really, it is one of the finest rural groups. They never saw me about this or anything of this kind. This amendment definitely ought to be tabled. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Montana, the chairman of our Subcommittee on Communications, ought to be asking for a hearing on this one. Another phrase caught my attention, when they say ``historic cost.'' They could go all the way back to 1934, which they have already been rewarded for over the many years, 60 or 70 years. Otherwise that is exactly what they have earned as a monopoly. Yes, we are moving. Don't say they did not foresee it. 
   I have just been through a vigorous campaign and visited rural folks. I admire the new equipment they have. They are changing over. They know what it is. They know what competition is. The small ones, more or less, have been bringing about the competition. 
   It is the Bell companies that told this Senator and the committee time and again at hearings: We want to compete; we want to compete; we want to compete. 
   Please, my gracious, all they have done is combine. Southwest Bell has taken over Pacific Telesis. Now they want to take over Ameritech. Bell Atlantic has taken over NYNEX. Another one, we heard just the other day, is taking over U.S. West. They are all moving to combine and form more monopolies, and before long we will have Ma Bell all over again. 
   Then they have the audacity and unmitigated gall to come to the floor of the Senate and say let's just change the little accounting system so we can take care of all of these costs, when they have been caught short of unaccounted equipment that has been carried on the books over many years and they have long since been compensated for in their rates. 
   I can say the universal service to the small business in Wyoming and Montana when the Bell company puts this one over on the United Telephone Association--if they put this over, they are going to have to pay through the nose, I can tell you that right now. It is all going in. It is the big gobbling up the little ones. 
   There ought not to be any misunderstanding to all of a sudden changing their accounting systems because they have found unaccounted equipment on the books that have been kept over many years, for which they have long since been compensated, and for which they continue to charge over and over. That is what is at issue here; without a hearing and putting it on the commerce bill which has jurisdiction over the FCC and saying it is just a small thing, they just want to look out for people and want the same kind of report. 
   They want to get rid of the report that says you can carry all these expenses ad infinitum, back to 1934, and continue to charge the ratepayers for it. If that occurs, then universal service, the rates, and everything else with respect to the agreed-upon long distance and local rates is going totally out of kilter. The little boys are really going to suffer. 
   I am prepared, when all time has expired, to make a motion to table this amendment. It definitely ought to be tabled in behalf of all communications and, more particularly, on account of procedures in the Senate. We have a committee. The distinguished Senator is chairman of the subcommittee. The subject has never been mentioned, and, Heaven knows, I hear every day I am in the Senate: Please, call the Commission. We don't. Please write a letter to the Commission. All the downtown lawyers again and again want to try their cases politically when they cannot prevail administratively. 
   I know if it were a real problem, I would have long since heard about it. My rural people would have told me about it long ago. But bam, at 7 o'clock at night, they want to change the entire accounting system. It is the wrong procedure, if nothing else. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I will use just a minute or two, Mr. President. 
   The word ``competitive'' intrigued this particular Senator. As they congratulate each other over there with respect to this particular attempted fix, let me remind the Senate that we are talking about monopolies. Monopolies do not have general accounting principles because they are not in the field of competition. They are monopolies. They are guaranteed a return. And extra accounting principles have been long since established for these companies and for small ones in that the independent, local exchange carriers--there are many small ones--they are monopolies, too. So these accounting methods and principles have been in force for a long time. 
   And here without a hearing, and just, bam, and to start talking about small--and there is a $30 million tax, and so forth, that is just spurious reasoning and fanciful notions, if I have ever heard them. 
   The opposite is true. We are trying, with respect to a monopoly, to make sure that it does not go to the ratepayer because the monopoly is guaranteed a return. So if any true costs are there, they are going to have to be reflected in their guaranteed rate of return. 
   So this amendment is totally out of order in the sense of procedures here in the Senate where we have a committee and we can have hearings on it and we can find out if there is any infringement with respect to the concern of the Senator from Wyoming. Because he knows all about accounting. 
   But I can tell you now, general accounting principles do not apply to monopolies--and should not apply to monopolies--because there is no competition. They are guaranteed that return, and that is why they have the special accounting system. 
   I thank the Chair. At the end of this, if my distinguished chairman would permit, I think we ought to move to table this one.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes. I think whatever accounting system they have, I do not find a difference in it. I would go with having a hearing and give you a definite return. We are not trying to delay or anything like that, but I would have a hearing before the subcommittee of the Senator from Montana, and the full committee, and we would be glad to report something out. But we never have had hearings, and you just say ``little and small.''  
   The United States Telephone Association, that is big. I know from hard experience that is big. That is a ``Big Bell" company. In relation to the chairman of this so-called company that has the accounting system, and so forth, do you know what they reported in USA Today the other day? The chairman of Bell South made last year $55.9 million--either $56 or $57 million. Can you imagine the head of a monopoly guaranteed a return, with 
   no competition, making $55 million? Come on. And you are talking about little things? Don't give me that. They are not little. In just agreeing to little and big, we have a different idea basically of what is big and what is little in this particular debate.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I don't know of a reason for a separate accounting system. If there is less of an accounting system for the smaller one, I tend in that direction. 
   I agree with the sentiment that you have to look out for the small so they are not gobbled up by the big. So I would almost agree to less of an accounting system for the small rather than the same required for the big. I am trying to go in your direction.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a colloquy with the senior Senator from  Wisconsin, Senator KOHL, regarding the $1 million appropriation for the Western Wisconsin Methamphetamine Law Enforcement Initiative in S. 1217. 
   As the Senator from Wisconsin knows, the domestic manufacture and importation of Methamphetamine, also know as Meth, has become a continuing public health threat to the United States and most recently to the Midwest. Senate KOHL, what is the extent of the Meth problem within the State of Wisconsin? Also, would you please describe how the proposed $1 million will be used to address the problem?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my subcommittee chairman and colleague, Senator GREGG, in presenting to the Senate S. 1217, the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies appropriations bill. Once again, I would like to commend Chairman GREGG for his outstanding efforts and bipartisan approach in bringing a bill to the floor that--in most areas--is good and balanced. 
   We fund a wide variety of Federal programs through this appropriations bill. We fund the FBI, the DEA, the State Department and our embassies overseas, the Census Bureau, NOAA, the Supreme Court, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the list goes on and on. As a result, this bill provides funding for a host of efforts that range from fighting ``the war on drugs'' and ``the battle against cybercrimes'', to preparing at the local level against ``domestic terrorism'' and ``natural disasters.'' This bill provides funding to protect both our elderly citizens from abuse and marketing scams and our youth from sexual predators on the streets and on the Internet. We provide funding for fisheries research and atmospheric research; we provide funding for our weather satellite systems and forecasts; we provide funding for the management of our fragile coastal areas--initiatives that impact every single aspect of our community--businesses, farms, the fishing industry, the tourism industry, and the consumer. 
   In total, this bill provides $34.1 billion in budget authority which is about $400 million above last year's appropriated level. Even though we had an increase of $400 million in our allocation for fiscal year 2000, the funding level requested for the Census Bureau for fiscal year 2000 was a $1.7 billion increase above the current funding level. In other words, Mr. President, to fully fund the 2000 decennial census we were required to cut $1.3 billion in funding from the fiscal year 1999 funding level for all other programs. This was not an easy task, and with the exception of a few circumstances that I will touch on in greater detail later, Senator GREGG did a remarkable job. 
   Chairman GREGG has mentioned many of the funding specifics in this bill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point out to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill. 
   This bill provides $17 billion for the Department of Justice, including $2.9 billion for the FBI, $1.2 billion for the DEA, and $3 billion for the Office of Justice programs. Within the Department of Justice, we continue the Safe Schools Initiative which Senator GREGG and I started last year, and provides $218 million in funding for additional school resource officers, technology, and community initiatives in an effort to combat violence in our schoools. 
   Mr. President, again this year Americans watched news stories unfold about shootings and other violent acts as they occurred in our schools. Violent crime in our schools is simply unacceptable and must be stopped. We cannot allow violence or the threat of violence to turn our schools into a hostile setting that prevents our students from obtaining the education they deserve. To fully understand the circumstances under which our youth are attending school, one needs to only look at a few statistics that have been gathered recently: 
   During the 1996-97 school year, 10 percent of all public schools reported one or more serious violent crimes to the police or other law enforcement representatives. An additional 47 percent of public schools reported at least one less serious or nonviolent crime to police. (1998 Department of Education Annual Report on School Safety) 
   About 6,093 students were expelled during the 1996-1997 academic school year for bringing firearms or explosives to school. (1998 Report on State Implementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act--School Year: 1996-1997, Department of Education) 
   In 1995, over 2 million students between the ages 12 and 19 feared they were going to be attacked or harmed at school. 
   Likewise, about 2.1 million students between the ages 12 an d19 avoided one or more places at school for fear of their own safety. (1998 Indicators of School Crime and Safety, U.S. Depts. of Education and Justice.) 
   This Safe Schools initiative is aimed at protecting our children by putting more police in the school setting. The bill provides $180 million, $55 million above the President's request, through the Office of Justice programs solely for the hiring of school resource officers. The additional $38 million is directed towards community planning and prevention activities--for local police departments and sheriff's offices to work with schools and other community-based organizations to develop programs to improve the safety of elementary and secondary school children and educators in and around the schools of our nation. This is a much needed program, and an initiative that has proven to be successful in the past. 
   This bill also provides $283.7 million for the Violence Against Women Program, $75 million for State prison grants, $400 million for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, $40 million for drug courts, and $284.5 million for juvenile justice programs. In addition, $25 million has again been provided for the bulletproof vest grant program to reduce the risk of serious injury or death to our nation's law enforcement officers. In an effort to respond to the proliferation of crimes involving children, the committee has provided $19.9 million for the Missing Children Program, an increase of $2.78 million over last year's amount. This money will be used to combat the ever increasing number of crimes against children with an emphasis on kidnapping and sexual exploitation. 
   The bill provides $7.2 billion for the Commerce Department, of which $3.1 billion is to be used to conduct the decennial census. The administration submitted a budget amendment for an additional $1.7 billion in funding for the decennial census; unfortunately, we received that request only two days before consideration of the bill by the subcommittee and full committee. Senator GREGG and I are working on scheduling a hearing prior to conference with the House to address the budget amendment, and I appreciate the chairman's efforts in addressing this issue in a nonpartisan manner. 
   The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is funded at $233.1 million which is above last year's level by $29.6 million, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program is funded at a level of $109.8 million. This amount will fully fund all MEP centers. 
   The bill also provides $2.5 billion for NOAA, an increase of $384 million over last year's funding level. I am pleased that the distinguished chairman has worked with me to insure that we maintain a focus on our oceans and coastal waterways. 
   Regarding NOAA, Mr. President, if I could just take a minute, I would like to recognize the outstanding work of Dr. Nancy Foster, head of the National Ocean Service, which oversees the labs, estuarine reserves, and the Coastal Services Center in my home state of South Carolina. I can tell you she is one of the hardest working public servants with whom I have had the privilege of working over the past several  years, and she has brought to the job boundless energy, understanding, and an ability to fix problems. 
   Dr. Foster has been with NOAA since 1977. She helped create the National Marine Sanctuary and Estuarine Research Reserve Programs. These programs preserve America's near shore and offshore marine environments in the same manner as do the better known national parks and wildlife refuges run by the Department of the Interior. Nancy went on to serve as the Director of Protected Resources at NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, where she managed the Government's programs to protect and conserve whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other endangered and protected species. After that, she was named the Deputy Director of the entire fisheries service, where she proved especially sensitive to the economic impact on communities and the need to promote what the folks downtown and in academia call ``sustainable development.'' 
   In 1997, Secretary Bill Daley and Under Secretary Jim Baker tapped Nancy to take over the National Ocean Service. That is about as high as a career professional can go; in other agencies or bureaus, this level of position would be held by at least an Assistant Secretary-level official. NOS is the oldest part of NOAA--coastal mapping traces its lineage back to 1807--and she directed reinvention and change so that the Ocean Service became one of the most modern and more effective parts of NOAA. Dr. Foster is always finding new ways to do business. She is an innovator. She directed the total modernization of NOAA's nautical mapping and charting. Along with Dr. Sylvia Earle, she has created a partnership with the National Geographic Society to launch a 5-year undersea exploratory program called ``Sustainable Seas Expeditions.'' Their goal is to use these exploratory dives to rekindle our nation's interest in the oceans, and especially the national marine sanctuaries. They are bringing back the kind of enthusiasm and public education that Jacques Cousteau created when I first came to the Senate. 
   Mr. President, Nancy Foster is the person at NOAA whom the rank and file employees--the marine biologists, scientists and researchers--trust and look up to. She is a role model for professional women everywhere, especially those who work in the sciences. She is an official whom we in the Congress can look to for leadership and who pays attention to local and constituent issues. She is non-partisan and plays it straight. 
   Dr. Foster recently underwent surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and is home recuperating. So Nancy, if you are watching at home on C-Span, on behalf of Senator GREGG, the Appropriations Committees as well as the Commerce Authorization Committee, and our professional staff, I want to wish you the best. Take your time and get well. We need you back on the job, and wish you a speedy recovery. 
   The bill includes a total of $5.4 billion for the Department of State and related agencies. Within the State Department account, $883 million has been provided for worldwide security, an increase of $146 million above the President's request. Additionally, in recognition of the high profile risk that State Department family members face in overseas locations, $40 million has been included to improve the security in and around both housing and school areas for the families of those who serve in this capacity. The funding level also includes payment of international organization and peacekeeping funds, including $244 million for UN arrears. 
   I highlighted a few minutes ago the Safe Schools Initiative that Chairman GREGG and I have worked together on for the past 2 years. I would also like to comment briefly on two other important initiatives before closing: electronic commerce and COPS. 
   Regarding electronic commerce and the Internet, I would like to discuss an area which is growing in significance each day. With the explosion of the Internet as an electronic transaction medium, we cannot ignore the increasing potential for fraud, abuse, and attacks on consumer privacy. If we stop and take a look at the Internet and the potential that it has, we recognize that its very design allows schemers and con artists to reach more people, with more scams, at a faster rate while remaining virtually anonymous. This is a veritable breeding ground for electronic fraud and abuse. In fact, it was recently reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) receives more than 100 complaints per day about illegal Internet activity involving fraudulent stock and investment schemes. In 1998, the National Consumers League received over 7,700 Internet fraud complaints which was a 385-percent increase over the previous year. With reports like this I think that it is clear that protection efforts need to keep pace with the growing number of Internet users, particularly since estimates indicate that perhaps 50 percent of the population of the United States will have access to the Internet by the year 2000. 
   In response to the growth of this sector, Mr. President, this bill includes funding for a number of programs and activities. I would like to again commend Chairman GREGG for his efforts to address this growing problem of Internet fraud, particularly given the tight budget constraints under which this bill was put together. This bill provides $133 million in funding to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for FY 2000, an increase of $16.7 million above the current funding level. This increase was provided in part because the subcommittee is mindful of the FTC's efforts toward ensuring that electronic commerce continues to flourish and consumers do not become victims of fraud and abuse while conducting transactions on the web. Additionally, the committee has provided $10 million in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to assist in the prevention, detection, and prosecution of Internet related fraud and investment schemes. 
   Finally, regarding the COPS initiative, I can fully understand the difficult decisions the chairman had to make as we put this bill together. And as I have stated, I support him on just about everything in this bill--with the exception of eliminating the COPS program. This is a good program that has proven to work. And it works well. Crime has been declining for 6 1/2 consecutive years and is at a 25 year low. We are getting the jump on crime and this is not the time to just stop funding the program. Numerous law enforcement groups agree. The International Brotherhood of Police Officers support the program, the National Sheriffs Association supports the program, the National Troopers Coalition supports the program, the International Association of Chiefs of Police supports the program, and the list goes on. I completely understand the limitations under which the chairman operated in getting a bill to the floor. Several of my colleagues have been working for the past several weeks in putting together an amendment to reestablish the COPS Program. While I believe that program deserves even more funding than provided in the amendment, I also believe the amendment is a good response and practical effort toward restoring an effective and valuable program while acknowledging the many funding restraints imposed on this bill. I look forward to debating this issue further when the amendment is offered. 
   In closing let me say again that given the allocation we received, this is a good bill. Many--but not all--of the administration's priorities were addressed to some extent. Likewise many--but not all--of the priorities of congressional Members were addressed to some extent. I know that every year we face difficulties with respect to limited funding and multiple priorities, but the funding caps this year proved to be unusually prohibitive. As a result, tough decisions were made. However, I believe that the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee made those decisions in a bipartisan and judicious manner which will allow us to address many critical funding needs such as Census 2000, 1000 additional Border Patrol agents, counter-terrorism efforts, the FBI's capabilities to combat cybercrime and crimes against children, DEA's continued war on drugs, critical fisheries research, and overseas peacekeeping efforts. 
   I would like to take a moment before closing to acknowledge and thank Senator GREGG's staff and my staff for their hard work and diligence in bringing together a bill that does everything I have just mentioned and more. They have worked nonstop in a straightforward and bipartisan manner, to deliver the bill that is before the Senate  today. This bill could not have come together without their efforts and I thank them for all of their hard work. 
   Mr. President, let me reiterate my gratitude to Chairman GREGG and my admiration for the balanced bill that he has produced. What we were confronted with, in a capsule, was a cut of some $1.3 billion from the present policy appropriation, with the ad-on demand of $1.7 billion for the census for next year. Within those confines, Senator GREGG has really done an outstanding job, I can tell you that. It is balanced. It is thoughtful. I have seen, over the years, this bill handled by several chairmen but no one has done the job Senator GREGG has done on this particular measure. So I am glad to join with him. We want to move it as expeditiously as we possibly can. 
   With that said, let me yield to the chairman.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you heard the objection. We asked for 12 amendments--just a dozen, not unlimited--and there was objection. 
   I have three amendments. One is a true lockbox. I made the motion back in 1990, as a member of the Budget Committee, for the lockbox. We reported it out 19 to 1. I then went on the other side of the aisle and got the late Senator John Heinz from Pennsylvania, and he and I joined together, and by 98 votes--when the present distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania said everybody, that was everybody then; all except 2--98 Senators voted for the lockbox, passed it, it passed the House, and it was signed on November 5, 1990, by President George Bush. 
   But they do not obey it; they do just as the Abraham amendment presently before the body. When you use that expression, ``paying down the debt,'' what they do is take the Social Security money and use it for any and every thing but Social Security. That is what is occurring. 
   We presently owe Social Security $857 billion. That is why I have three amendments. 
   The true lockbox is to keep a reserve, as we require under the 1994 Pension Reform Act for corporate America; I say we are going to do the same thing for Government America. 
   I have a second amendment with respect to actually getting a return since we are using Social Security money. We only get a 5-percent return on these special Treasury securities. Standard & Poor's shows from 1990 to 1998 the real return on private securities is 14 percent and the nominal return is 18 percent. 
   Since we passed this in 1926, over the 72-year period, including the Depression, we have a 10.9-percent return on average. 
   So I think if you are going to use our money, do not use it on the cheap, do not get a free ride. Pay in the 10.9 percent rather than the 5.6 percent, and we begin to rejuvenate Social Security rather than drain it. Otherwise, I want to cut out the monkeyshines of the chairman of the Budget Committee, calling over to the Congressional Budget Office and saying: Give me $10 billion more. How does he do it? He uses different economic assumptions. 
   Under the law, under section 301(g) of the Budget Act, they are required to use the same economic assumptions as contained in the budget resolution. But rather than maintaining those particular assumptions, they just make new assumptions. 
   We had nothing to do with it. I am on the Budget Committee. We were never called or notified or anything else of the kind. All of a sudden we find out there is $10 billion left for defense. There is another $3 billion for transportation, another $1 billion. Already we have busted the caps, just by a telephone call, $14 billion. 
   I have three amendments. I am ready to offer them, but they won't let us offer them. That is why I am not voting for cloture. Everybody ought to understand what is going on. They won't let it be treated as an unlimited measure, as we always have had discourse in the Senate in my almost 33 years, until this kind of control. We had to fight to get up the Patients' Bill of Rights. We had to hold up all the appropriations bills. Now we can't even get an objective discussion of Social Security because they know how to gear it. They have it geared where they are going to pay down the debt, always talking lockbox, lockbox, lockbox. 
   They are in violation right now of the 13301 lockbox, and they will continue to do so. It is all politics, election 2000. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this charade has gone far enough. The economy gives indications of overheating causing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, and now both the President and the Congress are in a foot race to cut taxes to make sure the economy catches fire. Rather than a surplus, the President's OMB Mid-Session Review on page 42 projects an increase in the debt each year for five years, and on page 43, by computation, an increase in the debt of $1.883.4 trillion over fifteen years. Some suggest cutting spending; others downsizing the government. The Democrats did both in 1993 and lost the Congress in 1994. Now, neither Republicans nor Democrats will vote to make substantial cuts and what's really needed is a tax increase. When Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget the national debt was less than $1 trillion and interest costs of $16 billion. Now, CBO projects a deficit this year of $5.6 trillion with interest costs of $356 billion. We have increased spending since President Johnson's time $340 billion each year for nothing. A fiscal cancer. To excise this fiscal cancer, to put government on a pay-as-you-go basis, spending cuts and a tax increase will be necessary. A value added tax of 5 percent dedicated to eliminating the debt and stabilizing Social Security is in order. It would promote a very much needed paradigm of saving. More than that, it would eliminate a substantial disadvantage in international trade. The deficit in the balance of trade nears $300 billion this year. Every industrial country except the United States has a VAT which is rebated at the port of departure. Articles produced in Europe enter the United States market with a 15 percent rebated advantage, and from Korea 25 percent. All this talk of surpluses and tax cuts misleads the American public. What we really should be doing in good times is paying down the National Debt. This bill that I am introducing today will do the trick.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to insure the safe transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat) via the United States Postal Service and its contract carriers. 
   The Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Improvement Act of 1990, P.L. 103-311, specifically exempted the U.S. Postal Service from Department of Transportation (DOT) hazmat enforcement. Although they are exempt from DOT hazmat enforcement, the U.S. Postal Service self-governs hazardous materials transportation through internal regulations and inspections. 
   The National Transportation Safety Board has made numerous recommendations over the years to subject the U.S. Postal Service to DOT inspections and increased enforcement efforts. In addition, they have also recommended that the Postal Service be subject to enforcement obligations similar to those observed by other package and express mail operations. Due to the fact that only a small percentage of mail is transported exclusively by the U.S. Postal Service and most of it is contracted out to other carriers, it makes sense that all mail and package transporters be subject to the same DOT regulations and inspections. 
   We all remember the horrifying crash of ValuJet Airlines, flight 592, into the Everglades in May of 1996. Although the cause of the ValuJet accident was not attributed to the U.S. Postal Service, the situation in which it occurred demonstrated the importance of accurate labeling in the transportation of hazardous materials. Following the ValuJet accident, the NTSB made multiple recommendations to the U.S. Postal Service about increased safety in the transport of hazmat. However, in the year following the ValuJet incident there were thirteen additional hazardous materials incidents that occurred when U.S. mail was transported via air. There should be a better safety net for the public and the employees who are charged with the safe transport of the packages, mail and express items. 
   Similarly, the frightening success of the Unabomber throughout the 1980's and 1990's underscores the need for tougher controls over hazardous materials sent via the U.S. Postal Service. Ted Kaczynski repeatedly sent explosive devices in packages through the mail system resulting in three deaths and 29 injuries. These packages, which weighed on average between five and ten pounds, were never inspected for hazardous contents. Largely in response to the Unabomber, the U.S. Postal Service implemented new requirements addressing package mail, however if a hazmat package is not identified at the source, it is important that the Department of Transportation hazmat inspectors have the authority to inspect packages carried by surface and air carriers. 
   These accidents clearly demonstrate that the shipment of undeclared hazardous materials is a serious problem that needs more attention. While the U.S. Postal Service has worked hard to train its employees to recognize hazmat shipments, much of the transportation of postal material is done via contract carriers who are not U.S. Postal Service employees. Efforts to address this issue have been hindered by the exclusion of DOT inspectors from regulating hazardous materials shipped via the U.S. Postal Service. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the U.S. Postal Service and the DOT hazmat inspectors are faced with an enormous task--keeping our mail and our transportation systems safe. My bill would provide for increased authority in hazmat inspections by authorizing DOT inspectors to work in tandem with U.S. Postal Inspectors. The safety of our transportation system is dependent on the safety of the cargo it is carrying--all hazmat packages should be adequately inspected and if found unsafe, they should be treated appropriately, expeditiously and equally.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize South Carolina's peach farmers for their hard work and their delicious peaches. 
   My staff has been delivering South Carolina peaches to offices throughout the Senate and the U.S. Capitol all day. Thanks to South Carolina peach farmers, those of us here in Washington will be able to cool off from the summer heat with delicious South Carolina peaches. 
   For a relatively small state, South Carolina is second in the nation in peach production. In fact, this year farmers across South Carolina planted more than 16,000 acres of peaches. As my colleagues can attest, these are some of the finest peaches produced anywhere in the United States. 
   As we savor the taste of these South Carolina peaches, we should remember the work and labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. While Americans enjoy peaches for appetizers, entrees, and desserts, most do not stop to consider where they come from. Farmers will be laboring all summer in the heat and humidity to bring us what we call the ``perfect candy.'' What else curbs a sweet tooth--is delicious, nutritious, and satisfying, but not fattening? The truth is, Mr. President, that our farmers are too often the forgotten workers in our country. Through their dedication and commitment, our nation is able to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other foods. In fact, our agricultural system, at times, is the envy of the world. 
   Mr. President, as Senators and their staff feast on these delicious peaches, I hope they will remember the people in South Carolina who made this endeavor possible: David Winkles and the entire South Carolina Farm Bureau; and the South Carolina Peach Council. They have all worked extremely hard to ensure that the Senate gets a taste of South Carolina. 
   I hope everyone in our Nation's Capitol will be smiling as they enjoy the pleasure of South Carolina peaches.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield sufficient time as may be necessary under the time I am allotted under the agreement. 
   Mr. President, a notable author once stated that ``decades surrounding a new millennium are periods of severe disruptions and cultural transformations.'' In the context of American politics, it appears that this prophecy is coming to fruition even before the 21st century officially arrives. 
   From the manner in which this legislation has been considered, and unfortunately, from its ultimate passage, it appears that this country is embarking upon a serious transformation of America's constitutionalism. 
   For 200 years, we have honored a system of federalism that recognized the appropriate balance between States  and the Federal Government concerning the administration of civil law. Civil disputes unrelated to constitutional claims were considered to be reserved to the states and local citizens. But this cherished notion of states' rights no longer seems to be the case. Now, upon the idea of promoting industrialism, and more specifically, the so-called growth of technology, it appears that federalism, as well as the constitutional rights of American citizens, are becoming not only dishonored, but for sale to the highest bidder. 
   There are some who will support this legislation today upon the grounds that this is a bill limited in scope. Nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation includes some of the broadest limitations ever imposed on consumers' civil remedies, including severe restrictions on the recovery of economic losses and the ability to pursue class action suits. 
   The majority's claims about the recovery of economic losses greatly exceed the degree to which economic losses will be recoverable under the bill. In reality, the legislation will forbid the recovery of economic losses in almost every situation. 
   The conference majority contends that the class action provision has been made more pro-plaintiff because of the change made to the monetary requirement--from $1 million to $10 million--and the change made to the class size requirement, which is now 100 members. However, the conference majority failed to highlight the decision by the conference committee to add a provision that allows any class action suit to be removed to federal court in the event the suit includes a claim for punitive damages. The addition of this provision has expanded the federalization of class actions suits well beyond the provision in the original bill. 
   The conference report states that my provision on consumer credit protection has been revised to reflect the true intent of the provision, which was to prevent consumers from losing their mortgages because of Y2K failures. However, the purpose of the provision was not to singularly protect mortgages, but to protect consumers against adverse actions in relation to all debt-related transactions, including automobile loans and credit card obligations. 
   I know that many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle will vote for final passage because of the President's decision to sign this bill. I am most disappointed in the President's decision. When the President announced and carried out his veto of the products liability bill three years ago, I applauded. He states then that there was no justification for broad restrictions on punitive damages, joint and several liability, and broad preemption of State law. He reiterated those concerns in several statements on this bill. Yet, he announces his intention to sign the bill. In fact, his staff says he'll sign the legislation, even though it doesn't reflect the actual agreement between the White House and conference members. 
   I assure my colleagues that if we remain on this course, the constitutional and moral soul of this Nation will soon perish. This ideology of short term gain, and success at all costs, will surely work to our detriment. Consideration of this bill reminds me of a quote by Horace Rumpole, when he said:  
   We went to all that trouble with King John to get trial by our peers, and now a lot of lawyers with the minds of business consultants want to abolish juries.  
   Mr. President, when I hear the expression by my distinguished chairman about a victory for the Nation and such nonsense from the distinguished Senator from Oregon about the consumers not getting the shaft--that is exactly what they are getting. That is exactly what is happening. 
   We tried our best to protect the consumers. You name the consumer organization in America--Public Citizen, Consumers Union--they are all still opposed to this conference report. 
   I stand here with a letter which the American Bar Association recently wrote:  
   The American Bar Association opposes enactment of H.R. 775 in either the form that passed the Senate on June 15, 1999 or the form that passed the House of Representatives on May 12, 1999.....The American Bar Association believes that the rights of the States should not be trampled in the rush to enact legislation to address concerns about Y2K. Traditionally, legal principles governing both tort and contract action have been the province of the States, not the Federal Government. The legal issues likely to be presented by the Year 2000 problem are not unique.

He is liable to be President. It reads, Governor Bush--``At a breakfast this morning Bush gets big support from Silicon Valley.'' He got all the executives out there. He just pledges all these things, I am telling you right now, way better than the distinguished chairman. And the distinguished chairman is pretty good.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. So the record is made with respect to money. Ordinarily, we have the rule--I want to be within the Senate rules of the dignity of the body. But we have to get to the reality. No one is asking for this except those in the money chase. And, yes, it is bipartisan. There isn't any question about that. 
   But this is a shabby performance. It is a sad day in the history of the Senate. Now what really occurred when we went into that conference is that the House receded to the Senate except for a minor amendment. We voted on it. Then they started negotiating on the fix, so as to ensure everybody was on board. They knew they were going to get a bill. The Senator from Connecticut then made the call to the President after midnight. I thought the only person who could get the President after midnight was Monica. 
   The White House sent five veto letters. Yet, the President plans to sign the bill, notwithstanding. 
   How emblematic of this administration. We fought like tigers to get this economy going with the 1993 budget. We cut spending. We raised taxes. We did away with 300,000 Federal employees. We got the economy going even though we could not get a single vote on the other side.  
   Then later, of course, the President joined the other side, went down and threw all of his friends in Congress overboard saying we taxed them too much. Then we had GATT. Then we had the NAFTA with Mexico, and he threw his labor friends overboard. Of course, that has been an abomination. 
   You cannot get to reality. They said it was going to increase trade. We went from a $5 billion-plus to a $20 billion-minus deficit. That was going to pay the Mexican worker better. He is taking home 20 percent less pay. It was going to solve the immigration problem. It is worse. It was going to solve the drug problem. They have a narcodemocracy down there. 
   But the President threw that crowd overboard. Now he throws overboard the consumers, middle America, after five veto messages on a much worse bill. 
   The Senator from Vermont is right on target. There isn't any question, when they put out this sheet here--even from my side--in the policy committee meeting there at lunch: How the conference report improves on the Senate-passed bill proportionate liability, even though they rejected Senator KERRY's proposal to place the burden on the defendant. They put the burden on the plaintiff. Individual consumers supposedly are carved out of proportionate liability, that is if they are not part of a class. 
   If by chance they are part of a class, their suit is automatically removable to federal court, in the event the claim seeks punitive damages. The President said he would never federalize class actions. They claim the bill preserves the authority of states to void contracts. But I can list a number of contracts that would be illegal under State law but would be enforceable under the conference-reported bill. So contracts which were entered into on a fraudulent or unconstitutional basis would still be enforced. 
   I will never forget the distinguished Senator from North Carolina; he tried to instruct the Senator from Oregon on economic damages. 
   I will give you the case. The client comes in. I am an old-time lawyer, and I represent clients. You have to tell them the truth. The poor client comes in and says: Hollings, I've got a $10,000 computer I bought last year, and now it's after January the first, and it has crashed. It is not Y2K compliant. They told me it was going to last for 10 years. I want you to bring my case. 
   I said: Wait a minute. They have to understand you have 90 days to wait around even though there is no duty to fix. The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, offered an amendment to require a free fix--that was in response to the Senator from Oregon's lament about fix the problem, fix the problem, just fix the problem. Well, that is exactly what were attempting to do. We said: Let's get rid of the lawyers. We will fix the problem. Yet, they would not accept that in the conference report. 
   So I say to the prospective client: In that 90 days nothing is going to happen. Then I have to investigate in great detail because on proportionate liability I do not want to find that the parquet from Hewlett-Packard was made in India and thus discover that I should have gone to New Delhi instead of Hartford to bring this case. I have to then file the pleadings. I have to thereupon get in with the interrogatories, attend all the discoveries because that is the billable-hour crowd. 
   You do not have money for billable hours obviously. This is middle America. That is how they get their day in court. So I will attend the interrogatories. I will conduct the trial, and I will handle the appeal. 
   By that time, you will owe me over $10,000. Now do you really want me to bring this case, considering you can't get any economic loss? I know you said you had to let two of your employees go because you could not pay them during all this time that it has been down. I know you have a loss of business. I know you have lost your reputation and everything else of that kind. But there is no economic loss. 
   The distinguished Senator from North Carolina is the best in the business. He will elaborate on that particular point. But that, more or less, gets rid of the lawyers. There never has been anything really for Y2K cases for attorneys. But to come in here now and say it does that, it is just shocking that we have just done away with middle America. The civil justice system has been permanently damaged. The very system that supports our Democratic society and consumers. That is why I stand here, 
   for the consumers of America, for middle America, for those who cannot employ a trial attorney. 
   I go right to that White House and why they changed, because the best story that came out was in the New York Times. I think it is dated just yesterday, June 30. It has this statement in here, that the Vice President, as he begins his campaign for the Presidency, was eager to rid himself of the ``taint'' of financial support from trial lawyers. 
   No. 1, try to get some money out of that trial lawyer crowd, hard money. It is limited to $1,000. Soft money, let's go to Silicon Valley. There is Bush. He is there this morning, the Governor. This is the soft money bill. That crowd, he has $36 million. He has more than GORE, the Vice President, the President, and Bill Bradley all put together. One fellow has it. He can get that money. They know where to get soft money. 
   I can't get much hard money out of that trial lawyer crowd. I want more from them, I want them to know. I have publicly stated that on the floor. But they don't have soft money. 
   But the ``taint'' is the one I take exception to, because I am proud to be associated with trial lawyers. They are in there, down in the pits, on the front lines protecting middle America. All I hear in this Congress is about middle America--taxes, taxes, taxes. How about rights, rights, rights? They don't have the money for billable hours. 
   A crowd such as we have up here in this Washington group, all the lobbyists, I am glad they put that list--is that the billable hour list the distinguished chairman just handed in for the record? 
   So with the billable hour list, sure, they are lazy. They don't try cases. They continue cases. They go to the golf course. The clock runs and they send the bills. But you have to produce if you are a trial lawyer or you don't get anything. You take on all the expenses. 
   This is a system that has worked for over 200 years at the State level. All the State authorities now are opposed to this Federal adulteration, but they are talking about how they are looking out for consumers and a victory for America and those kind of things. 
   I am particularly shocked at my Republican chairman who has led the fight on campaign finance reform. I worked with him. I have a bill in for a constitutional amendment to try to legalize, if you please, the 1974 act before it was made unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. In one line: The Congress of the United States is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. Once we do that, we go back to the 1974 act, do away with the soft money, everything on top of the table, and we are limited on the amount of money--we, candidate--we are limited on buying the office. But the money to buy the office is bad enough when the money goes so far as to buy the principle. That is a shocking thing to me. If there is such a thing as campaign finance reform, then in the name of campaign finance reform, kill this conference report, because this is an abortion. There isn't any question in my mind. It is way worse than we have ever had in any particular measure. 
   I want to say one word about the software industry, because I have worked in the Congress over the years with that particular industry, but they are learning a bad lesson now. They are learning they can buy anything, because they can change around State law, just them. 
   I have been up here, 32, now going on 33, years. We have never done this for any special group. Here they agree something could be fixed in 90 days. That is the provision in the bill. 
   We are giving them still--you have July, August, September, October, November, December, almost 6 months to still get it fixed, rather than 90 days. But they come in and demand this, when they now really are trying to demand everything. 
   Everybody ought to know that the Internet was started by the antigovernment crowd, free market, free market. After we developed the Internet in 1968, with Dopper, thereupon, there came, later on, in the middle of the 1980s, none other than the  best of the best, President Reagan. He gave a voluntary restraint agreement to the semiconductor industry because they were going broke. Intel had given up one of their particular display chips, if you remember. They were going out of business. They hung on, and we instituted Semi-Tech. When I went into the Intel plant in Dublin, Ireland, the manager there, Mr. Frank McCabe, said: Senator, we would have never had all of this if you hadn't put the $500 million in Semi-Tech. That is government. 
   They are all talking about pork, pork, pork. I want to emphasize the pork about which my distinguished colleague always talks. We gave them that particular pork, and now they have come to town and they want estate tax cuts. They want the capital gains tax cut. They want to do away with taxing the Internet. If you buy something on Main Street, America, you have to pay the sales tax. But if you buy it on the Internet, there is no tax. It is a free ride. Don't tax the Internet. And by the way, don't hold me liable. Let's legalize negligence. Let's legalize fraud, with this particular bill, and then just repeal the tort system. 
   This is a sad day for the Senate to come here with this particular conference report and talk in terms of a victory for America. It is a real bad setback by the White House, the leadership--not on the House side, I can tell you that. We have struggled over this thing. I tried to hold it up as much as I could, but the die has been cast. 
   I will retain at this particular point the remainder of my time.

You don't send five veto messages and then come with a sorry bill, a worse compromise. It is obvious. You can look at it on the face of it. It did not take care of the consumers. Senator LEAHY tried to. It was what we adopted in the Congress last year, in the securities bill, in the other measure; we always take care of the consumers. But here the one group penalized, sidelined, damaged, if you please, are the consumers of America.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. We go to what we knew. They made the agreement, it was all signed up, and after the agreement was sent over to the White House, it was not what they agreed to even then. I read:  
   The agreed-upon changes were translated into legislative language extremely narrowly, threatening the effectiveness of the negotiating protections. Nonetheless, we have concluded that, with these changes ..... [we are going to sign the bill].  
   They were going to sign a bill. They were going to get a bill for the Vice President. We have to get this Silicon money. And they ought to be taken to task for this kind of performance here. We know what this is about. Like I say, no State, no Governor, no Attorney General, no legislature supports this effort. Let say that my distinguished friend from Connecticut is very effective. He says: What a radical idea when we have a unique problem. 
   No, not at all. I am reading from the American Bar Association, all the lawyers:  
   Traditionally, legal principles governing both tort and contract actions have been the province of the States.   
   Not the Federal Government. We all know that.  
   The legal issues likely to be presented by the year 2000 problem are not unique.  
   We know that. He said it is not unique, it is not a radical idea, it is not a radical idea to say what is wrong, specify in your complaint what is wrong. When the computer breaks down, I don't know what is wrong. Who does? It is like in the Food and Drug Administration, when there is bad food we have good product liability; we have a Food and Drug Administration. These products they have within their own purview, the proprietary information on the manufacturer, so if there is a product that breaks down, they know where it is. We cannot find it ordinarily. But here, they really sidelined middle America, consumers and the poor small businessman. 
   They said that is a radical idea. It is a radical idea. It goes against the entire thrust of the safety principles we experience here in America. We have a safe society. You can depend on the food. You can depend on the products. The European Union is now following strict liability and joint and several liability that we have here in America. A radical idea to run to the courthouse? We are not running to the courthouse. 
   It is a litigious society, but we will show tort claims are down and business suing business is up; domestic cases, rights cases for this right, that wrong; environment and otherwise, are up. But tort liability cases are down. 
   This here really legalizes torts, it legalizes negligence, it legalizes fraud, all in the name of something that happens 6 months from now when, by their own measure they say we ought to have 90 days to fix it. Unreasonable? The Senator from California, she came and said: Let's get rid of all the lawyers, just use those 90 days to require the manufacturer to fix it; that's all we need. We need to get back in business. We do not need a rush to the courthouse. 
   Rush to the courthouse? That implies you are going to get a rush judgment. Try to get 12 jurors to agree on anything today. You cannot get 12 Senators. 
   They surely have gotten something very easily. Surely, it was not unreasonable to at least say you have to fix the problem, in return for expansive restrictions on plaintiffs' rights. 
   Instead, they say you have to find out what is wrong and specify it before they do anything. Come on. They say that is in behalf of the consumers of America? And that is a good measure and it is a victory for America? No, Mr. President; this is a sad day when the moneys in campaigns are not just taken to get elected, are not taken just to buy the office, but when they buy the principles in order to cater to a crowd to pass this kind of legislation. 
   How much time remains?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, S. 1312, the Telecommunications Competition Enforcement Act of 1999. 
   The United States has a telecommunications system that is unequaled. We have worked hard to ensure that consumers in all parts of the country have access to this system and enjoy services at an affordable price. Therefore, when the Bell companies asked us to allow them to enter the long distance market, it was with great caution that we began to develop policies that would change the existing framework. We did not want to jeopardize existing service as we phased in competition into local markets and allowed local phone companies to enter the long distance market. 
   Bell companies worked with Congress to create the fourteen point checklist and they celebrated the passage of the 1996 Act. They then filed applications with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enter the long distance market. However, the FCC found that the Bell companies had not opened their local markets to competition, and therefore, under the 1996 Act, could not enter the long distance market. Once the Bell companies realized that they were not going to get into the long distance market before they complied with the 1996 Act, they began a strategy of litigation to delay competition into their local markets and hold on to their monopolies. They appealed the FCC's decisions to the Court of Appeals and challenged the constitutionality of the Act taking their case to the Supreme Court. Having lost in those forums they have now come to Congress seeking changes to the Act that only three years ago they championed. As a result bills have been introduced in the Senate and the House that significantly amend the 1996 Act, harm competition in the local markets, and slow the delivery of advanced, affordable services to consumers. 
   Therefore, I introduce this legislation as part of a continuing effort to promote competition in the local telecommunications markets. I am frustrated by the broken promises of the Bell companies given that not a single Bell company has adequately opened its local phone market to competition since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. According to wall street analysts, as of the end of last year new entrants had only 2.5 percent of all access lines while Bell companies and incumbent local exchange carriers continued to control over 97 percent of those lines into the home. 
   Three years ago when we passed the 1996 Act, Bell companies proclaimed that they would open their markets immediately and begin competing. In fact, they and their lawyers helped write the 14 point checklist--their roadmap into the long distance market in their region. All these companies have to do to provide long distance service in their regions is to follow that roadmap and meet the requirements of Section 271. 
   I remember the excitement by the local phone companies at the time of the 1996 Act. On March 5, 1996, Bell South-Alabama President, Neal Travis, stated that the ``Telecommunications Act now means that consumers will have more choices ..... We are going full speed ahead ..... and within a year or so we can offer [long distance] to our residential and business wireline customers.'' 
   And, on February 8, 1996, USWest's President of Long Distance, Richard Coleman, issued this statement: ``The Inter-LATA long distance potential is a tremendous business opportunity for USWest. Customers have made it clear they want one-stop shopping for both their local and long distance service. We are preparing to give them exactly what they've been asking for.'' He went on to predict that USWest would meet the 14 point checklist in a majority of its states within 12-18 months. 
   Ameritech's chief executive office, Richard Notebaert February 1, 1996,  noted his support of the 1996 Act by stating that, ``[t]he real open competition this bill promotes will bring customers more choices, competitive prices and better quality services ..... [T]his bill will rank as one of the most important and far-reaching pieces of federal legislation passed this decade ..... It offers a comprehensive communications policy, solidly grounded in the principles of the competitive marketplace. It's truly a framework for the information age.'' 
   Those were the statements of the local phone companies in 1996. What has happened since then? The answer is very little. In fact, rather than meet their promises, the local phone companies were in federal court challenging the FCC's implementation of the Act less than one year after its enactment. In addition, only five applications for Section 271 relief have been filed at the FCC--and none have met the requirements of section 271. On more than one occasion, the FCC's decision to deny a 271 application has been upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court. One of the regional Bell companies even challenged the constitutionality of section 271--a challenge the court of appeals denied and the Supreme Court refused to hear. Today, there are no 271 applications on file at the FCC and not a single application has been presented to the FCC since July 1998. 
   What this means for the customer is that the choice and the local competition we tried to create with the passage of the Telecommunications Act has been thwarted by the very companies that promised to compete. Instead, they have chosen to litigate, complain, and combine. Just two days ago, the Chairman of the FCC decided to grant SBC and Ameritech approval to merge their operations. In permitting the merger to go forward, the FCC has conditioned approval on future performance--performance which SBC has not met in the three years since the passage of the 1996 
   Act. In fact, on the same day conditional approval of the SBC and Ameritech merger was announced, SBC agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle disputes surrounding alleged violations of sections of the 1996 Act dealing with the provision of long distance service. One company will now control one-third of all access lines in the United States even though its market is not open to competition. Competition again becomes a casualty of the unwillingness of Bell companies, to open their markets and let go of their monopolies. 
   Today, there are companies seeking to connect to the Bell networks and provide service to consumers. However, these companies often times experience significant difficulties in obtaining access to these networks. Thus, while I applaud the efforts of the competitive local exchange carriers, long distance carriers, and the cable industry to provide facilities-based local competition, I must express my disappointment that not a single regional bell operating company has sufficiently opened its markets to competition. 
   Since the beginning of this Congress, many of the Bell companies have been meeting with Senators and Representatives, often accompanied by the same lawyers who helped write the Telecommunications Act. But this time their message is different. They are asking us to change the rules of the game. They now want to offer lucrative high-speed data services for long distance customers without first having to open their local markets to competition. They maintain that they should be permitted to continue their hold on the local customer as they provide data services because the 1996 Act did not contemplate the provision of such services. To state it plainly--they are wrong. The Telecommunications Act clearly contemplated the provision of advanced services--data and otherwise. In fact, the Act had an entire section dedicated to promoting the development and deployment of advanced services. To quote the Act, ``advanced telecommunications capability'' is defined as ``high-speed switched, broadband telecommunications capability that enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications using any technology.'' 
   Regardless, nothing in the 1996 Act prevents phone companies from providing high speed data services to consumers inside and outside their region. They are already providing DSL service to customers inside their region. And, under the 1996 Act, Bell companies can provide long distance service in their region once they open their local markets. We must hold to this principle if we want consumers to have a choice of service providers. In fact, a number of Bell companies are working to meet Section 271 requirements. I applaud those attempts which, if successful, will ultimately provide new and innovative services at low prices to consumers. 
   Therefore, I reject their proposed legislative solutions, and instead, forward a different proposal. By 2001, five years will have passed since the Telecommunications Act became law. I believe, it is reasonable to expect Bell companies to have at least one-half of their markets in their region open to competition by 2001 and all of their markets in their region open to competition by 2003. The legislation that I introduce today accomplishs just that. My bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to assess a forfeiture penalty of $100,000 per day if a Bell operating company has not met the section 271 checklist in at least half of the states in its region by February 8, 2001--the five year anniversary of President Clinton signing the Telecommunications Act into law. Moreover, if the FCC finds that a Bell operating company has not met the section 271 checklist throughout its region by February 8, 2003, the Commission is required to order the company to divest its telecommunications network facilities within six months, in states in which it is not in compliance with the checklist. 
   With respect to non-Bell incumbent local exchange carriers with more than 5 percent of the access lines in the nation, the Commission, upon the petition of any interested party, is required to investigate whether the carrier's markets are open to competition to determine whether such carrier has complied with the interconnection requirements of the Act. A determination that such an incumbent local exchange company has not opened its markets shall result in a $50,000 per day forfeiture penalty, to be imposed by the FCC, if the company does not come into compliance within 60 days. In addition, the FCC shall order the company to cease and desist in marketing and selling long distance services to new customers, if it has not complied within the 60 day grace period. 
   Lastly, to protect competition once the Bell companies have met the section 271 checklist requirements, this bill provides the FCC with additional enforcement tools. If, at some point after meeting the checklist requirements, a Bell company fails to meet one or more provisions of the checklist, the FCC shall impose a forfeiture penalty of $100,000 for each day of the continuing violation. Moreover, if, after meeting the checklist requirements, the Bell company willfully, knowing, and repeatedly fails to meet one or more provisions of the checklist, the FCC shall require the Bell company, within 180 days, to divest its telecommunications network facilities in states in which the repeated violations have occurred. 
   While these penalties may appear severe, severe action needs to be taken to force dominant market providers to open their markets to competition. During the debate over the Telecommunications Act, we did not include such a strong approach. Rather, we settled on a rational and reasonable set of procedures--endorsed by the local phone monoplies--that provided incentives to open their local markets while preserving the integrity of the premier communications networks in the world. 
   That approach seemed particularly palatable in light of the statements issued at the time of enactment of the 1996 Act by the local phone companies promising an early opening of the local phone market pursuant to the requirements of the Section 271 checklist. 
   Today, our communications networks remain the envy of the world and the development of innovative advanced services is accelerating rapidly. Unfortunately, the rollout of those services on a competitive basis to all Americans is being thwarted by the failure of Bell companies to open their markets to competition. Those same monopolists told us their markets  would be open months ago. This legislation seeks to hold them to their word.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my esteemed former colleague, Ambassador Jim Sasser. He will soon be stepping down from his post as the longest serving American Ambassador to China. But it does not seem long ago that he and I were working together on the Budget Committee where he served as the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. In fact, as we talk today of the great state of the economy, it should be former Senator Sasser that we thank for having the leadership to push through the deficit reduction package that has led to today's unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. As a former Budget Committee Chairman myself, it was with great pride that I worked side-by-side with the former Senator in the Budget Committee because I understood the great challenges that the job entailed. He did a superb job in his duties here in the Senate, and it is with the same dedication and fairness that he represented this nation so admirably in his post as the U.S. Ambassador to China. 
   I still remember vividly the front page of the newspaper a few months ago which showed Ambassador Sasser looking through the shattered window of the American Embassy. Suffice to say that Ambassador Sasser has served during some very difficult times in China-U.S. relations. Few relationships are as difficult to define and put in perspective and I think that Ambassador Sasser would agree that there is still much work to be done. But during his tenure, Ambassador Sasser was able to build consensus and to find common ground between the two nations that has allowed the relationship to prosper. Ambassador Sasser should be commended for his dedication as a gifted emissary between the world's largest developed country and the world's largest developing country. He has served the United States admirably and I commend him for his dutiful service.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank both of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   I awoke with a shock when I saw we had $1 trillion more money to spend. I go right back to 1995, just 4 years ago, when I said I will jump off the Capitol dome if this budget is balanced by the year 2002. I said to myself, it looks as if I am going to have to jump off the dome, because they found another $1 trillion. We just have surpluses everywhere. 
   I felt that way until I picked up the President's document--the budget of the U.S. Government that they gave us today, hot off the press. Turn to page 42 and Members will see the actual deficit in 1998 at the end of September was $5,478.7 trillion. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer, who is a certified public accountant, knows how to add and subtract. For the 5 years, on page 42, the total gross Federal debt goes to $6,298 trillion. The Federal debt by the year 2002 that I was worried about has already increased some $400 billion. By the year 2004, it has increased from the 1999 deficit $551.1 billion. 
   The debt is going up half a trillion, and everybody is talking surplus. That is totally dismaying to this particular Senator. It is a shabby game and a fraud that we play on the American public. The only entity to keep us honest is the free press. 
   They join in the fraud. They had a debate some years ago, between Mr. Walter Lippmann and John Dewey. This is back before the war. Lippmann's contention was that the way to really build and strengthen a democracy is to get the best of minds in the various disciplines--whether it is in medicine or whether it is in law or whether it is in finance or whether it is foreign policy--get the best of the best minds around a table, determine the needs of the country, and give it to the Congressmen and Senators and let them enact it into law. 
   John Dewey countered that. He said: No, the better way is to give the American people the truth, and the American people, in a consummate way, through their Representatives in the Congress, the House and Senate, would reflect those truths, and we would have a strong democracy. That is the way since Jefferson's time, when he said:  
   [..... as between] a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.  
   That was because he was depending, over many years--now over the 200 years we have had--on that media expounding and telling us the truth. 
   The truth is, there is nothing in the lockbox that everybody is talking about. We have been spending it--$857 billion that we owe Social Security this very minute. So there is nothing in the lockbox. You can see from this document, when they say, pay down the public debt, there is no such thing as paying down any kind of special debt. You either have a debt that increases or a debt that decreases and comes into balance. They play that shabby game called ``paying down.'' The President even said, as quoted in the New York Times this morning, that he was going to tear up the credit card. 
   What they do is transfer the debt from the general indebtedness of Government, namely for defense and spending and everything else, foreign policy and otherwise, and transfer it over to Social Security, over to the military retirees, civilian retirement, over to Medicare, because there is a surplus. So they transfer that debt into these trust funds and say that is paying down the debt. It is like having a Visa and a MasterCard and you pay off your Visa card with the MasterCard. You are still the Government. If you are still the individual, you have your individual debt; if you are still the Government, you have the Government debt. 
   One more word and I will yield with gratitude to my distinguished friend from Pennsylvania. Just turn to page 43, the next page. You can see the 15-year; they have the debt held by the Government, accounts held at the end of the period, which has to be added up with the debt held by the public at the end of the period, and you will see the debt goes up to $7.587 trillion. The debt goes up almost $2 trillion over that 15 years. 
   Fortuitously, back 4 years ago I was saying that when President Reagan came to town we had an annual budget deficit from year to year and President Reagan said: I am going to balance it the first year. Then he said: Whoops, this is worse than I ever thought; I'll do it in 3 years. Then, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we did it in 5 years. I said, before long we are going up to 10 or 15 years. And sure enough, this morning they have gone up with all kinds of estimates of revenues. 
   Really, the way to play, if you want to play this game, is let's have a 25-year budget. We will have enough money for everything. Send the money to the U.N., double the amounts to the United Nations, double the tax cut. Let's double all these things, give it all to investment accounts, health care, whatever you want. Let's have a 25-year budget and really go to spending up here. 
   It is a wonderful charade. It is a lord-awful fraud. It is only up to the media to cut out this nonsense about surplus when we are spending, this year, $100 billion more than we are taking in. It shows from the President's own figures we will continue to spend more than we take in, increasing the debt, which brings us to the $350 to $365 billion interest costs on the national debt. Before long, I am going to put in a tax allocated to really getting rid of that debt, whereby we will give a $3.5-trillion tax cut, namely, get rid of that interest cost over the 10-year period. That is the kind of tax cut the Senator from South Carolina would like. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this blasphemy--and it is blasphemy--has to stop. The Republican Party fought Social Security. They cut all the benefits back in 1986, but still they do not learn. That is how they lost the Senate at that time. Now they have been trying to privatize and get rid of Social Security. 
   This is just another charade. The Senator from New Jersey is correct, we cannot offer an amendment, for the simple reason that when they laid their bill down, they filled up the tree, and, under that premise, you cannot offer an amendment. 
   My amendment, S. 605, would be relevant to this piece of legislation. It has been referred to the Budget Committee. You cannot make it more relevant than having it referred to that committee. S. 605 creates a true lockbox. We worked it out with Ken Apfel and the Social Security Administration where we pay an equal amount of those securities back into the Social Security trust fund. 
   What does the Republican policy committee say? They take the entire debt. Mr. President, I had no idea that the Republicans would admit to the fact that there is nothing in the lockbox. Actually, at the end of this fiscal year, by the end of September--this is June--we will owe Social Security $857 billion. Read the policy committee statement. They say:  
   ..... the end of this fiscal year ..... is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $857 billion.  
   They finally admit there is nothing in the lockbox. The intent of HOLLINGS in S. 605, and others who have cosponsored it, is to put some money in the lockbox; namely, the annual surpluses. I have juxtaposed the language in my legislation but I can tell you, you can see their intent by this Republican policy committee statement. 
   The 1994 Pension Reform Act says you cannot pay off your debt with pension funds. But they have been doing that, and their particular bill continues to pay down the debt with the pension funds. They have tried to do that under the ruse that it would be terrible by calling it, what? They call it stockpiling hard currency, and it is going to wreck the world economy. 
   I wish everybody would read the talking points of the Republican Policy Committee and this nonsense they have afoot. There is not any question that they intend to spend the money. They have one sentence in here:  
   In addition, over the next 10 years ..... CBO estimates Social Security will run a surplus of $1.78 trillion. And so, the costs of this proposal are enormous.  
   Substitute the word ``savings'' for the word ``costs.'' The savings to Social Security will be enormous if we pass S. 605. But their intent is that there be nothing in the lockbox. 
   The Senator from Michigan sits down there with his senior citizen picture. I am a senior citizen. I am not worried. STROM is not worried. We are going to get our money. It is the young baby boomer generation that the Greenspan Commission said set aside for--actually section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report--that should be worried. The law, section 13301 of the Budget Act, says to do exactly that. But they continue to put this shabby act on the other side of the aisle like they have a lockbox and they are trying to save Social Security Trust Fund monies, when they know full well there is nothing in the lockbox. The Republican Policy Committee said they are guaranteeing that nothing is ever going to be in that lockbox.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today it is my great privilege and honor to salute one of my home state's legendary craftsmen, Philip Simmons, on his 87th birthday. Mr. Simmons retired in 1990 after more than 60 years as a master blacksmith in Charleston, SC. Despite his retirement, Mr. Simmons takes great pride in checking in on his shop each day, saying hello to the many workers he trained, some of them for more than 30 years, as they carry on the craft. 
   Philip Simmons' renowned ironwork is on display throughout South Carolina, including the symbolic gates to the city outside the Meeting Street Visitors Center in Charleston, at the S.C. State Museum in Columbia, and he has been inducted into the S.C. Hall of Fame in Myrtle Beach. I am also proud to say that Mr. Simmons work can be viewed here in our nation's capitol at the Smithsonian Museum. 
   The dedication, love and pride in craftsmanship displayed by Philip Simmons and passed on to his apprentices is to be saluted. Mr. Simmons is an appropriately admired member of the South Carolina family and I join his relatives, friends and admirers in wishing him a happy birthday and health and happiness in the years to come.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. 
   He and I work very closely together. The chairman of our committee has gained a reputation against charades and frauds and make-believes and pork and all these things. That is why it doesn't please this particular Senator that he would take this one on. 
   The truth of the matter is that, generally speaking, it is a nonproblem. If there is a problem, the best of the best, Intel, has a web page we lifted just yesterday afternoon entitled ``Updating Your Components, Updating Your PC Hardware.'' 
   ``If you have determined that your PC hardware is not capable of handling the century rollover''--so forth and so on, about how to manually reset and install a BIOS upgrade or patch, if available.  
   1. Manually reset the date after December 31, 1999, the first time you turn on your PC or laptop after December 31, 1999, and before you use any software applications, simply reset the operating system date on the computer. For nearly all PCs and laptops, this is the easiest and safest way to ensure the computer will handle dates properly in the year 2000. Once reset, the PC hardware clock will maintain the correct date when powered off and on or rebooted.  
   2. Install a BIOS upgrade or ``patch,'' if available if you wish to ensure that your PC hardware is capable before the new millennium begins. You may want to install a BIOS upgrade or software ``patch'' before the end of 1999. Some PC hardware manufacturers and BIOS and software vendors are offering free BIOS upgrades.  
   I was wondering, Mr. President, about the time, the minimum amount of time, as I understand, and the cost. 
   I lifted, again, in searching back in 1998, an article entitled, ``Tool fixes PC Y2K glitch,'' priced at $94.95. 
   We are hearing millions and billions and everything else, Chick Little, the sky is falling.  
   A lot of people still don't seem to realize that even though they purchase their PC in 1998, it doesn't mean that the system is compliant. There are still PCs out there that are not fully compliant. Tools like the [PCfix2000] provide users with a solution for addressing this.  
   Then they go on to describe this $94.95 fix. 
   I noticed in the month of March, on March 10 of this year:  
   The easiest way to prepare your PCs for the new millennium is with Y2K diagnostic software. We chose five sub-$50 programs that both check your computer for year 2000 compliance and solve any problems they find: Check 2000 PC Deluxe, IntelliFix 2000, Know2000, Norton 2000, and 2000 Toolbox. We scrutinized each program and, finally, chose a winner. (Mac owners: Your machines are, and always have been, free of the Y2K bug.)  
   That interested me, because we only just last week had Michael Dell of Dell Computers, the largest producers of computers in the United States, and he had advertised with the Securities and Exchange Commission that all Dell computers were Y2K compliant. 
   I ask unanimous consent, once again, to print this March issue of Business Week in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. It is very short.  
   Multinationals such as General Motors, MacDonald's, Nike, and Deere, are making the first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for partners and vendors to prove they're bug free. A recent survey by consultants Cap Gemini America says that 69% of the 2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with companies that can't pass muster. The National Federation of Independent Business figures more than 1 million companies with 100 workers or less won't make the cut and as many as half could lose big chunks of business or even fail. 
   Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the past year, Prudential Insurance has cut 9 suppliers from its critical list of 3,000 core vendors.  
   Citibank has already cut. Cuts have already been made. 
   I read further down:  
   If a vendor is not up to speed by April or May, it is a serious crunch problem. Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, General Motors and other car makers have set a March 31 deadline for vendors to become Y2K compliant. In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will meet with their counterparts from food marketing to launch similar efforts. Other companies are sending a warning to laggards and shifting business to the tech-savvy.  
   Now I quote:  
   ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize the supply chain,'' says Ronald S. Boreham, Jr., chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, Ark. 
   The World Bank shelled out millions in loans and grants to Y2K-stressed nations.  
   On and on, Mr. President. Here is another article that the banks now, by June 30, will have all of their Y2K customers and everything else compliant, or they will have cancellations. 
   Otherwise, Paul Gillin said in Computer World earlier this year:  
   Vendors have had plenty of time to prepare for 2000. The fact that some were more preoccupied with quarterly earnings and stock  options than in protecting their customers is no excuse for giving them a get-out-of-jail-free card now.  
   That is what Computer World has called the Y2K bill, I say to the distinguished Senator from Arizona--a 
   get-out-of-jail-free card--which is why I am surprised by my colleague, because he is usually on the other side. I quote again from Computer World:  
   The problem belongs--hook, line, and sinker--to the vendors that capriciously ignored warnings from as long ago as the late `70s........It has been five years since year 2000 awareness washed over the computer industry [and everyone should now be compliant].  
   I was interested that Boeing, for example--and the Senator from Washington was here debating it--started back in 1993. Everyone has done that. This is a political fix--and I will get to that in just a little while. I want to just bring you really up to date with respect to the number of cases. 
   We had a witness, Ronald Weikers, who has written Litigating Year 2000 Cases, published by the West Group. I can tell you, the West Group is not going to publish anything partisan. They have a wonderful reputation for objectivity and reliability of their reports. He says:  
   I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do not represent any clients that have any interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation.  
   Then he goes on to state:  
   Thirteen of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to date have been dismissed almost entirely.  
   I brought that 44 figure up to date because that was the end of April, just a little over a month and a half ago. It is now 50 cases. Twelve cases have been settled for moderate sums of money, or no money. The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims. They act as if the courts just love to see a frivolous claim come into the court that doesn't have any substance. All you have to do is get 12 people and, whoopee, you've got money. You race to the courthouse, see the 12 people, and you get your money. It is a total fanciful picture that is being painted with respect to this legislation.  
   The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims and Y2K legislation is therefore unnecessary.  
   So says, of course, the Washington Post; they editorialized. We included that particular item in the RECORD, with others. 
   The most recent one is by Institutional Investor, a magazine from Wall Street. They had a survey taken, and this was just this month:  
   Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are prepared to make the year 2000 transition without problems?  
   Mr. President, 88.1 percent said yes; 6 percent said no. Here we are, 5 and a half months, and now the bill. This is a wonderful problem here, and we have to give it time. In January, under the McCain bill, you get 3 months. I am giving them 5 and a half months, the operation, right now, to that 6 percent. Get with it.  
   Have you done a dry run of your computer problems for the year 2000 transition?  
   Twelve percent said no problems. Few problems: 86.4 percent. 
   Then they asked:  
   Do you expect Y2K transition problems to have a material impact on your company's business or financial performance next year?  
   Three point six percent, and we have this wonderful Federal legislation. Of course, States haven't asked for that. No 
    attorney general has ever come up here. In fact, the Conference of State Legislatures has resolved against this political fix. That is all it is, political. We will get to that in just a few minutes. 
   Only 3.6 percent said yes; 89.2 percent said no. And then 95.2 percent say they have worked with their suppliers and cleaned up the problem. 
   So here we are in June, 5 and a half months ahead of time, and we still are insisting, if you please, on the Y2K fix. 
   Let me divert for a second and get right into the matter of safety. I know it is difficult with the matter of gun violence in the schools, and everything else, for us politicians to think in terms of a safe America. But that is the fact. We have the safest society with respect to product liability. That is what this is about, the Y2K problem with your computer, a product liability. 
   Since 1963 in the McPherson case, under the common law, when the courts came in and enunciated the doctrine of strict liability, the State legislatures thereupon have followed suit, enunciating strict liability, joint and several liability, all over the land. When you buy a product, it is not caveat emptor, the buyer beware, but caveat venditor, the seller beware. They have to be responsible right down the line, because the proponents of this bill said they are going to go way down and find somebody with fat pockets, or high pockets. 
   That is total nonsense. I have a glitch on my computer now, and I know they are like fleas on a dog, and they are all rich; it is the richest crowd the world has ever produced, way better than any oil millionaires. I know they have deep pockets, but I am not racing to the courthouse. I told my secretary to get this blooming thing fixed. I have no time to run around to the courthouse. If I went to the courthouse at 12 noon, it would take until the year 2000 to get into the courthouse. File your pleadings and see how it happens. 
   The total unreality of the picture described here for the need of this particular legislation--it has worked and, yes, and the Europeans are following us, incidentally. I have the record here where they are coming along with strict liability and joint and several liability. I only mention that because they come in and say we are losing business to the Europeans. The Europeans are following America. We are setting the example for safe products in America. 
   The conference board has found that. The Rand study has found that. I could go to various others--232 risk managers; the conference board reports that the companies responded to product liability by ``making their products safer.'' So we know the effect it has had. 
   But to emphasize it, yes. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers has done a wonderful job with respect to consumers demanding a safe product, checking it out and understanding it--and various other things. The National Safety Transportation Board has come forth with various regulations, but it is really all prompted, if you please, I say to the Senator from Utah, by the trial lawyers. This town loves lawyers. That is all about lawyers. There are 60,000 of them. This town just loves lawyers. There are 60,000 to fix you and to fix me--not to get to the court. The lawyers are racing to the court around this place. I can tell you. I have been here 32 years now, and I know them. They are delightful folks. They are highly intelligent. I enjoy them. But one thing is that they have started advertising against working lawyers and the trial lawyers. 
   The lawyer that has to come in, if you please, and when he has a client that comes to him, he says first I have got to investigate and make sure the facts are as you say they are and you have been wronged. He has to pay for all the expenses of that investigation--the interrogatories, the discoveries, having to file the different pleadings, the trial of the case itself, and on appeal taking care of the briefs on appeal, the costs thereof, making of appeal and waiting for the court. And all along that so-called talented trial lawyer is rushing to the courtroom. He has to get all 12 jurors--not 11 but all 12 jurors. He has to get a majority opinion from the court. Then he gets his 20 percent or 30 percent, and these Senators run all around and saying they have a lottery, and ``strike it rich,'' and some kind of atmosphere. 
   The consumer has never been mentioned here. That is what trial lawyers represent. They do not represent themselves. They represent a wronged consumer. Ask the Consumer Federation of America. Ask Public Citizen. Ask anybody who represents consumers if they thought that this bill was appropriate. They are absolutely opposed to it, but we have them. They have been very clever in the way that they have postured this particular measure. It isn't about consumers. It isn't about wrongdoing. It isn't about need. 
   This is a measure--sooey, pig. All you computer folks come into town--you millionaires--falling over each other. Billionaires, excuse me. I don't mean to hurt their feelings. Billionaires are falling over each other because we are going to fix it for you, which reminds me; that is some crowd, isn't it? That is some crowd. They are highly intelligent. Bless their success, but that is the crowd now that wants  estate tax cuts. That is the crowd that wants capital gains tax cuts. That is the crowd that wants no tax on the Internet. What Wal-Mart has started cleaning up is Main Street. Now we are going to clean up the rest of it, because Main Street in the States and the municipalities is not going to be able to tax businesses as normal businesses on Main Street. In fact, the merchant on Main Street will say: Tell me. Yes. You want siding 42 feet long. That is fine. Let me order it. I will have it delivered tomorrow. I will order it on the Internet, and you won't have to pay the 8 percent sales tax. 
   There is the agent sitting up there in a little cubicle on Main Street, and all we have is the wig shops run up and down Main Street of America. 
   But that is the crowd that says get rid of the immigration laws. They have been spoiled. They have been told that money can buy anything. Get rid of the estate taxes, capital gains taxes, the immigration laws, and now get rid of the liability laws--200 years of State liability laws for wrongdoers--and instead they 
   are saying the wronged injured party now has to pay for the misdeeds of the wrongdoer. 
   I go back to placing emphasis on the point: I want to join on the issue about these lawyers. It was Mark Robinson back in the 1970s who brought the Pinto case wherein the gasoline tank exploded. It was negligently and willfully proved that they knew it was unsafe, but they figured that the extra little cost from a market cost-benefit analysis that they weren't going to put in the safe gas tank. 
   He got a verdict in that death case of $3 1/2 million and $125 million punitive damages 20 years ago. He collected zero of his punitive damages. He never got a red cent. But pick up the morning paper or yesterday's paper, pick up any news edition and you will find recalls. 
   I went to the National Transportation Safety Board. As of 1994--in the last 4 years--there have been 73 million recalls on account of the Pinto case, on account of trial lawyers. You break that down to $1.8 million, or $18 million each year, $50,000 a day, and 5 percent of the $50,000 would be death, the other 95 percent in injury, and Mark Robinson saved 2,500 people from being killed as of today. He ought to be proud of it. Every trial lawyer who works that hard knows he is taking a risk, and he has to convince by the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence all 12 jurors. He has to be studied and careful and legally sound and prevail on appeal. He is taking care of all the costs, and out of it the average American gets a good lawyer. They do not like good lawyers. They like office lawyers that fix you and me. They don't like working lawyers. 
   So all of us, this thing about running to the courthouse, race to the courthouse, and everything else, we put it to bed. 
   Under our system, torts have been relegated to the States. I would think the contract crowd would understand that. If I remember it, they came to town in 1995 and said the best government is the least government; the best government is closest to the people--the 10th amendment, the rights of the States. Even then the first thing they passed was to make sure the States were made whole. What did they call that thing? Unfunded mandates. That was it. Yes. Unfunded mandates. They wanted to make sure they would take care of the State communities. The States have been administering. They have been doing it on Y2K. Everyone is taking up the Y2K. They don't live in an isolation booth. The people are close to their government at the local level, and all of them have been hearing about this particular problem. It has been advertised. 
   Incidentally, my distinguished friends, the Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, have performed yeomen service in bringing attention to this particular problem. But the States have been administering this, whereby you have to be a accountable for your wrongful acts. Having done so, we have a safe America with the States having administered properly their product liability law. They have refused every time--and this has been going on for 20 years--to get the Federals to come in. 
   Here were the States asking not to do it. No State attorney general has come up and asked for it. No State Governor has said it is inadequate, and we need a Federal statute. Here they want to do away with 200 years of liability law at the State level. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Look here. All we have to do is get yesterday's New York Times, June 14. On the front, left-hand column, ``Congress Chasing Campaign Donors Early and Often.'' The money chase. If you have any doubt about that, just the day before, on Sunday in the Washington Post, a two-column story appears on two pages, ``GOP Vies for Backing of High-Tech Leaders.'' ``Party aims to exploit Y2K vote at CEO summit.'' 
   That is why they have all of them in town. This is a disgrace. This crowd has gone so political about message, message, message, they got the message together, but they say: Now, wait a minute. 
   Senator MCCAIN and Senator HOLLINGS were ready for a final vote at 12:30 last Thursday, but we have to wait 5 days because you have to have a message but you have to have it timely. 
   Guess who is in town this afternoon when we vote. Bill Gates of Microsoft. You want me to call the roll? Want to hear a bird call? Here we go. 
   John Warnock of Adobe system, Carol Bartz of Autodesk, Greg Bentley of Bentley Systems, Michael Cowpland of Corel Corporation, Dominique Goupil of FileMaker, Bill Harris of Intuit, Jeff Papows of Lotus Development, Bill Gates of Microsoft, William Larson of Network Associates, Eric Schmidt of Novell, John Chen of Sybase, John Thompson of Symantec Corporation, and Jeremy Jaech of Visio Corporation. 
   Of course, we have some that we could not get to meet with us, I guess--like Netscape. 
   I saw Barksdale on TV, and I saw the head of IBM, Gerstner. They were on my morning TV. They are all in town. 
   I thought this was the most amusing thing I had ever seen. I lifted this--I had to scroll it down word for word. Turn on channel 2, the TV here, which is the Republican screen of what is going on. I read it word for word: Senate again attempts to end minority stranglehold--the great Y2K money chase. 
   That is the first time an outreach, bag in hand, has ever been called a ``stranglehold.'' We have been begging, trying to get a little bit of the crumbs from Silicon Valley. We have to run, too. We have never been against technology. I am the author of the Advanced Technology Program. I am the author of the Manufacturers Extension Partnership Program. It all works. It was supported by the electronics industry, the technology industry. It is working extremely well. We are trying to expand it. 
   I would love to get Mr. Gates and Microsoft to South Carolina. I don't speak in a disparaging way. I speak in an adoring way. But don't come here with the screen about stranglehold. 
   We have the Federal Election Campaign Commission. Last year, according to their records: 
   Intel, Andy Grove, hard money, the Democrats got $16,000; the Republicans got $64,000. 
   Microsoft, the Democrats got $71,000, and the Republicans got $143,000. 
   Soft money, Microsoft, the Democrats got $135,000; the Republicans got $629,000. 
   This is usually a performance of my distinguished chairman from Arizona, because I have heard him and he is very effective. 
   I am just shocked he is not doing this and I am forced to do it. 
   I could go down the list here. Computer Services Corporation, the Democrats, $25,000; the Republicans, $53,000. 
   Microtech, Democrats, soft money, zero; Republicans, $16,000. 
   Advanced Micro Devices, soft money, the Democrats got $1,000; the Republicans, $95,000. 
   I have the list. You can go over there. 
   Stranglehold? Come on, give me a break. 
   Here is what they are doing. They come here. We all have to run. So we create a problem. We raise a straw man of trial lawyers. We don't talk about consumers. We don't talk about the wrongdoing. We don't talk about trial lawyers representing wrongdoers. They are not just running around with frivolous cases. That is an imaginary thing that could be brought at the political level but not at our level, I can tell you that. Trial lawyers worth their salt are  not fooling around. They have to make a living. They don't run up and down and ruin their reputation. You know they are not getting anywhere. The courts take care of the frivolous charges. They raise that thing and they are saying: Here is what we are going to do; we are going to get rid of the lawyer. 
   It was very obvious in the debate how they are going to get rid of the lawyer. They said get rid of economic damages. If you come in with a $10,000 or $20,000 computer and that is all you are limited to, that is all you can recover. 
   What I have just described--for the investigation, the pleadings, the interrogatories, the depositions, the trial, the appeal, the cost, the time--as a lawyer, I would tell my secretary up front, if they come in, tell them those are very complicated cases and there are a lot of legal loopholes to go through and delays, and we are just not in a position to handle those cases. 
   That is the way to get rid of the lawyer. They know exactly what they are doing. 
   When Senator EDWARDS of North Carolina came up and said, wait a minute, you can't do that, the Senator from Oregon said, we will give you exactly whatever the contract. You don't contract for torts. You don't say, we are going to contract for the wrongdoing; the contract is complied with. 
   If they defraud you, if they engage in wrongdoing, while the computer is down you are losing your customers to your competition, you are losing your business, you may have to let go of some of your good employees to tide yourself over. 
   All the time that business has to wait--and a small business at that--I can tell you right now, there will be serious economic damages. 
   If there is any doubt about it--because that is what small business wants. They don't want a law case; they want it fixed--up comes the Senator from California, Senator BOXER. She said: Don't give us trials, don't give us lawyers; just get a fix. 
   They denied that in an up-and-down vote. They said instead of fixing the computer, we are going to fix the lawyers; we are going to fix the system. 
   Just like any car dealer who comes around, what we are going to do is take your junk off the shelves and sell it; don't worry about it, because the law will protect you for 3 years. You can get rid of all your old models. Don't worry about it. Get rid of the junk. We will repeal the 
    liability bill. We will say that fraud pays for the first time in America. 
   No one is going to get these cases. That is what they will do. I can see exactly what was happening with that particular witness from New Jersey who came before the committee. He bought an update that was represented to last for 10 years. Within a year he found out it wasn't Y2K compliant. He paid $13,000. He called them twice and nothing ever happened. He wrote a letter. They finally came back and said they would make it Y2K compliant, for $25,000. That was after he got a lawyer and it went on the Internet and some 17,000 similarly situated people filed, and that particular manufacturer, supplier, came back and said they would fix it for nothing and pay legal fees. 
   You can see the game that business will play on a cost-benefit basis. We live in a rough world, but we have a responsibility in American society. It is done well at the State level and has worked well at the State level. No State has asked for this particular measure. Instead, the Association of State Legislatures has resolved against the Federal Y2K bill. 
   But they have the audacity to come up here and raise a straw man of lawyers running to the courthouse, in a litigious society and all of that nonsense, 5 1/2 months ahead of time, and insisting on passing this particular measure, and insisting on the time of its passage is when the computer folks are in town so they will know who delivered the goods. 
   I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is a very serious moment for the Senate in that we now are going to legalize negligence and legalize fraud. How does this come about? It is very interesting that the industry itself says 90 percent have no Y2K problems at all. Only 6 percent here, in this month's Investors Business Daily, said that 5 1/2 months ahead of that they could possibly have any problem. Straussman of Xerox said it is managerial incompetence not to have it fixed by now. We still have 5 1/2 months. 
   We are acting in spite of the fact that the States have been not only doing an outstanding job with respect to product liability but also with respect to Y2K, and in spite of the Conference of Chief Justices' resolve against this measure.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. We are acting in spite of the fact that no attorney general, no Governor, or any other entity has come up and asked for it. Then the question is, Why do we, at the Federal level, rush to suspend 200 years of State law? 
   Right to the headline here in the Washington Post, ``GOP Voice For Backing Of High Tech Leaders. Party Aims To Exploit Y2K Vote, CEO Summit.'' And yesterday morning's New York Times, the headline, ``Congress Chasing Campaign Donors Early And Often.'' 
   If you look on the Republican screen, it says there:  
   Senate again attempts to end minority stranglehold--the great Y2K money chase.  
   There it is. This crowd, they want to do away with estate taxes, capital gains taxes, immigration laws, now the State liability laws. If this thing works, I am going to put in an exemption for the corporate tax. 
   You know, they rebuilt America--not us, who back in 1993 even taxed Social Security, cut 300,000 employees, raised taxes some $250 billion and cut spending $250 billion so the economy could recover. 
   In spite of all that--so the economy could recover, so you could buy these computers and everything else of that kind--what is happening here is they do not even want a fix. The Senator from California just says, ``Let's just get a fix. Get rid of the lawyers.'' They  voted it down. ``Let's just help the consumers,'' said Senator LEAHY. They voted that down. 
   What they are trying to do is not get a fix but, rather, fix the system. They know how to do it. They suspend economic losses. I practiced law, and I can tell you here and now what will happen if all you can get is, say, two-thirds of the cost of your computer because--after I bring the investigation, the pleadings, discovery, interrogatories, trial, appeal, and convince 12 jurors--after I have done all of that, I am deserving of at least 20 or 30 percent. So I have to tell the client that is the best you can do after a year in court and everything else of that kind. I have never seen such a thing in my life. 
   This is a bad bill. We could have passed a good one. We could have gotten alternative dispute resolution. We could have done this in a bipartisan fashion, as we did last year. We could have done this as I did with the aircraft bill, which I voted for, or the securities bill, which I voted for. But they would not let us. They wanted that computer money.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is no question that the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT, have done yeomen work in alerting the land with respect to the potential Y2K changeover as of January 1, 2000. Pursuant to their diligent work, we have had hearings in  several of the committees. We have had laws passed now that allowed the parties to communicate with each other without fear of antitrust violations so they could go ahead and work to make sure that everyone was Y2K compliant. 
   I only came to the floor just momentarily, hearing about predatory law exercises, exercises of predatory law practices and otherwise you get what you get under the contract. The atmosphere or environment is totally out of sorts. We are hearing about a litigious society. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut again and again said, and I noted the expressions I was looking for in the morning Record: ``running to the courthouse,'' ``race to the courthouse,'' ``rushing to the courthouse,'' on and on. Again: ``shopping around to find someone with deep pockets,'' ``glitches.'' 
   I have a glitch on my computer right now, and I know they have deep pockets, but I am not rushing to the courthouse. People who have computers want to do business. They rely on the computers for the procedures and the progress of their interests. Having practiced law actively in the courtroom for 20 years, I can tell you nobody rushes to the courthouse. Try a rush beginning this afternoon and you will find yourself standing in line. All the civil dockets and criminal dockets are full. 
   This panorama and environment painted by the proponents of this legislation is all out of sorts with reality. Tort claims are down. All the surveys we have had at the hearings show that tort claims are down. It is a litigious society. Everybody is suing everybody for sex discrimination or age discrimination or racial discrimination and various other suits that were unheard of 30 years ago and are now abundant on the docket. But with respect to claims, tort claims, if this afternoon I brought a summons and complaint on behalf of my distinguished chairman, I would be lucky if I could get to the courthouse during the year 1999. That is the reality. 
   Incidentally, the cases they talk about--litigious, frivolous cases and spurious charges and those kinds of things--and trial lawyers, they try to fit trial lawyers in there like they prey; ``predatory'' is the word used by my chairman. Trial lawyers have no time for fanciful or spurious claims whatsoever. They know when they get the client, the client does not have any money for billable hours. On the contrary, the client principally has to rely on the lawyer's faith in the claim of the client in order to take care of all the charges, all the expenses of interrogatories, discovery, the pleadings, the filings, the motions, the trial itself. And when you come to verdicts, mind you me, those who bring the claim have to get all 12 jurors by a greater weight or the preponderance of the evidence making that finding; 11 to 1 is a mistrial. So you have to get all 12 and you have to be sure there is no error within the trial. 
   All along, the expenses are taken care of. That is what nonpluses this particular individual Senator, in the sense I am surrounded here in the District of Columbia with 60,000 billable hour boys running around talking about ``litigious society,'' ``predatory practices,'' ``rushing to the courthouse,'' ``racing to the court,'' ``running to the courthouse,'' ``shopping around.'' Here is 59,000 lawyers registered to practice in the District of Columbia who will never see a courthouse. They will see a Congress. They will see you and me, the jurors. We are supposed to be fixed, so they work on fixing juries and running around spreading rumors and doing a favor here and getting a favor there. So that is the real world we live in. 
   But to paint this legislation as doing away with predatory practices and racing to the courthouse and running to the courthouse? You have a $10,000 or $20,000 computer, if you are a doctor and you have a computer, and you want it fixed. You do not want a trial. They have made it so you are bound to go out of business and not get a lawyer, if you cannot get any damages, economic damages. 
   The distinguished Senator from Oregon, again and again and again, says: Get what the contract says, get what the contract says, billable hours, get what the contract says. If you go buy a computer and get a warranty--and that is the contract--it is only for a certain period of time and everybody reads that warranty quick. Who says anything about economic damages? It will say something about a sound article for a sound price and they will give you some repairs after you stand in line, and so forth. But with respect to your standing in line and waiting, under this bill for 90 days, you are broke. You are out of business. You are closed down. You have lost your customers. This is a fast-moving world in which we live and small business, with all the competition, does not have in-house counsel on retainer, on billable hours, just as all the computer companies do that are force-feeding this particular measure. 
   That is why the Senator from South Carolina gets annoyed with the entire thrust of the measure. 
   With respect to its needs, let's go to the record. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission, all publicly listed companies, through their 10(k) reports to the SEC, give notice to the stockholders of the state of readiness, the worst case scenario, or the risk involved, the contingency plans to comply with any potential Y2K problem, and the cost. Many of them, most all of them--I do not know any privately. I talked with the gentleman from Yahoo. Four years ago, he was a Stanford student, and now he is well along the way. I admire him because, unlike AOL, America Online, that everybody is hugging and loving around here, dining and wining and traveling out to Virginia, Yahoo does not charge. America Online is trying for a monopoly. The cable folks have around 300,000 to 400,000; America Online has 17 million, and their push for openness, openness, openness means: Let me make sure I retain my monopoly. 
   In any event, all of these are publicly held companies and they are burdened with that duty, and this has been going on. We act like everything with Y2K is going to happen tomorrow. The bill gives them 90 days. We are going to give them 180 days. Tell them to go ahead and fix it. Call up everybody now; test it; find out if it is Y2K compliant. 
   I look forward to meeting some of these company people later today. Cisco Systems, as of December 1998, a year and a half ago: Current products are largely compliant in their 10(k) report to the SEC. 
   Yes, here it is. Dell Computer. Here is a distinguished gentleman who has made a tremendous success. He deserves every bit of credit. I am not talking in a cursory or derogatory fashion. I am talking in an admiring fashion. I love success and particularly business success. I give him every bit of respect. Dell Computer, as of December 14, 1998, in their report: All products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K certified, I say to the Senator from Oregon. I want him to hear that. We have it here. Dell Computer, one of the best, as of December 14, 1998, all products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K certified. 
   General Electric: A complete analysis of the microprocesses; Y2K compliant as of November 12, 1998. 
   Intel Corporation: The company has assessed the ability of its products to handle the Y2K issue and developed the list, published it and support follows. As of November 10, 1998, they will be in compliance. Deployment, integration tested, will be completed by mid-1999. 
   I do not have their mid-1999 report, but that is what they reported to their stockholders. That is where lawyers look at these things. 
   Incidentally, this Senator voted for the Securities and Exchange Commission reform with respect to the excessive reading of these filings and bringing any and every charge as a result of 10(k) filings. We did not want to require the filing and just lay the groundwork for predatory legal practices. I helped the distinguished Senator, Nancy Kassebaum, pass the airplane tort liability bill. I have been on both sides of this fence. But they have me categorized, and I love it. 
   The truth is, Yahoo systems are currently Y2K compliant in all respects. That is February 26, 1999. 
   Even writing a book with respect to this is very 
   interesting. The book, to be published later on this summer, by Eamonn Fingleton, is ``In Praise of Hard Industries.'' I quote from page 65:  
   A major part of the problem is that corporate America's top executives have not been monitoring their information technology departments as closely as they should. As Paul A. Strassmann has pointed  out, the millennium problem, for instance, is stunning evidence of ``managerial laxity.'' In his book, The Squandered Computer, Strassmann comments: ``There is absolutely no justification for allowing this condition to burst to executive attention at this late stage.'' 
   According to Strassmann, a former chief information officer of Xerox Corporation, the computer software industry should have started getting ready for the new millennium by the early 1970s, if not the mid-1960s. He gives short shrift to the software industry's excuse that the millennium bug arose because programmers were legitimately concerned about economizing on computer space. He maintains that such economizing was justifiable only in the very earliest days of computerization, the era of punched cards, which ended in the mid-1960s. ``The insistence on retaining for more than thirty years a calendar recording system that everyone knew would fail after December 31, 1999, is inexcusable management.''  
   There you go. Here they come up with Chicken Little, the sky is falling, predatory law practice, racing to, running to the courthouse, whoopee to the courthouse, a total fanciful background that does not exist. 
   Let me come up to date. What is this? I never have read it before, but I learn. The May 1999 issue of Institutional Investors. This crowd does nothing but make money and sit around and punch. The article, on page 31, ``Y2K? Why not?''.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Presiding Officer.  
   These worries notwithstanding, most U.S. companies appear to believe they have the Y2K problem licked. A resounding 88.1 percent of the chief financial officers responding to this month's CFO Forum expect that their companies will make the transition to the next century without any computer problems. Just as important, CFOs know that outside contacts must be ready as well, and 95.2 percent say they have worked with suppliers to that end. Nearly 73 percent of the respondents are convinced that their suppliers and clients will be prepared for the year 2000; only 4.8 percent worry that suppliers or clients won't be ready.  
   Now we are going to change 200 years of tort law for 4.8 percent that still have 180 days, and the law does not give them but 90. So they must think something can happen in 90 days. We can double that. You like 90; I give you 180. Start right now. You don't have to do that. The market will take care of it, as Business Week says it is doing. 
   I quote further:  
   Such is the CFOs' confidence that 62.7 percent of respondents believe that failures of a millennial computer crisis are overblown. And as for those predictions of economic recession, not a single CFO responding to the survey agrees.  
   This prediction had been made some months back, last year sometime by Yardeni, a respected economist. I remember the gentleman because I was at the hearings when he used to be with Chase Manhattan. He talked that it could even cause a recession.  
   Not a single CFO responding to the survey agrees with that. Admits economist Yardeni, ``I seem to be the only one on this planet who thinks we'll have any chance of a recession, let alone a severe one.''  
   Tell Yardeni to come to the Congress. The majority around here knows we are going to have a recession--predatory practices, racing to the courthouse. There would just be a jam to get the business. 
   I quote:  
   He suspects that CFOs are relying too much on their tech departments' reassurances. ``I wish there was more verification of these happy tales *.*.*.'' 
   Time will tell.  
   Here is the question that is printed in the particular article:  
   Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are prepared to make the year-2000 transition without problems?  
   The answer is: 88.1 percent said yes; 6 percent said no. 
   Next question:  
   Have you done a dry run of your computer systems for the year-2000 transition?  
   The answer is: 80.2 percent said yes; 19.8, no. 
   So four-fifths have already been testing as a result of the fine work by the Senator from Utah and the Senator  from Connecticut and, of course, our distinguished Senator on the Judiciary Committee, Chairman HATCH, and Senator LEAHY of Vermont. 
   Then you go down there: 
   What have you done? 
   They have all kinds of things down here: 86 percent bought new software. You see Dell and Intel and everybody else, they are certifying that when the purchase is made, this is Y2K compliant. Business is business. They cannot be playing around 
   with monkey shines waiting on politicians in Washington to change the tort law. They have good sense. That is why they are successful.  
   Do you expect the Y2K transition problems to have a material impact on your company's business or financial performance next year?  
   The answer: 3.6 percent said yes; 89.2 percent said no.  
   Do you think the fears of a year-2000 crisis are overblown [in the business world]?  
   They give you a long list. You know how chambers of commerce work. They are stupid enough, by gosh, to give me a medal this year for last year when they are opposing me in the election. So don't tell me about the Chamber of Commerce. You are looking at the fellow with the Enterprise Award from the National Chamber of Commerce. But last year I got the stinkbomb. I can tell you that right now. 
   They send around letters and leaches and everything that I was terrible for business. So don't listen to all the letters about all of those places. None of those State chambers of commerce is complaining. I notice they got one from South Carolina. They don't know from sic'em down there about Y2K. That is one place. 
   You don't have to worry about what the State of North Carolina does. They will be ready come next month. They had a recent article--just yesterday morning; I should have brought that to the floor--that they are all in shape and ready to go. But for all the cases, the best I have heard, as my distinguished chairman mentioned, 80 cases--I have not been able to find that. The best authority has said that is mixed in with some other cases. 
   The most recent information--and brought right up to date --is the letter a month ago by Ronald Weikers who appeared before our committee, an attorney at law. Let me qualify him. The gentleman says here in this letter:  
   I have studied the Y2K problem carefully from the legal perspective, and have written a book entitled ``Litigating Year 2000 Cases'', which will be published by West Group in June. I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do not represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation. Feel free to call me, should you have any questions.  
   He starts off the letter:  
   Thank you for speaking with me earlier. Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits--  
   This is as of April 26--  
   Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to date have been dismissed entirely or almost entirely.  
   There is a court system, undescribed, or improperly described, by Senators on the floor of the Senate. The court generally does not have stumblebums just sitting up there and all rushing to the courtroom: Let me give you 12 people, and here is your money, and let's go. They test the truth of all the allegations, and even agreeing with all your allegations, you still do not have a case in court. 
   Thirteen of them have already been dismissed. 
   Twelve (12) cases have been settled for moderate sums or for no money. 
   They are not deep-pocket cases.  
   The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims, and Y2K legislation is therefore unnecessary. 
   Thirty-five (35) cases have been filed on behalf of corporate entities, such as health care providers, retailers, manufacturers, service providers and more. Nine (9) cases have been filed on behalf of individuals. This trend will continue. Thus, the same corporations that are lobbying for Y2K legislation may be limiting their own rights to recover remediation costs or damages.  
   That is signed by Ronald N. Weikers. We asked yesterday, and he has updated the 44 to 50. He has added six more since that time, which we have here for the record. 
   So there is all the law and the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring that you notify your stockholders about any and all problems, and what are you doing about it, and the potential costs. And there is all of the debate in Congress, and the special law passed this year, and everything else like that. 
   Those who usually are on the side of corporate America--even the Washington Post says let's not just be jumping around passing laws. That is the most irritating thing. I cannot get anything done with the budget. Here we are spending over $200 billion more than we are taking in, and everybody is talking about: The surplus, the surplus, the surplus. It is not just the $127 billion from Social Security, it is the money from the Senators' retirement fund, the civil service retirement fund, the military retirees, the highway trust fund, the airport trust fund, the Federal Financing Bank. Medicare moneys are being used for Kosovo. Think of that, Senators. 
   But everybody is talking about whether we are going to have a spending cut or spending increase or tax cut because of the fat surpluses. I hope they will bring that thing up. I cannot get anything done about that. I can't get anything done about campaign finance. I was here when we passed it in 1974, 25 years ago. It was a good law. It did away with soft money, no cash, everything on top of the table, and limited spending in elections. Senator THURMOND and I could have had about 670,000 registered voters. Let's double it to 1 1/2 million, 2 million. I just had to spend $5.5 million to come back here and make this talk. 
   I can tell you here and now, this thing is outrageous, because I am spending all my time racing around the country. Talk about small business. Raise in a year and a half to 2 years 5 1/2 million with shares of stock in general at $100 a share. That is a pretty good business. Don't tell this politician about small business. I am a small businessman. We had to raise that money, but it is a disgrace. 
   We can't get anything done. Fortunately, I supported McCain-Feingold. Senator MCCAIN now has joined me on my constitutional amendment, one line: The Congress is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. In fact, the States like it so much we added the States are able to control spending in State elections. Thereby, we immediately go back and we make constitutional the original act, or whatever they want to do. It doesn't disturb McCain-Feingold. We can still proceed with that and not hear the argument of the Senator from Kentucky about whether it is issue oriented or candidate oriented. All that is subjective. We will know, once we pass McCain-Feingold, it is constitutional; that we hadn't wasted time. 
   That is what I want. Just give the Congress its will to get rid of this cancer on the body politic. We can't get that done. 
   You can't get anything for the Patients' Bill of Rights. You can't get anything for the ultimate solution to Social Security. You can't get anything done about anything, but they come up with a nonproblem that everybody, corporate America and everybody else, says, look, we have been moving on. We have cut off our suppliers and everything else of that kind. Then you come to the floor with the overreach. 
   Well, last year we protected the consumers, and yesterday afternoon we said no protection for the consumers. They said they won't get a lawyer. I can guarantee you, they won't get a good lawyer. A lawyer who is really working for a living would say: Wait a minute, businessman. You come in here, you have to wait. You came in too quick. You have to wait 90 days before you really come in and get anything done. 
   In the meantime, they have been given notice so they are hiding all the records. They learned something from Rosemary Woods and President Nixon, I can tell you that. So the records are not around. They have cleaned up their records. So they know. 
   Otherwise, having waited that time, then you have to file; then you have to get in line. You are waiting another year. Who is the lawyer who is going to carry those expenses? He has other work to do. 
   So they are not going to be bringing any cases. You are not going to be able to get a lawyer with this bill. That is what is going to prevent you from getting a lawyer, because there is no economic damage. The economic damage, the real loss is not the $10,000 for the computer. It is the million-dollar loss  of customers and goodwill and the ability to serve and the loss of advertising revenues and everything else going down. 
   My friend from Oregon says: Well, we give you what the contract says; this bill will give you what the contract says. 
   Sure, it gives what the contract says. That is an oxymoron. We know it gives you what the contract says. But the contract doesn't contract for economic loss. We are talking about misrepresentation, wrongful acts, fraudulent representation, tort--not contract. So don't give me this stuff about the contract, and we are giving you exactly what the contract says. 
   That is our complaint. We want what States all over the Nation, all 50 States, give you right now, and we do not want to repeal that. 
   When we don't repeal it, then they come in in the next 180 days, the next 6 months, and they go to work and they start getting something done, because they realize this bill has either been killed in the Congress or vetoed by the President. They have to get right with the market world or get out of the way. That is the way free enterprise works. It is a wonderful thing. We all talk about it. 
   By the way, don't give me this thing about the computer world created all of this productivity. Sure, it increases productivity. But what really created this economy--we are not going to stand here and listen time and time again--is the 1993 economic plan. Don't give the award to Bill Gates; give it to Bob Rubin. 
   We were there. We had to struggle to get the votes. We had to bring in the Vice President to get the vote. They were saying over at the White House and at the Economic Council: Let us have a stimulus; we have to have a stimulus. Rubin says: No, pay the bill. 
   What did we do? We paid the bill. We started paying off the bill. With what? Increased taxes. With increased taxes on what? Social Security. 
   I voted for it. The Senator from Texas said: You voted for increased taxes on Social Security. They will hunt you down in the streets and shoot you like dogs. That is what he said. 
   The other Senator, Mr. Packwood, said: I will give you my house, the chairman of the Finance Committee, if this thing works. 
   KASICH, who is running for President, I am trying to find JOHN. I don't know whether he is running as a Democrat or Republican, because he said: If this plan works, I will change parties and become a Democrat. 
   We have the record. They are trying to subterfuge this as this computerization is moving overseas and asking for what? They want all the special laws. They want capital gains. They are making too much money. So they have the onslaught: Wait, estate taxes, we ought not to die and be taxed at the same time. So we have to change the formula for estate taxes. No, excuse me, immigrants. Don't pay Americans, just bring them all in. Let's have an exemption from the immigration laws. Let's have an exemption from the State tort laws. Let's do everything. Let's upset the world for the idle rich. 
   Come on, 22,000 millionaires for Bill Gates. I employ, by gosh, instead, 200,000 textile workers at the mill. I would much rather have that crowd. Fine for the IQ group, but I am talking about working Americans, middle America, the backbone of our democratic society. 
   So what we have here is an onslaught for the computer world, for capital gains, immigration laws, estate taxes, Y2K exemptions, any and every thing. They have money. They have contributions. We would like to get their contributions. So Democrats and Republicans are falling all over each other trying to show what goody-goody boys we are. We will change the State laws. We will take the rights away from consumers and injured parties. We will destroy small businesses that bought a computer. They won't even be able to get a lawyer with all of this stringout of how to bring a case and everything else of that kind. 
   Saying, don't worry about it, it is only for 3 years, 3 years it will be gone--if there is a crisis on January 1, it shouldn't exist for over a year. Everybody will know within a year whether they are Y2K compliant and be able to file. But no, they want to use this for further argument, and I gainsay the way they are shoving it now, not agreeing to economic damages in the Kerry amendment, turning down the Leahy amendment for consumers rights. I am afraid what I said was a footprint for the Chamber of Commerce, but rather I think they really are on a forced drive for a veto because they can use that. Who vetoed productivity, the great industry that brought all of this productivity to America? Who vetoed it? 
   I can see Vice President GORE trying to get up an answer to that one. That is going to be very interesting. 
   Senator HATCH led the way with his bill last year, and we got together and started confronting this particular problem. As I speak--and I am ready to yield now to my distinguished colleague from North Carolina--they have not 90 days, but we are giving them twice that amount. Put everybody on notice, this thing they tell me is on C-SPAN so everybody ought to know to get Y2K compliant, try it out, test your set. If it is not, go down and, by gosh, get it fixed now. Don't run to the courthouse. Run to the computer salesman who sold you the thing, because they--Dell, Intel, Yahoo, all the rest of them--are coming in and saying that everything is Y2K compliant. We can't wait around for Congress to change all the tort laws. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I am intrigued by the Senator's comments with respect to the industry itself. This Senator does not know of a lousy computer manufacturer. It is the most competitive industry in the world. You have to have the most brilliant talent around you. As they say, it changes every other year. Or every year, and so forth, it is outdated. So, that being the case, there are no real laggards or hangers-on. 
   Right to the point, does the Senator realize, for example, that they have to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission what we call a 10-Q report; namely, of the Y2K problem? Do they know of the problem? What is the potential risk under the problem? What is to be done in order to correct that particular problem, and otherwise? What is the cost to the company? The stockholders want to know this information. 
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires it. Just looking at the Boeing Company Y2K report under their 10-Q report: ``The State of Readiness. The company recognized the challenge early, and major business units started work in 1993.'' 
   Did the Senator realize that?

Well, going further, does the Senator realize, for example--we are going to have lunch with the distinguished leader, Mr. Dell of Dell Computer--as of December 14 of last year, in their 10-Q report they state: ``All products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K-certified. Upgrade utilities have been provided for earlier hardware products''?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Does the distinguished Senator realize ``no material''--no material cost? So they are not looking for a bill. 
   I hope we do not pass a bill. Then, when the world ends, as some of the Senators around here are saying, and the computer industry is ruined, Dell will be the only one left. I will be all for them. That is really the history of all of them. I have Yahoo. I have all the rest of them here listed. 
   But I think that is the point the distinguished Senator from California is making, who would know better than any, that this is a most responsible industry. They are not trying to get rid of the old models. 
   This particular legislation, the Senator's amendment makes sure they do not get rid of the old models. It is like a car company saying: We are going to bring out a new model come January 1, so all the old models that we sell all this year are going to have all kinds of gimmicks or glitches. But let's make them 90 days or let's let them get a letter back or something else of that  kind. If the automobile industry came to Washington and asked for that, we would laugh them out of court.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. He bought an upgrade just the year before, guaranteed for at least 10 years, for $13,000. In order to fix it, the charge was $25,000. That is the testimony before a committee of the Congress. He had really not only written a letter and everything else, no response, he finally got a lawyer, but even that did not work. The lawyer was clever enough to put it on the Internet and, bam, there were 20,000 similarly situated. Wonderful Internet. Immediately the company said: We will not only fix it, we will pay the lawyers' fees and everything. That is all he wanted. He wanted a fix. Otherwise, he was out of business. 
   People don't rush to the courthouse. They have to do business. If I filed a claim for Senator BOXER this afternoon in the courts of California or South Carolina, I would be lucky to get into the courthouse before the year 2000. I mean, the dockets are backed up that way. We live in the real world. 
   We are not looking for lawsuits. We are looking for results.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I hold in my hand an Institutional Investor. This is the real official document, the investment industry. They had a survey of the Congressional Financial Officers Forum of all the large corporations in the country. To the question, Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are prepared to make the year 2000 transition without problems, do you realize that 88.1 percent said yes, and only 6 percent said no? So that is 6 percent that have another 6 months to take care of it. With respect to actually getting and working out with their suppliers, do you realize that 95.2 percent said they have worked with their suppliers and are ironing out all the problems? 
   It really verifies exactly the astute nature of the computer industry, as described by the Senator from California. You are right on target, and it hasn't been said on the floor as you are saying it, with authority, too. I commend the Senator.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished leader is manifestly correct. 
   I was told, let's not even have a cloture vote, because looking at this measure, there could be three more cloture votes. And viscerally, not next Tuesday, I hope we do not vote until Tuesday 2001, the way I feel about it. But I entered public service to get some things done. You win some; you lose some. You have to go along. 
   This is embarrassing to the body. Here we are, the Senate, talking about all the important things to get done and everything else of that kind. So we yield. We talk Senators into not offering their amendments. We finally get time agreements on all of the amendments on this side so no one has been in a proliferation or stretchout or extended debate. We were even forced to vote early last night to make sure we cleared the way to finish this afternoon. 
   All we have is Senator SESSIONS' amendment and Senator GREGG's amendment, two amendments that could be disposed of in the next hour. In fact, the manager and our chairman, Senator MCCAIN, has been yielding back his time and ready to vote. So it could be less than an hour. By 2:30 this afternoon, we could be finished with the bill. 
   My question is, why do we want to wait and palaver and waste time and not go on to some of these important measures this afternoon? We are here and we are ready to go. 
   I thank the minority leader and the whip for their particular comments, because we have been riding all the Senators pretty hard to limit the amendments and to have time agreements. Let's get moving. Senator MCCAIN wanted to move the bill. We said so. I know the Republican screen all week long said they are going to finish this afternoon. I can't understand the change of pace now, to do nothing but talk to each other all afternoon. What a distressing situation this is, and no votes tomorrow and on Monday and just wait until Tuesday. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand the Senator from Washington, he has not propounded the request. Listening to the request, this Senator is perfectly willing to go along with every element of it, save and excepting right after the disposition of the Sessions and Gregg amendments, we then vote on final passage. 
   I don't understand the delay, because those two amendments can easily be handled within the hour. So we can vote early this afternoon and go on with the business of the Senate. We have very important work to do. Yes, I was the one who held it up, but it didn't hold up any consideration of other things, I can tell you that. They immediately kept filing cloture, as they will to other measures. I don't feel badly about that, because it wasn't really a holdup. 
   When they finally persuaded me they had the votes and they were going to really move with this thing, then I got into a movement disposition and persuaded our colleagues on this side of the aisle to limit their amendments, to give time agreements. Now we are ready to go, and here at the last minute, for no good reason at all, other than the bemusement of the distinguished Senator from Washington, he won't agree to vote when we get through with all amendments, which will be the Sessions and the Gregg amendments. Once they are disposed of, let's go right ahead to final passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank and join in with the comments made by our distinguished leader, Senator BYRD from West Virginia. 
   No one knows the history and appreciates the history of the Senate better than Senator BYRD and the compliment thereof. He reminded me, when he talked about the fatal crash that Senator STEVENS was involved in, I had just traveled with Senator STEVENS and his first wife, Annie. We were in Cairo, Egypt, out on the Nile to a conference with Anwar Sadat. We stopped in Madrid. I will never forget it. My wife and Annie took a quick trip, as we were being briefed. There was the purchase of a cut-glass bowl, and Annie Stevens had that in her lap, and that plane went head over heels. It broke Senator STEVENS' arm, and it cost her life, but there was not a crack in the bowl. 
   I can tell you from the early days when I first got up here in 1966 that I used to hold the hearings for Senator Bob Bartlett up there in Seattle with Dixie Lee Ray and John Lindberg and all on oceanography and what have you, and then go up to Alaska to Point Barrow. 
   There is no closer friend in the Senate to me than TED STEVENS of Alaska. I am his admirer. I like his fights. Senator BYRD was more tactful about describing it, but I am telling you right now, when he gets worked up, get out of the way right now, because he is going to get it done one way or the other, and he is not yielding. He has that conviction of conscience that really guides all of us in our service up here. 
   Over the many years, we visited, we traveled, we worked together, and we have been identified both on the Appropriations Committee and on the Commerce Space Science Transportation Committee. Senator STEVENS long since could have been chairman of that Commerce Space Science Transportation Committee, but he elected to take over at the appropriations level. As a result, Alaska is well served. I can tell you that. It is filled up. 
   They used to say about my backyard with Mendel Rivers that if he got one more facility, Charleston, SC, was going to sink below the sea. I think second in line for that kind of result would be Alaska as a result of the diligence for the local folks. 
   I will never forget; we traveled up to Point Barrow. The Natives had erected a cross and a statue to Annie Stevens who was lost in that wreck. 
   I want to emphasize that more than anything else--of course, his wonderful wife, Catherine, and his daughter, Lily--that he might make 12,000 votes, but he will miss votes, I can tell you, to be there with Lily. In fact, we had planned during the August break to take another survey trip, and he said: Oh no. Lily goes to Stanford then. We have to put it off until later. 
   You have to admire that about an individual, as busy as we get and as wound up as we get with the important affairs of state, to never forget the personal responsibilities, and the love and that TED has for his family, and, of course, for each of us in the Senate. He is most respectful. He works both sides of the aisle. As a result of that, he is most effective. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield? 
   I want to credit Senator DURBIN for educating this Senator. These fellows have to come over from the House and tell Senators how to act. I never heard ``gentlelady,'' but now I like it. 
   If the distinguished gentlelady will yield, I have been here since, of course, the beginning of the debate. It has been what they call predatory legalistic, predatory legal practices, lawsuits, racing to the courthouse, running to the courthouse, picking out someone down the line with deep pockets. 
   The distinguished Senator, as I understand it, is only asking for a fix. The amendment is not asking to race to the courthouse, but to race away from the courthouse.

We have to change the laws for them. All we want to do is get the computer fixed, but now they even oppose that. 
   Is that the case? Isn't that the amendment, really--to get it fixed? It has nothing to do with bringing a legal proceeding or economic loss or any of that?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from California is manifestly correct. We all live in a real world, and then what really happens, as we learned from Rosemary Woods, if you want to get rid of evidence, if you want to lay the blame--I am the lawyer for the computer company, and when I am notified about this particular claim and it comes across my desk, let's find out now why this thing really occurred, and if we can put it off and save the company some money on that part made in India, then we will get on to that or we will move it around here. 
   What that does is it gives them 60 days to prepare all the defenses and even engage in interrogatories and depositions, which you are not allowed to do because you are the one required under this bill to stand back and cool off; whereas, I can come immediately then with my interrogatories and my depositions and pretty well have the case lined up during that 3-month period. Then I will know whether it pays for the company, because I am the lawyer, and I want to stay on it as a lawyer, my game is to save the company money. I say: Look, don't worry about that; we are going to send them to India to try that case and let them keep on making motions, because it is going to cost you $30,000 to fix it. 
   They just sent a doctor in New Jersey $25,000 as a fix for a purchase he made the year before for only $13,000. That is why it is silent. Everybody knows how they draw up these bills and what really occurs. The company is allowed to engage in all kinds of shenanigans--depositions, interrogatories, prepare defenses--and the poor plaintiff, the injured party, is going out of business; he is losing his customers. He tells his employees: I cannot make this monthly payment. I am not getting any money. I am closing down. 
   The employees are angry. What the Senator from California has in her bill is just perfect: a fix. That is all we want. Out with the lawyers, in with the fix. That is the Boxer amendment. The way the bill reads, the Senator has it analyzed correctly.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The last thing a computer purchaser, a user wants to get involved with is law. That is the last thing. That is what they are saying in the bill. The intent of the McCain measure provides you do not get into racing to the courthouse. 
   The answer to the Senator's question is, that is exactly what is required; namely, I am a computer purchaser and user and it goes on the blink. I am trying to get in touch with them, and they know the laws. I never heard of the law. They will not hear of it, whatever it is. I have written a letter, and I keep calling, and like the doctor from New Jersey who testified before the Commerce Committee said, he called at 2 weeks, 3 weeks and nothing happened. They like that, because the computer operator and purchaser do not know anything about these special laws and provisions of the McCain measure. 
   What happens is, it puts them into a bunch of legal loopholes. It actually engages a consumer in a bunch of laws that are unique only to him, and he never has heard of and he is going to have to learn the hard way about putting a letter in, certain days to cool off, then do this, and all these other measures. 
   Heaven's above, it is so clearly brought out in Senator BOXER's amendment that all we want to do is get the blooming thing fixed and get away. Out with the lawyers and in with the fix. That is what the Senator is saying, but they do not even accept it.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I just was trying my best to give colleagues a summary of State action on Y2K problems. This is pretty well up to date. Seven States have passed Y2K government immunity legislation; that is, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, Virginia, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Twelve States have killed Y2K government immunity problems: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia. One State has passed the Y2K business immunity bill; that is Texas. Whereas 10 States have killed Y2K business immunity bills: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Washington. Two States have killed the bankers immunity bill, originally the year 2000 computer problem: Arizona and Indiana. Two States have killed the Computer Vendors Immunity Bill; that is California and Georgia. One State has killed the bill to limit class action suits; that is Illinois, the distinguished Presiding Officer's State. And 38 States have miscellaneous pending Y2K bills at this time. 
   I think the distinguished Senator from California wanted to point out an interesting provision in the State of Arizona.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. This is astounding, because in getting this information up and looking at the glossary of State action, we all say: After all, don't you remember in 1994, the Contract with America, we got the tenth amendment, the best government is that government closest to the people, let us respect the States on down the line. They had all these particular provisions. Here comes an assault with respect to actually killing all the State action and everything else, when they probably had a more deliberate debate than we have had at the local level, and they have all acted. 
   Here you put in a provision which responds, generally speaking, to the action taken by all the States, and yet they say, no, we know better than the States now and that we are not going to have a fix. 
   It is astounding to this particular Senator the course this bill has taken. Here I am trying to get a vote. I know my distinguished chairman, Senator MCCAIN, worked like a dog here in the  well. He said: I want to make sure we get rid of this thing, and I am working on Senator SESSIONS and Senator GREGG to get these amendments up and have them considered so we can dispose of the bill. So I know he is not the holdup. 
   The press listens, and they are sending the word down to me that they have a computer software conference or something at the beginning of the week, and they would like to have this as sort of part of the computer software program. You cannot even intelligently debate the thing. It has gotten to be on message so that you have to have the message at the right time. 
   This is disgraceful conduct on the part of the Senate, if that is the case. I like to cooperate. I went right over to my distinguished friend from Alaska and I said, look, I am trying to get a vote, but I know they are headed to the Paris airshow. If your plane is leaving or whatever it is, I understand. I will yield and let's go ahead then and we will have a Tuesday vote. I was trying to find a reason, a good logical reason. It was logical to me to indulge the needs of my friend from Alaska, because it is an important conference they are going to. He said, no, we don't leave until late this evening. So it wasn't that. Then I asked over here, and it isn't this. It isn't Senator MCCAIN. I keep going around trying to find out, and here we are trying to agree in order to get the bill passed and they won't agree to agree.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. When the Senator came to the floor, I said, ``Senator, Senator MCCAIN wants to get rid of it, and I do. Will you agree to 20 minutes, 10 to a side? Senator MCCAIN is ready to yield back his 10 minutes.'' 
   Now, that is the way it was at noontime today. Here now, at quarter past 3, we are running around like a dog chasing his tail trying to find out why in the world, when they are having an ice cream party all over the grounds around here, you and I are trying to get the work of the Senate done, and they can't give us a good excuse. When you say, ``All right, I will amend it,'' and you are bound to agree, so we can move on, they say, ``No, no, we don't want to agree to agree.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you learn to study these things. You look closely, and you finally realize what is happening. 
   I remember an old-time story about the poll tax days and the literacy testing of minorities in order to vote. In South Carolina, a minority came to the poll prepared to vote, and a man presented him with a Chinese newspaper. He says, ``Here, read that.'' He takes the paper and turns it around all kinds of ways, and he says, ``I reads it.'' The man asks him, ``What does it say?'' The minority says, ``It says ain't no poor minority going to vote in South Carolina today.'' 
   They know how to get the message. In turn, I can get this message. This goes right to what is really abused as  an expression, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' To Henry VI, Dick Butcher said, ``We have to kill all the lawyers.'' What they were trying to do was foster tyranny, and they knew they could not do it as long as they had lawyers available to look out for the individual and individual rights. 
   Say I am the lawyer and I have a lot of work. Generally speaking, I am a successful lawyer. And someone comes to me in January or February with a Y2K problem, and I am saying I am not handling those cases, you ought to try to see so-and-so, wherever we can find somebody, because the entire thrust is in order to really get anything done and get a result I know that I am limited. I can't take care of the poor small businessman and the lost customers. I can't take that small businessman and his employees that have had to take temporary leave because his business is down. I can't take care of the other economic damage like the lost advertising which has come about while his competition takes over. I have to tell him it is the crazy law that they passed up there in Washington. But that is how things are getting controlled whereby you just come in. 
   So I have to write a letter on your behalf, and after I write that letter, 30 days, then another 60 days is the so-called cooling-off period. Then, if nothing happens, which apparently you tried to get it fixed and nothing has happened, I have to draw pleadings and file and everything else. It all comes down to $5,000 or $10,000 for a computer. I have spent $5,000 of my time and costs, unless you are rich enough to start paying me billable hours. I spend $5,000 for much of my costs and staff and hours of work myself. The most I can do is get you back half of a computer. 
   It is a no-win situation. They have passed a law in essence not just for rushing to the courtroom or courthouse, as they talk about, but to make sure that nobody wants to handle a case of that kind because there is no way to make an honest recovery to make it partially whole. You just totally lose out. 
   They know what they are doing when they oppose the bill to get the thing fixed. 
   That is what I was thinking. 
   I know with all the State action and the moving forces behind it because I saw it last year. All you have to do is run for reelection and go from town to town and meeting to meeting all over your State. You learn your State. You learn the issues. You learn the opposition. You learn the movements afoot --or the NRA with respect to rifles. You learn about the abortion crowd. You learn about the other groups that have come in now with respect to any and every phase of lawyers. 
   It is sort of ``kill all the lawyers''--take away, holding up the lawyers for everybody to vote against. But the consumers are the ones who suffer. 
   The distinguished Senator from California ought to really be commended for finally bringing--after 3 days of debate--this into sharp focus. Lawyers, one way or the other, are not going to be handling these cases. Trial lawyers have bigger cases to handle. 
   But I can tell you here and now that consumers and small business are going to suffer tremendously. 
   Almost since I opposed the bill I have felt that it serves them right. Maybe I will prove I was right in the first instance, and maybe they will start sobering up with this intense messianic drive that they have on foot to ``kill all the lawyers.'' 
   That looks good in the polls. That is why we don't do anything about Social Security or campaign finance or budgets or deficits or Patients' Bill of Rights and the important things. But if we can get that poll--and if that poll will show something about the lawyers--then we can get a bill up here, take the time to amend it, and then when we want to cut it off and argue everybody into doing so, and then finally agree that we can all agree and get rid of it, they say no way.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, commenting with respect to the attention that the Senator from California gives to consumers, and the comments made about frivolous lawsuits, I am an expert witness on frivolous lawsuits. I can tell you categorically that the courts will take care of frivolous lawsuits quickly. You can see it. I could mention some that have been in the news with respect to the computer people very recently. 
   But the reason I say an expert witness is because I used to bring individual injury suits with respect to the citizenry around my hometown and sometimes in bus cases. I had a good friend who was a professor at the law school when I was there, and thereupon the chairman of the board of the South Carolina Electric and Gas, which operated the city bus transit system, 
   an event I said I had not been involved with, but that is wrong. 
   These corporate lawyers get really lazy. They get too used to the mahogany walls, the oriental rugs, somebody with a silver pitcher and some young lady to run in and give them a drink of water. 
   Rushing to the courtroom and trying cases is work. I remember saying to a man named Arthur Williams: I could save you at least $1 million if I were your lawyer. Later on he retained me. 
   Right to the point: The first or middle of the month of November, what I call the Christmas Club started to develop. Nobody could get on the transit bus who didn't slip on a green pea, get their arm caught on a door, or the door didn't jerk open and they fell and hurt their back. 
   This is back in the late 1950s when we were trying these cases. 
   I said we should try these cases. The claims were around $5,000 to $10,000. The settlements were half, $2,500 or $5,000. The lawyers thought they were too important to go to court to try cases. 
   Let me tell about a lawyer who was willing to try cases. His name was Judge Sirica. He wrote a book. While he was writing that book, he was being driven around Hilton Head by myself. 
   He looked at me and said: Senator, don't ever appoint a district judge to the Federal bench who hasn't been in the pitch. 
   I said: Judge, you mean trying cases? 
   He said: That is right. 
   He said when he got out of law school he flunked the bar exam three times. When he finally passed that bar exam, he didn't have any clients, he had to go to magistrate court and take what trials he could pick up. He said he got pretty good at it. He said after a few years, Hogan and Hartson asked: Will you come on board and start trying our cases? 
   It is work. Frivolous cases--they are small cases, some of them without foundation, a lot of them with foundation--but lawyers with this billable hour nonsense have gotten awfully lazy as a profession. 
   Talk about delays. When lawyers have billable hours, the opposition wants to play golf in the afternoon. We don't have to go to the judge, I will give you a continuance. 
   You agree, and the poor client is sitting there paying for the billable hours. 
   In any event, Judge Sirica said when he walked in the first day and listened to the witness, he told counsel to meet him in chambers. This is the first day of trial. When he got them back in chambers, he said: You are lying, and I'm not going to put up with this nonsense in my courtroom. He said: I could tell it from my trial experience. You are starting tomorrow morning, and you are going to bring out the truth, and you are not going to put up with these kinds of witnesses. It is not going to be just a citation and dock your pay. I will put you in jail if you all don't straighten up and start trying the cases in the proper manner. 
   He said that broke Watergate. To this practitioner, that goes right around to the so-called frivolous cases that all the politicians are running around about. It is work. You don't run to the courthouse. 
   As I pointed out earlier today, if you filed a case this 
   afternoon, you would be lucky to get a trial in that courtroom in the year 1999, I can tell you that. The civil docket is backed up that much. I don't know of any court that can actually get to trial. 
   Who uses that? Not the fellow making the motions and paying the expenses and time and the depositions and interrogatories. The corporate billable hour lawyer, he likes that. He keeps a backup. It is to his interest you don't dispose of justice too quickly. All during the year, he has money coming in. He knows he is a winner regardless of what happens to his client. 
   They are engaged in predatory practices, frivolous lawsuits, and are running to the courthouse. 
   The Senator from California is rendering a wonderful service. This is about consumers. The amendment of the Senator from California seeks to get us away from the courthouse, get us away from lawyers, get us away from law, get away from legal loopholes, hurdles, and jumps. 
   The businesses say: Just give me a fix. I have to do business, and I don't want to lose my customers, service, and reputation. So she requires a fix--all for the consumer. 
   That is what the Senate and the entire Congress has heard. 
   There is no question, looking at the results at the State level, how they have turned back all of these things, that is why they are coming to Washington after the ``turn backs.'' Look at all of the States that have debated this issue. The only State in the glossary of State action that passed a Y2K business immunities bill, the only State, is the State of Texas.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. They have not sent me any word. The press sent me word about the software alliance. 
   I know the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of our committee, that distinguished Senator, was intent on getting rid of this bill. He told me that early this morning. We got the witnesses lined up, we talked down the witnesses, we made them get the time agreements, and he had an important commitment he made to leave around 12. He tried to extend it to 12:30. 
   During that half hour he said: I got us down to two amendments. I said: All I know of is the Boxer amendment. 
   I have now talked Senator TORRICELLI into not presenting his. I hasten to add, I am glad I did not talk Senator BOXER out of her amendment, because it is the only amendment that really brings into issue the matter of consumers we are trying to defend today. 
   He said: Don't worry. He came back to me twice and said: I have it; I think I worked that out; you go right ahead. 
   I said: I don't want to vote with you not here. 
   He said: Go ahead; these commitments have been made. 
   Everybody knows Senator MCCAIN's position on the bill. We will have to have a conference when it passes. There will be a conference report. 
   I pressured Senator BOXER and told my colleagues we can vote. Several said: No; we have a lunch hour; let's vote at 2 o'clock. And then 2 o'clock became 2:30, and 2:30 became 3 o'clock, and 3 o'clock became 3:30. Now it is 10 minutes to 4. 
   I have tried to be diligent in managing the bill and moving the business of the Senate. There is nothing more I can say. I am waiting on the leadership. This is above my pay grade. 
   We can go ahead and call the roll. I am sure the distinguished staffer on the other side of the aisle is ready to  call the roll. He has worked hard. We are all ready. 
   This is above our pay grade.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman is correct, the Senator has had sufficient time now during the negotiations over the past 4 weeks to consider, after hearings before our committee, all the different ramifications and contentions by the parties. It is the intent of Members on this side of the aisle to expedite the vote on this particular measure whereby we will have only amendments that are germane to the particular issue, and that they be limited and there be no delaying conduct and action. 
   I must address immediately some of the comments made by my distinguished colleague from Arizona with respect to trial lawyers, with respect to punitive damages, the lottery, and various other things that go without contest up here in Washington because they look good on a poll. 
   If we were to poll the States' attorneys general or the Governors, they wouldn't be here at all. The State tort law has taken care of product liability, according to the American Bar Association, in a very efficient manner over the many years. In fact, we have the safest of all societies in America as a result of product liability. That is the subject at hand, of course--product liability--namely, the computerization, the software, the glitch or the Y2K problem that could occur January 1, 2000. 
   Everybody is on notice for January 1, 2000. All of these measures before the Senate--the McCain-Wyden-Dodd amendment--say January 1, if we have a glitch, we should first talk about it for 2 or 3 months. We have 6 months right now. We have had 30 years. 
   The computer industry, the software industry, has appeared before the committee. They have known about this problem for 
   the past 30 years. Ross Perot says it is easy to fix; just take the year 1972; everything conforms in the year 2000 with the year 1972, and we have a fix. 
   There are other sinister drives, motives, and intents behind this particular measure that must be surfaced at the very outset. This is not a product liability problem for the computer industry. They know and have warned everybody, and everybody is making tests. For example, the best of the best, some 2,000 leading industries, are named in March in Business Week. The market, of course, has taken care of the problem. It is a nonproblem, as far as Y2K, as far as computerization, as far as the product itself. 
   There is another problem with respect to the Chamber of Commerce, the  Business Roundtable, and that crowd coming in here and trying to diminish the rights of consumers, the protection for consumers, of all Americans. 
   March 1 in Business Week, an article tells a story about Lloyd Davis, in his Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Colby, KS, business. 
   He needs $71,000 to get his particular system Y2K-compliant. He has a problem. He can borrow up to $39,000, but he has not been able to borrow the rest of it. 
   We are not talking about an injured party in an auto collision who has a bad back and brings a frivolous suit--nobody can tell whether the back is bad or not until after the verdict--and then walks away. That has happened in America several times. But these are substantial small businesses. I am quoting now from the article:  
   Multinationals such as General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, and Deere, are making the first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for partners and vendors to prove they're bug free. A recent survey says that 69 percent of the 2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with companies that can't pass muster.  
   Mr. President, 2,000 companies of the blue chip corporations in America here are coming forward and saying--already, 2 months ago, 3 months ago--if you are not compliant by the end of this month, June at the latest, we are going to have to find another supplier. We cannot play around. We have to do business. We are going to others:  
   Cutting thousands of companies out of the supply chain might strain supply lines and could even crimp output. But most CEOs figure it will be cheaper in the long run to avoid bugs in the first place. 
   Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, and it continues to look for weak links, says Irene Deck, Vice President for Information Systems at the company. And Citibank Vice President, Ray Apte, ``cuts have already been made.''  
   Mr. President, you are talking about frivolous lawsuits. Not with all this warning, with all the record made and public hearings here in the Government itself and the Congress, with all the chances to cure all the glitches. We have had chance upon chance upon chance and effort upon effort. The most recent one here, of course, was just a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Post:  
   Banking regulators worried about the year 2000 readiness of a big ATM service company in the west have just ordered it to get in shape by June 30 or face possible contract cancellations by its 750 bank customers.  
   The point is, business is not telling business let's work it out in 90 days, like the law that they propose. Business is telling business: Blam, you either get with it, business is business, or we are going to cut you off. 
   As an old-time trial lawyer, the punitive damages they are talking about is only for willful neglect. By January 1, 6 months from now, we have this big debate, we have the best of minds, we have the best of witnesses, we have the best of software experts coming, everything else--we have the best of business leadership saying: Get with it or we are going to cut you off. If they have not gotten with it by January 1, that is willful neglect. All cases after January 1, under the record being made here in 1999 in the National Government, ought to indicate if there ever were an indication of willful neglect, willful misconduct, it would be now on Y2K. 
   No, this is not really about business because business cannot wait around. Incidentally, the claimants are not frivolous--which is a remarkable thing, how they can tie people in. The National Federation of Independent Business ought to be standing here with me in this well, because the average computer for these small businesses, I would say, is around $20,000. These are not people willy-nilly looking for a lawsuit. They are not looking for a punitive damage lottery and all of that kind of nonsense that they make fun of here and try to stir up the emotions and say we have those old trial lawyers. 
   The truth of the matter is, these small business people have to get on and do business. They have no time to get a lawyer and wait the 90 days and come back around after 90 days, then file a pleading, and then on and on. Then under their particular bill, on joint and several--I cannot tell where the parts are made, but I guarantee the majority of the parts of the computers are made outside of the United States. If I cannot get joint and several, where am I going? To India, where a lot of the parts in computerization are made? Am I going to Malaysia to bring my suit? I am a small businessman. 
   Oh, no, they have to get joint and several out of here. Why? On account of product liability, the Chamber of Commerce on account of Tom Donahue and Victor Schwartz. I have been here for 20 some years in the Federal Government proudly standing on the side of the American Bar Association, the Association of State Supreme Court Justices, the State legislators. They met and they back us up every time, because this is a problem at the local level that has long since been solved in tort law, in verdicts made there. But otherwise, long since, here, there is evidence upon evidence of businesses saying we cannot wait around for lawsuits and lawyers and punitive damages and everything else of that kind. We have to get on with it. 
   But Silicon Valley has the money. People are falling over pell-mell. I wish we could have passed campaign financing reform because we are going to talk money out here on the floor, which is when this legislation really gets any kind of impetus or attention. Everybody wants Silicon Valley contributions. I do, too. But I cannot see changing 200 years of tort law in order to get it. 
   Most advisedly, if General Motors came up here to the National Government and said: Look, we are going to put out a new model come the first of the year, and it might have some glitches. So, if we find any glitches in our 2000 year's model, what we need to do is get together with anybody who has a glitch, and let's talk to them for 2 or 3 months. I don't know what they are supposed to do with the car during that time because it will not work. 
   But that is the law they want to pass: let's talk about it for 90 days. How fanciful and nonsensical this whole move is. Thereafter, bring your lawsuit. By the way, everybody has known about this particular problem for years on end, every business magazine and everything else. But let's not have any punitive damages or willful misconduct. Let's not have any joint and several liability. 
   General Motors would say: Senator, how about changing 200 years of the State tort law for me because I am going to put out a new model? 
   You would run General Motors out of town. You would not listen to them at all. But General Motors is not up here making those kinds of contributions. Silicon valley is. Oh, boy, we can bring the records here and show just exactly what the issue is. Everybody wants to show I am a friend of technology. 
   They do not have to talk to this Senator about technology. I authored the Advanced Technology Program. I authored the Advanced Technology Business Partnership Act. I have been working with the young computerization people and technology people for 20-some years at least. So don't tell me about technology and being a friend of technology. What they are is a friend of campaign contributions. 
   So, you have the money marrying up with the manifest intent of the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business. The reason I can correlate them so easily is I had to face them last year in the campaign. Of course the Chamber of Commerce endorsed my opponent because I was such a sorry Senator. Then in February they gave me the Enterprise Award for the year 1998, since I had done such a good job. They do not have any shame. That is the bunch with the most gall I ever met to come around, take the fellow they opposed, and then give him an award for doing such an outstanding job; the very reason, such a sorry job, why they opposed him. But that is the kind of shenanigans we have going on and giving it an official recognition here. 
   Do not let me leave out the insurance companies. The insurance companies out there right now are at a hearing, Mr. President, before your subcommittee and mine: ``No fault.'' But they have a different name for it. 
   It has not worked. They have tried it in Connecticut, they have tried it in Georgia, they have tried it in Nevada, but it has not worked, and they canceled it out. We do not need a hearing.  We have the actual experience in the States. But the insurance companies, at every turn, are in here driving to change the laws here, there and yonder for money, to increase their profits. 
   I have been at the State level and have been a sort of States rights Senator. I have been defending insurance at the State level, saying it has been regulated. 
   They have come with Y2K; they have come with product liability; they have come with auto choice. They call it no fault. They want a little tidbit here and a little tidbit there. Let's federalize interstate commerce--if any business is an interstate commerce--and let's federalize the insurance industry in the United States and set the rules for all 50 States, and then they will not have to qualify it. 
   I bring these things out because they are most important, for the simple reason that the trial lawyers, for example, and punitive damages--both--do a wonderful job for America. 
   Let's go back to the leading case: the Pinto case back in 1978. There is an outstanding attorney in California named Mark Robinson. He got a verdict for $3.5 million actual damages and $125 million punitive damages. He never collected a red cent of the punitive damages. 
   When the Senator from Arizona gets up here and talks about the punitive damages lottery, the American Bar Association said less than 4 percent of all tort cases result in a punitive damage verdict, and half of those are reversed again on appeals. So we are talking about less than 2 percent. He is up here describing it as ``just roll the dice and we can get a lot of money and we have a lottery coming.'' 
   What has that punitive damage verdict done? Go over, as I have done, to the National Safety Transportation Board and you will find out that in the last 4 years--Mr. President, I want you to listen to this statistic--they have had 73,854,669 vehicle recalls. There were some last week. Chrysler was recalling some cars. Another one had something to do with the ignition; it was causing fires. Another one had something else wrong with it. We are constantly getting the recalls. Why? Not because they love safety, but because of the punitive damage lottery and the trial lawyers; they are going to get them. 
   On a cost-benefit basis, in the Pinto case, they said do not worry about it, we can kill a few, let the gas tank explode and let them die; but the cost of those deaths is not near as much as the profit we make on selling the car. 
   On cost-benefit, as a result of trial lawyers, we have had, just in the last 4 years, 73 million recalls. That has promoted tremendous safety in America, has saved thousands of lives, millions of injuries, I can tell you that. If they want to give a good Government award to anybody with respect to bringing about safety in America, find Mark Robinson in San Diego and give him the award, because I am proud of him and America is proud of him. 
   The trouble is, they are being derided and rebuked and defamed in the National Congress because we have a bunch of Congressmen and Senators who have never been in a courtroom, never tried a case, do not understand that people do not have time for frivolous lawsuits. Trial lawyers know they take on all the expenses, they take on all the time and effort for the 
   discovery, for the interrogatories, for all the motions, all the appearances, thereupon the trial and thereupon--this is what they call a lottery--get all 12 jurors by the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence, take the case on appeal and get a verdict from the Supreme Court, and then they get that fee they all talk about now in the tobacco cases. 
   The trial lawyers have done more than Koop and Kessler. I have been up here working with them on cancer. I have received national awards, I can say immodestly. I helped and worked and got a center for this particular disease, but I can tell you advisedly, after 32-some years, these trial lawyers on smoking, on lung cancer, on heart attacks, saving lives, preventing cancer deaths, have done way more than Koop and Kessler, because we used to meet out here and nobody would pay attention to Koop and nobody would pay attention to Kessler. When the trial lawyers then started bringing the cases and getting these settlements, it was not the fees that they got but, more or less, the good that they brought to our society. Let's give them the good Government award this morning. 
   I want to clear the air here because we have just run into all of this lottery stuff and spurious suits and frivolous suits. This case involves small business folks who have put $20,000 or more into a computer, and they are trying, like the doctor who appeared before the committee, their dead-level best to get some results because they are not waiting, of course, until January 1, 2000. 
   We had the testimony of Dr. Robert Courtney on February 9, 1999, before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The good doctor was from Atlantic County, NJ. I had never met him before, but he gave an outstanding recount.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   I will run right down, trying to save time. It says:  
   But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this morning. 
   As a matter of clarification, although I am a doctor, I am not here to speak on behalf of the American Medical Association. Although I am also a small businessman, I am not here to speak on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot tell you how these organizations feel about the legislation before the committee. But I can tell you how it would have affected my practice and my business. 
   I am one of the lucky ones. While a potential Y2K failure impacted my practice, the computer vendor that sold me the software system and I were able to reach an out-of-court settlement which was fair and expedient. From what my attorney, Harris Pogust, who is here with me today tells me, I doubt I would have been so lucky had this legislation been in effect. 
   In 1987, I purchased a computer system from Medical Manager, one of the leading medical systems providers in the country. I use a Medical Manager system for tracking surgery, scheduling due dates and billing. The system worked well for me for ten years until the computer finally crashed from lack of sufficient memory. 
   In 1996, I replaced my old system with a new, state of the art pentium system from Medical Manager for $13,000. This was a huge investment for a practice of my size. 
   I remember joking with the computer salesman at the time that this was a big purchase for me, and that I was counting on this system to last as long as the last one did. 
   I remember the salesman telling me that he was sure that I would get at least ten years out of it. He showed me a list of how many of the local customers had used the Medical Manager for longer than ten years.  
   The salesman pointed out the advertising brochure, and so forth.  
   But just one year later, I received a form letter from Medical Manager telling me that the system I had just purchased had a Y2K problem.  
   Here comes business. This is the practice of the business that is going on here now in June of 1999, 6 months ahead of January 1, 2000. The computer people are moving in and they are saying: Wait a minute, you have got a Y2K problem. 
   I quote again:  
   It was a problem that would make it impossible for me to schedule due dates or handle my administrative tasks--as early as 1999. 
   Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem that they had created--but for $25,000. 
   I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this table would be. The original system had cost me $15,000 when I purchased it in 1986. The upgraded system cost me $13,000 in 1996. Now, a year later, they wanted another $25,000. They knew when they sold me the $13,000 system that it would need this upgrade--but of course, they didn't tell me. 
   I wrote back to the company that I fully expected them to fix the problem for free, since I had just bought the system from them and I had been promised that it would work long into the future. 
   The company ignored my request, however, and several months later, sent me an estimate for fixing the problem--again, for over $25,000. 
   At this point, I was faced with a truly difficult dilemma. My practice depends on the use of a computer system to track my patients' due dates, surgeries and billings--but I did not have $25,000 to pay for an upgrade. Additionally, I was appalled at the thought of having to pay Medical Manager for a problem that they had created and should have anticipated. If I had to pay that $25,000, that would force me to drop many of my indigent patients that I now treat for free. 
   Since Medical Manager insisted upon charging me for the new system, and because my one-year old system was no longer dependable, I retained an attorney and sued Medical Manager to fix or replace my computer system at their cost. 
   Within two months of filing our action, Medical Manager offered to settle by providing all customers who bought a non-Y2K compliant system from them after 1990 with a free upgrade that makes their systems Y2K compliant by utilizing a software ``patch.''  
   This witness appeared before the committee attesting to the fact that what really happened is the attorney put it on the Internet. Whoopee for the Internet. And once he got his case on the Internet, some 20,000 purchasers in a similar situation started calling on the phone and filing in. Then on a cost/benefit--business is business--they knew what the law was. They knew they intentionally misled. The salesman had said: Man, this thing will last you more than 10 years, like your last system. In a year it was already on the blink. They wanted to charge $25,000--more than he paid for the first system and the upgrade combined. 
   They got a free upgrade. They paid the lawyers, too. They were tickled to death to get out of this one after it got on the Internet. 
   Let me quote:  
   This settlement gave me what I wanted from Medical Manager--the ability to use my computer system as it was meant to be used. To my great satisfaction, the legal system worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought Medical Manager's products since 1990. In fact, since I brought my claim against Medical Manager, I have received numerous telephone calls and letters from doctors across the country who had similar experiences.  
   Reading on and skipping a good part, to conclude:  
   I became a doctor, and a sole practitioner, because I love delivering babies. I give each of my patients my home phone number. I am part of their lives. This Y2K problem could have forced me to give all of that up. It is only because of my lawyer, and the court system, that I can continue to be the doctor that I have been. This bill, and others like it, would take that away from me. Please don't do that. Leave the system as it is. The court worked for me--and it will work for others.  
   It is working all over the country, and, frankly, at a very minimal cost. The consummate sum total of all products--this is product liability matters--of all product liability verdicts does not exceed the $12.1 billion that  Pennzoil received in a verdict against Texaco. When business sues business, oh, boy, as Senator Dirksen stood here at this chair and said: Then it gets into money. He said: A billion here and a billion there, and before long it runs into money. 
   This is something to protect the consumers of America. It is very much needed. They are working on it at the State level, and they have plenty of notice. They do not need a bill to say, come January 1st, give them another 90 days. We are going to give them 90 days beginning right now with the debate. And we are going to give them another 60. Happy day. We are giving them more days right now. 
   Just use the law, use your sense, do what business practices are doing all over the country. But there is no question that this thing here is just the footprint of a political exercise by those entities downtown at the Chamber, which I am embarrassed for because I used to be a champion of the Chamber of Commerce. 
   Talk about a businessman's politician, I challenge anybody to meet the record we made bringing business, and continue to bring, to the State of South Carolina. Incidentally, none of them have said anything about Y2K; none of them have said anything about product liability. 
   I remember taking another prospect the other day to Bosch. They make not only all the fuel injectors but all of the antilock brakes for Toyota and Mercedes and a 10-year contract for General Motors. Just going along down the line, I said: By the way, what do you have on product liability? 
   The fellow got insulted. He said: Product liability? He ran over and said: Look here. He showed me a serial number on every one of the antilock brakes. He said: We would know immediately what went wrong. 
   You see, substantive basic tort law brings about due care, brings about safety, brings about sound products. It is working in America. And here comes a bunch of pollster politicians and a downtown group, greedy as they are, trying to ruin small business, that is going to have a problem. 
   Here is what the Washington Post, which is usually on the other side of trial lawyers and everything else of that kind, said:  
   The Senate is considering a bill to limit litigation stemming from the Year 2000 computer problem. The current version, a compromise reached by Sens. JOHN MCCAIN and RON WYDEN, would cap punitive damages for Y2K-related lawsuits and require that they be preceded by a period during which defendants could fix the problems that otherwise would give rise to the litigation. Cutting down on frivolous lawsuits is certainly a worthy goal, and we are sympathetic to litigation reform proposals. But this bill, though better than earlier versions, still has fundamental flaws. Specifically, it removes a key incentive for companies to fix problems before the turn of the year, and it also responds to a problem whose scope is at this stage unknown. Nobody knows just how bad the Y2K problem is going to be or how many suits it will provide. Also unclear is to what extent these suits will be merely high-tech ambulance chasing or, conversely, how many will respond to serious failures by businesses to ensure their own readiness. 
   In light of all this uncertainty, it seems premature to give relief to potential defendants. The bill is partly intended to prevent resources that should be used to cure Y2K problems from being diverted to litigation, but giving companies prospective relief could end up discouraging them from fixing those same problems. The fear of significant liability is a powerful incentive for companies to make sure that their products are Y2K compliant and that they can meet the terms of the contracts they have entered. To cap damages in this one area would encourage risk taking rather than costly remedial work by companies that might or might not be vulnerable to suits. The better approach would be to wait until the implications of the problem for the legal system are better understood. Liability legislation for the Y2K problem can await the Y2K.  
   That is the message of Business Week. It was very interesting that they reached the same conclusion. I quote from that March 1 article:  
   Other industries are following suit.  
   It went on to talk about the 2000.  
   Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, General Motors and other carmakers have set Mar. 31 deadlines for vendors to become Y2K-compliant.  
   There is the Pinto case. They know what is coming down the road. They run good business. If I was on the board of General Motors, I would say right on. We are not waiting for political fixes of tort law by politicians looking for silicon contributions.  
   In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are sending a warning to laggards and shifting business to the tech-savvy. ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize the supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, Arkansas.  
   There you go. They look upon it as a wonderful business opportunity, the Y2K problem. 
   They, in essence, are saying, come on. Let's have the problem. Let's find out who is efficient, who can really supply us. Let's find out who can become compliant in time. You still have 6 more months. But politicians are coming up here, we have to get there and identify. We have to get those contributions. We have to get with the Chamber of Commerce and Victor Swartz at the NAM and that crowd and show them that we are good boys, and we are going to be on their voting charts that they will publish when I run for reelection and everything else. They have a political problem. It is not a Y2K problem. Business says, right on with the Y2K problem. We can clean up the supply chain, find out who is not really compliant and everything else early on here in 1999. We are not waiting for January 1, 2000. 
   Right to the point, this particular legislation changes 200 
   years of tried and true tort law, all for a special group that has the unmitigated gall to come in and say all this about punitive damages, lotteries, trial lawyers, frivolous lawsuits, and everything else. 
   Nothing is going to be frivolous after January. We have talked it to death already this year. They have published the business articles about it. Everybody has known about it. Every case, come January 1, ought to be punitive, I can tell you that, because they ought to know about it. 
   My particular power company group has already met and they have tested to make sure it works. My State of South Carolina was just cited, by July 1 the entire State system will be ready and going. So everybody is doing it. 
   What we see and hear at the Washington level with the McCain-Wyden amendment is, sit back, rest on your fanny, don't do anything. We are going to take care of you, because on the one hand we are going to provide a time that will put you out of business waiting the 90 days, because you are a small businessman and you have to do business. And then after the 90 days, we are going to say, by the way, the part was made in Malaysia, so you have the wrong party. 
   Now, that is the game in this particular McCain-Wyden-Dodd amendment. It should be defeated outright. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator from Colorado. This was exactly the intent when we reported this bill out by 11 to 9. Of the nine that was the main concern--that if there were a problem, we have laws to take care of these problems. We have had laws on the books for years. Business was moving. 
   What the Senator is saying here in this particular amendment is that this shouldn't preempt any greater provisions of State law, that the State law would apply. 
   I think it is an excellent amendment. I am glad to accept it.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. When the Senator says ``exactly what he is entitled to under the contract,'' when I go buy a computer from you, under my contract I am not contracting for any economic loss or loss of customers, or wasted moneys for advertising because the business has closed down, or any of the other economic losses. When the Senator says ``exactly under State contract law,'' the contract is only for the item itself. State contract law is not State tort law. I take it that is the difference. ``Exactly what he is entitled to,'' not under State tort law but under State contract law; isn't that the Senator's position? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-hollings-sc-12-19990609</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. How could they be entitled to anything, any economic losses under State contract law when it was not contracted for? You see, you just contract to buy the item. If I go into Circuit City, or whatever it is, and get the computer, I don't say: Now, wait a minute, if something goes wrong with this computer here 60 days from now or something else like that and my business is closed down for 90 days or whatever, then I want the loss of customers, the loss of good will, and all these economic losses. I am only contracting for the item. 
   So when you say ``exactly what he is entitled to under State contract law,'' it is saying in the same breath he is not entitled to any economic loss under tort law. Isn't that the case?

The current protocol will be expanded to employ real-time, state-of-the-art telemedicine training and technology to prevent, detect, and diagnose prostate cancer in our men in uniform. The program will utilize expertise of leading medical institutions such as MUSC and Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center to provide our military servicemen with treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Keller Army Community Hospital at the US Military Academy at West Point, and the Beaufort Naval Hospital.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the heroism of Officer Perrin Love, a private in the Charleston Police Department. Officer Love died a tragic death last Saturday morning, when he was accidentally shot by his partner while pursuing an armed suspect. 
   Hard-working, dedicated, and courageous, Police Officer Perrin Love was a credit to the Force and the City of Charleston. All who knew him liked and respected him, and though he was only a rookie, everyone on the Charleston Police Force believed he had a bright future as a law enforcement officer. Officer Love graduated first in his class from the Police Academy in Portland, Oregon, and had earned high marks for his performance on the Charleston Force. He earned his first stripe earlier than most new officers on the Charleston Force. 
   Public service and devotion to duty were the hallmarks of Perrin Love's life. Before becoming a police officer, he served with distinction in the United States Navy. As the Charleston Post and Courier wrote in its memorial to Officer Love: ``Officer Perrin `Ricky' Love was doing exactly what he wanted when he died Friday. He was wearing a uniform, serving the public, and enforcing laws he believed in.'' 
   Mr. President, men and women like Officer Love are a credit to their families, to their uniforms, and to this nation. Law officers like Perrin Love always give me hope for our future. These brave souls continue to patrol our cities, enforce our laws, and protect our lives and property at great risk, asking nothing in return except the privilege to wear their uniforms and the knowledge that they have the hard-won respect of their neighbors and their peers. 
   According to his fellow officers, Officer Love embodied all the qualities one wants in an officer of the law: he was brave and dedicated to serving his fellow citizens and the law, but he also loved his community and worked hard to establish good relations with everyone on his beat. His tragic death is a blow to his family, to his fellow officers, and to the City of Charleston. 
   I join all the people of Charleston in mourning his passing and expressing my most sincere condolences to his sister, Jennifer Love, and his parents, Joshua and Nancy Love. I hope the knowledge that the entire community laments the loss of such an honorable and admirable man as Officer Love will be of some small comfort to them in their time of grief.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 247, the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act. This legislation represents a first step towards providing a viable competitor to cable in the multichannel video programming marketplace. Significantly, S. 247 permits direct-to-home satellite providers to transmit local broadcast signals into local markets, and eliminates the 90 day waiting period for existing cable subscribers who wish to switch to satellite service. These critical changes in the law will substantially help satellite providers compete with their cable counterparts. 
   I also support, for the most part, the inclusion in S. 247 of the floor amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, Amendment No. 372. This amendment is identical to the text of the committee reported amendment to S. 303, the Satellite Television Act of 1999, which was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senate Report No. 106-51. With one reservation, which I will explain shortly, I am pleased that the work product of the Commerce Committee will be included in the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, S. 247, as passed by the Senate. 
   As reported by our committee, S. 303 complements S. 247 by removing additional statutory impediments that thwart the ability of direct-to-home satellite service providers to compete with cable television. S. 303 authorizes direct-to-home satellite service providers to offer their subscribers local television station broadcasts, but requires those providers to comply with the must-carry and retransmission consent rules that apply to cable television operators. In addition, S. 303 requires the Federal Communications Commission to use the Individual Location Longely-Rice Methodology to better determine who should be receiving distant network signals and who should not. Finally, the legislation requires the FCC to implement a waiver process to give consumers with unsatisfactory local television reception a timely process in which to have their concerns addressed. 
   While I support moving S. 247, as amended, out of the Senate, I must note one concern with the legislation. I oppose provisions in S. 303 that sanction the illegal behavior of direct broadcast satellite service providers. Those provisions permanently grandfathered the transmission of distant network signals to subscribers residing outside of their local station's Grade A contour, but within the Grade B contour, regardless of whether those subscribers are actually able to receive the signals of their local stations. My opposition to this approach is explained in greater detail in the minority views filed with the Committee Report. In brief, I will say that the provisions I opposed put the legislation squarely in the position of sanctioning illegal behavior. As a law and order man, that is not an approach I am willing to support. 
   Otherwise, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has been able to act so quickly on this important issue. By passing legislation so early in the 106th Congress, we have gone a long way toward ensuring greater competition in the video programming marketplace.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is nothing more than reinstituting the family hour or the family viewing period. We had it during the seventies, but we set it aside, just like the distinguished Senator from Nevada was talking about with respect to censoring and making sure these producers and broadcasters don't interfere with the creative impulses of a writer or a producer in Hollywood. But when it comes to the bottom line, they change that around. That is what we have, and it is very, very difficult to make an overwhelming case. 
   We are again facing the same stonewalling that we viewed Sunday on ``Meet the Press,'' when the representative of the Motion Picture Association, who has been doing this for 30-some years, said he did not know the effect of TV violence on children and asked for another study. We pointed out, of course, that is the way we started with Senator Pastore, back in 1969, 30 years ago, and that is when we had the Surgeon General's study. It has become worse and worse and worse over the years. 
   Again this morning, in the Washington Post, an article says: ``Movie Mogul Defends Hollywood.'' Mr. Edgar Bronfman states:  
   Violence ``is not an entertainment problem''.......  
   Mr. President, all we have to do is go to the May 3 issue of Newsweek. I ask unanimous consent to print the article, ``Loitering on the Dark Side'' in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we include by reference--not printed in the RECORD of course--the hearings of 1993, 1995, and 1997 which are relevant today. In fact, they have been exacerbated by the events we have not only seen in Colorado, but in Kentucky and Arkansas in the various schools, but more particular, it has supported our case about the industry, the broadcasters, the producers--by Hollywood. 
   Let's understand first the putoff we had and the stonewalling back in 1990 when Senator Paul Simon said: What we have to do really--let's not rush into this. 
   We have been rushing in since 1969. But in 1989 and 1990, we could not rush in, and we had to have a code of conduct. The reason they could not get it was because of the antitrust laws. So we put in an estoppel to the antitrust laws applying to this particular endeavor. We had the standards for depiction of violence and television programs issued by ABC, CBS, and NBC in 1992. 
   Mr. President, this is what the programmers themselves said:  
   However, all depictions of violence should be relevant and necessary to the development of character or to the advancement of theme or plot.  
   Going further:  
   Gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence are not acceptable.  
   Mr. President, that is word for word our amendment. What we try to bar is excessive, gratuitous violence during the family hour. It works in the United Kingdom. It works in Belgium and in Europe. It works down in Australia. It is tried and true and passes constitutional muster. 
   We had this problem develop with respect to indecency. Finally, the Congress acted and we installed in law the authority and responsibility for the Federal Communications Commission to determine the time period of family hour, which has been determined from 6 in the morning to 10 in the evening, and they barred showing of indecency on television in America. That has worked. It was taken to the courts. The lawyers immediately went to work, but the lower court decision has been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
   The Attorney General of the United States appeared at our hearing before the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and said she thought it definitely would pass constitutional muster. We also had a plethora of constitutional professors come in. The record is replete. It is not haphazard. 
   Let me quote entertainment industry executives and apologists saying just exactly what we say in our law:  
   Programs should not depict violence as glamourous--  
   I quote that from their own particular code of conduct--  
   Realistic depictions of violence should also portray the consequences of that violence to its victims and its perpetrators.  
   That was 1992. Let's find out what they did with the code of conduct. 
   In 1998, there was a study sponsored by the National Cable Television Association. This is one of the most recent authoritative documents on the entire subject. It includes not only the National Parent-Teachers Association, Virginia Markel, the American Bar Association, Michael McCann, the National Education Association, Darlene Chavez, but--listen to this--Belva Davis, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Charles B. Fitzsimmons, Producers Guild of America; Carl Gotlieb, Writers Guild of America West; Ann Marcus, Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors; Gene Reynolds, Directors Guild of America. 
   What do they say? I cannot print the entire document in the RECORD, in deference to economy in Government. I read from the findings on page 29:  
   Much of TV violence is still glamorized.  
   This was their code in 1992. There is no ``glamorized.'' Six years later, they themselves--the producers, the writers, Hollywood itself--say:  
   Much of TV violence is still glamorized. Good characters are frequently the perpetrators of violence and rarely do they show remorse. Viewers of all ages are more likely to emulate and learn from characters who are perceived as attractive. Across the 3 years of this study, nearly 40 percent of the violent incidents on television are initiated by characters who possess qualities that make them attractive.  
   Heavens above. They prove our case for the amendment. 
   Again reading from the study:  
   Another aspect of glamorization is that physical aggression on television is often condoned. For example, more than one-third of violent programs feature bad characters who are never punished. Therefore, violence that goes unpunished in the shortrun poses serious risk to children.   
   Edgar Bronfman in the morning news said this is not something with the entertainment industry. But it is producers, it is writers, it is guilds, managers in Hollywood. I know if he had been in the liquor business, he would tell him to go on out there and find out what is going on. 
   Reading further from their report:  
   Violent behavior on television is quite serious in nature. Across the 3-year study, more than half of the violent incidents feature physical aggression that would be lethal or incapacitating if it were to occur in real life. In spite of very serious forms of aggression, much of this violence is undermined by humor. At least 40 percent of the violent scenes on television include humor.  
   And on and on, from this particular report. It is really noteworthy that they prove our case. And to come up at this time saying that it does not have any effect, like they said on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, they would like to join in another study--and I understand the distinguished manager, the chairman, is going to ask for another study by the Surgeon General; and my distinguished chairman, the Senator from Arizona, he has joined in with the Senator from Connecticut to get another study. 
   Whereas the broadcasters, they know the history of broadcasting. We ought to send them all this three-volume set. I quote from page 23. Writers receive numerous plot instructions. This is back in 1953, 46 years ago. I quote:  
   It has been found that we retain audience interest best when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come.  
   That is how you make money. They can put out all the language just like we do. I guess we are emulating them because we all talk about a surplus, a surplus, a surplus, when we have a deficit. They talk again and again and again how they are against this violence, and yet they continue, under their own study, to spew it out and have a definite effect out there in Colorado. 
   Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention to Senate Commerce Committee Report on ``Children's Protection From Violent Programming Act,'' S. 363, Report No. 105-89 and the report on the ``Children's Protection From Violent Programming Act of 1995,'' S. 470, Report No. 104-117. 
   Mr. President, let me agree, though, with Mr. Bronfman on this. And I quote Mr. Bronfman from this morning's Washington Post.  
   ``It's unfortunate that the American people, who really look to their government for leadership, instead get finger-pointing and chest-pounding,'' he said.  
   I will read that again, because I agree with him. ``It's unfortunate that the American people, who really look to their government for leadership, instead get finger-pointing and chest-pounding.'' 
   There it is. We are experts at it when we call the $100 billion more we are spending this year on a deficit a surplus. When we say it is a legitimate gun dealer, and you have to have a background check, a waiting period, it has sidelined 60,000 felons. It is working. But yesterday, due to the stonewalling and influence of the NRA, we said no, you can go to a gun show and there is no background check. 
   Can you imagine the Congress that has no shame whatever? I wish I were a lawyer outside practicing. I would take that case immediately up on the 14th amendment and the equal protection clause for the gun dealers and say that is an unconstitutional provision when you do not require it at the gun shows. I would easily win that case. So we are going to set that aside or hope it is brought immediately so we will do away with that. Maybe then they will sober up and we will get enough votes. 
   Here today we are going to be faced again with the same stonewalling. They go down again and again and again, and they will say: There is no problem. We ought to have further studies.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am limited in time so I am going along:  
   Following the introduction of television in the United States, the annual white homicide rate increased by 93 percent from 1945 to 1974. In Canada during that same period, the homicide rate increased 92 percent.  
   This is really the clincher, Mr. President:  
   In South Africa, where television was not introduced until 1975, the white homicide rate decreased 7 percent between 1943 and 1974; but by 1987, 12 years after television was introduced in South Africa, the white homicide rate there had increased by 130 percent.  
   Mr. Bronfman says it has nothing to do with television. Come on. Give us a break. For those who come around now and say: We are going to have content, V-chip, and everything else, and we want everything else, we have the content, we all agree--we did not all agree. In fact, NBC, the premium television network, they didn't agree to a content-based rating system; it is voluntary. They said: I do not agree with that, and we are not going to do it. And they do not do it. But they are talking about content. 
   BET, Black Entertainment Television, another responsible network group, said: We are not going along with that. 
   But let's see what the Kaiser Family Foundation found out since they have put in now, for a couple years, the so-called content rating system. A 1999 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 79 percent of shows with moderate levels of violence do not receive the content descriptor ``V'' for violence. Of course, NBC and BET do not go along with it. 
   There is the program, ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' which appears on the USA cable channel at 8 p.m. in the Washington, DC, area. It included the stabbing of two guards on a bus, an assault on a church by escaped convicts who take people hostage and threaten to rape a nun, and an episode ending where one escapee is shot and another is beaten unconscious. But the show did not receive the content descriptor ``V'' for violence. 
   This is all in the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation study. 
   The Kaiser study also found that no programs rated TV-G receive a ``V'' rating for violence. Moreover, 81 percent of the children's programming containing violence did not even receive the ``FV'' rating for fantasy violence. 
   And then a question. Let me quote this one:  
   The bottom line is clear.  
   This is from the Kaiser report:  
   Parents cannot rely on the content descriptors as currently employed to block all shows containing violence. There is still a significant amount of moderate to high-level violence in shows without content descriptors. And with respect to children's programming, the failure to use the ``V'' descriptor and the rare use of the ``FV'' descriptor leads to the conclusion that there is no effective way for parents to block out all children's shows containing violence, V-chip or no V-chip.  
   Then finally the Kaiser Family Foundation study says:  
   Children would still be woefully unprotected from television violence because content rating V is rarely used.  
   So much for: Content, content; give it time; give it time to work; and everything else like that. They have no idea of that working. What about the V-chip? 
   If you want to really spend an afternoon and tomorrow, try to toy with this one. I have a V-chip in my hand. I hold it up. You can get them there at Circuit City for $90. 
   Who is going to spend the time to learn how to use this? Well, they are not. And 70 percent of those polled who use the rating system say they will not buy a V-chip. They are going to trust the children. 
   How are you going to go through the average home that has three sets? Can't you see that mother in the morning chasing around--she has 64 channels in Washington. It is all voluntary; it is not required. She does not know which channel is which. She has this thing. And, wait a minute, she has her 18 pages of instructions. So she chases around from the kitchen to the bedroom, down to the children's room, and she has the 64 programs, and she has her 18 pages of instructions, and it is complicated because they do not want the children to be able to work it. Well, by gosh, they have succeeded with me. I don't know how to work it. We tried yesterday afternoon when we had a little time. We are going to work on it some more. But I bet you my boots that my grandchildren will learn quicker than I. 
   I can tell you that right now. They will know how to work this blooming thing. It is not going to happen. That was another sop in the 1996 telecommunications act. Those on the House side wanted the V-chip. It was another putoff, another stonewall. We knew it was impractical. We know it is easier to trust your children than to go through this charade and this expense and race around and try to figure out all of these things. 
   When you have a dial on there, just turn that off. You don't need a chip. Just turn it off. Tell the children they cannot use it. 
   Well, you say, the children are going to do it anyway. I tell you the truth, with all these rating things, if I was a kid and found out that something was naughty and it was rated where I couldn't see it, just being a child, I would say, well, wait a minute, we are going to go to Johnny's house. My parents got me, but there is nobody home at Johnny's. We'll see this thing. 
   I mean, you really induce, excite, interest children with the rating system. It is counterproductive to begin with. But then the V-chip they talk about is just next to impossible. 
   Let us go to the constitutional question, Mr. President. It is not the least restrictive. The family hour is the least restrictive. Under the court decisions with respect to this interference on free speech, it is not that we have an overwhelming public interest established, which we have in the record, but it has to be the least restrictive. The least restrictive, of course, is that that has been tried and true, the family hour approach that we have now submitted in the amendment. 
   I hope they have enough pride to go along with what they have all voted. We voted this out in 1995, with only one dissenting vote. We voted it out in 1997, with one dissenting vote. I remember in 1995, the distinguished majority leader then, Senator Dole of Kansas, he went out there and he gave Hollywood--I hate to use the word ``hell,'' but that is what it is; that is what the newspapers said. He came back on the floor all charged up. 
   So I went to him and I said: Bob, I got the bill in. It is on the calendar. You put your name on it, if there is some interest in the authorship or whatever it is, or make any little changes you want to make. I am trying to get something done. I have been trying with John Pastore since 1969, 30 years now, to get something done, get a vote. 
   I said: Let's go ahead with it. But, no, no, the overwhelming influence of Hollywood, it stops us in our tracks. The overwhelming influence of the NRA, it stops us in our tracks. 
   I agree with Mr. Bronfman. Mr. Bronfman is right on target: It is unfortunate when the American people, who really look to their government for leadership, they don't find it, because they are bought and sold. 
   It is a tragic thing. You cannot get anything done around here. I have got a one-line amendment to the Constitution to get rid of this cancer: The Congress of the United States is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. With that one line we go back to the 1974 act. We limit spending per voter. No cash; everything on top of the table; no soft money. One line says we can go back. We passed it in a bipartisan fashion back in the 1974 act, almost 25 years ago. We were like a dog chasing its tail. 
   But if we don't get rid of that cancer, you are not going to get any Congress. This Congress, instead of responding to the needs of the people with respect to spending and paying the bill in the budget, with responding to the gun violence around here where we take legitimate dealers and say you have to have a background, but the illegitimate shows, you say, yesterday afternoon, forget about it, and where today they want to move to table an amendment  that works in England and Europe, down under, New Zealand, Australia and everything else. Why not? Because we want that support from out there with that group. 
   Of course, I think they own the magazines, the broadcasters, the Internet; they own each other. I can't keep up with the morning paper, who owns everything, but they are all owning each other. There is a tremendous, overwhelming influence for money, money, money. It is tragic, but it is true. 
   We have to sober up here and start passing some good legislation that people have been crying out for--the Parent-Teacher Association, National Education Association, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, with the 18 hearings that we have had, 300 formative studies, over 1,000 different articles. Yet they say, well, wait a minute, that is on content. Let's see with the V-chip that is coming in July. They know it is a stonewall.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The essence of the amendment is to reinstitute the family hour, and during that time have no excessive, gratuitous violence. That is all it is. We do that right now with indecency, constitutionally, at the FCC level. Just say that excessive, gratuitous violence be treated similarly. It is working in the United Kingdom, it is working Europe and it is working down in Australia. It is tried and true. They want to restore it. To those people who say they want to restore family values, here is the family hour.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to retain a little time here for the closing, but let me go right to the point with respect to the remarks of my distinguished friend from Vermont. 
   We were not part of any agreement. That was another one of those so-called stonewalls. The significant part of the agreement was the two leaders were on it, and the agencies and entities at that time were told that was all they were going to get. You learn in this town to go along with what you can get from the leadership. 
   Don't come down to the floor and say it's a leadership vote, because the leader himself has voted this particular measure out of the Commerce Committee on two occasions. He knows the need of the V-chip being in all sets, 100 percent. Wait a minute. The average person holds onto his or her television set at least, they say in the hearings, between 8, 10, 12 years--or an average of 10 years. So you have a 10-year period here. They are not going to replace all the sets. We know this with the digital television problem we have. 
   In that light, we want to make absolutely sure we do something, as my distinguished friend from North Dakota says, that is consonant, helpful, and a part of the V-chip, if it will work. We have shown how complicated it is. It is going to be a delayed good, if any at all. 
   I retain the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana is the chairman of our Subcommittee on Communications. He questions now: Is the amendment too broad? It sounds to him like a lawyer's amendment. But the distinguished Senator did vote for something identical in 1995 and in 1997, because he voted for exactly that when we reported out the ``lawyer's amendment,'' or 
   however he wants to describe it right now. I appreciated his vote at that time. I am sorry I didn't get to talk to him this morning when he came in, because I think I could have gotten him back around to where he was. So much for that. 
   My distinguished colleague from California talks about ``Schindler's List.'' Heavens above. We said, ``Excessive, gratuitous violence.'' You have ``Schindler's List.'' You have ``Civil War.'' You have ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It just couldn't apply under this amendment. So let's not raise questions like that. 
   With respect to pointing the finger at one industry, no. We pointed the finger yesterday--almost a majority, but half the Senate, almost--to the gun industry. We are trying at every angle we possibly can to do something rather than to just talk about it, because that is what we have been doing with respect to television violence. Now they come, of course, with the wonderful putoff, that ``shall the Government decide,'' and ``let the parents,'' ``power to the parents,'' and everything else like that. Heavens above. 
   I haven't seen an amendment yet to repeal the FCC authority over indecency. In fact, the decision--going up before the courts, finding it to be constitutional--by Judge Edwards, who said violence would be even again more appropriately controlled, but he ruled again on the authority of the Government, the heavy hand of Government, rather than the parent, namely the FCC, to come down and control indecency during the family hour that we have today for indecency. 
   What this boils down to is to merely extend the family hour for indecency, to violence, to television violence. We brought the Attorney General of the United States, the Justice Department, and she attested to the fact of its constitutionality as well as the outstanding force of constitutional law by professors from the various campuses. 
   Mr. President, we have had that study. It came out again by the voluntary effort of the industry itself back in 1992. We put that one in the RECORD. Then 6 years later, what does Hollywood say? 
   I repeat the various letters that we have here, Mr. President. We had the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists finding this, the Producers Guild of America finding this, the Writers Guild of America finding this, the Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors, and the Directors Guild of America--all finding this. When I say ``finding this,'' I mean that much of TV violence is still glamorized. It is trivialized. So we know what the industry does with a study and an investigation in the Brownback amendment. 
   Mr. President, if we value family values, listen to this one. 
   Out in Ohio, a 5-year-old child started a fire that killed his younger sister. The mother attributed the fact that he was fascinated with fire to the MTV show Beavis & Butt-Head, in which they often set things on fire. The show featured two teenagers on rock video burning and destroying things. The boy watched one show that had the cartoon character saying ``fire is fun.'' From that point on, the boy has been playing with fire, the mother said. It goes on to say the mother was concerned enough that she took the boy's bedroom door off the hinges so she could watch him more closely, the fire chief said. 
   Let's give the mothers of America a break. Yes, we can put in the V-chip; yes, we can do all the little gimmicks. But we know one thing is working: They don't shoot 'em up in London schools. They don't shoot 'em up in European schools. They don't shoot 'em up in Australian schools. They have a family hour with respect to television violence. It is working. 
   In this country, why doesn't the family values crowd have the family hour with respect to TV violence?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate that very much. 
   Mr. President, this is a historic moment for this Senator and the Senate in that I hearken back to 1969, 30 years ago, when the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pastore, raised the question of violence on television and the deleterious effect it had on children and their particular conduct. After much wrangling and debate, it was forestalled for what? A Surgeon General's report. Mind you me, this is 30 years ago. I say ``historic'' because the stonewalling has been going on for 30 years. 
   Mr. President, I refer to the Sunday program of ``Meet the Press'' when my distinguished friend, Mr. Jack Valenti of the Motion Pictures Association, was being interviewed by Tim Russert. 
   I refer exactly to Mr. Russert's question:  
   Do you believe that movies can create a sense of violence in people and force them to imitate or copy what they see on the screen, particularly children?  
   In response, Mr. Valenti said:  
   The answer is I don't know. This is why I've supported Senator Joe Lieberman's call for the surgeon general to do an in-depth analysis to find out the ``why'' of violence.  
   Thereupon, of course, my distinguished friend, Mr. Valenti, went into his dog and pony show of the church, the home, and the school. 
   Now, there it is, Mr. President. For 30 years, we have been trying to get a measure of this kind up, and it was reported out with only one dissenting vote from the Commerce Committee in the congressional session before last, and again with only one dissenting vote, in a bipartisan fashion, in the last Congress. 
   But we couldn't get it up because they have been very clever about their opposition, their stonewalling, their put-off. 
   Right to the point, Mr. President, we have done everything possible to show that this particular amendment would pass constitutional muster with all the hearings. There have been some 18 sets of hearings in the Commerce Committee over the 30-year period, with the support of the Parent-Teacher Association, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and different other ones,  according to this kind of action, with the industry putting in its report, with the cable television people sponsoring it, and finding the same conclusion in here just last year--and with, of all things, the put-off that we had under the leadership of Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. He said the industry ought to be able to get together. But they couldn't on account of the antitrust laws. He wanted to lapse those antitrust laws for a period of time so they could get together and form a code of conduct. 
   They issued that code of conduct. Of all things, Mr. President, they have been ever since in violation of it. 
   But I want to refer to the bill itself, and exactly what it does in the sense of having a precedent set, and the idea of TV indecency. We had indecency on TV. It was bothersome to all of the colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We passed a law that the FCC should determine indecency and call the stations' hands if they saw that being violated. Obviously, that thing was taken up immediately under the First Amendment of the Constitution and in the Supreme Court. They found it constitutional. 
   Incidentally, in the hearings that we had back a few years ago, we had none other than Attorney General Reno attest to the fact that this particular amendment that I now submit would pass constitutional muster. The amendment prohibits the distribution of violent video programming during the hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience. 
   That is tried and true. We know in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, countries in Europe, and down under in Australia, that they have had this safe harbor during a period of time, say, from 9 in the morning until 9 in the evening. I think under the indecency one, it is from 6 in the morning until 10 in the evening. But it is to be determined by the Federal Communications Commission. 
   Under that safe harbor, they are not shooting each other in the schools in Europe. They are not shooting each other in the schools in Australia. It is tried and true. It has been working. And the issue has been taken up to the highest court and found constitutional. 
   The FCC is required to define ``violent programming'' and determine the appropriate timeframe for the safe harbor. 
   The bill permits the FCC to exempt news and sports programming from the safe harbor, as well as premium and pay-per-view cable programming. 
   Incidentally, the emphasis is on gratuitous--excessive, gratuitous violence. 
   Obviously, with the Civil War series, with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' they are going to require a showing of violence for the authenticity of the film itself. That is not what we are really concerned with. Those are educational, and everyone should know about them, including children. But we are talking about gratuitous violence not being necessary, and even excessive gratuitous violence. 
   We have legislated in the matter of public interest, after hearings in all of these committees. We have the most restrictive application under the decisions of the Court with respect to the FCC making its findings. Violators of the prohibition would be fined up to $25,000 for each violation on each day on which a violation occurs. The FCC would revoke the licenses of repeat violators of this prohibition. In considering license renewals, the FCC would consider a licensee's record of compliance with the legislation. 
   Why, Mr. President, the big objection? 
   We go back. I counsel my friend, Mr. Valenti, to get the three-volume set of ``The History of Broadcasting of the United States,'' the Oxford Press. 
   I will turn to that first chapter talking about, in 1953, where we had the film ``Man Against Crime.'' I read from page 23, a quote that the writers received for this plot instruction. I think it is very, very important that everybody pay attention to this one. I quote:  
   It has been found that we retain audience interest best when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come.  
   Could there be any better evidence than their writing of their own history of broadcasting to say: Look, the issue here is money. As long as it is going to be supported and, more so, supported with violence, then more money is made. And let's get up to the Congress. 
   I sort of became amused about these term limitations. We have up here. I am in my 33rd year. We are finally getting the measure that Senator Pastore had in mind when he was put off with the Surgeon General study, which was formulated finally in 1972.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, a reading of that report will show a definite causal connection between TV violence and aggressive behavior on the part of children. Time and time again it was shown. 
   But let me go to the next put-off that we had with my good friend, Senator Paul Simon. 
   I knew they had somebody to stop me here in the early 1990s. 
   He got his measure passed. So we couldn't get our bill up for a vote. We had then a finding of standards for the ``Depiction of Violence in Television Programming'' issued by ABC, CBS, and NBC in December 1992.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. 
   I will read just one sentence, being limited in time here.  
   All depictions of violence should be relevant and necessary to the development of character or to the advancement of theme or plot.  
   Mr. President, that is exactly what we have in the law. We have the opponents agreeing to this particular amendment. Of course not. They will have Members move to table the amendment. 
   I am trying to plead for favorable consideration. All we are doing is what the industry--ABC, CBS, NBC--issued to themselves in their own code of conduct. 
   I read:  
   Gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence are not acceptable.  
   Exactly what we are saying in this amendment. 
   Again I read:  
   Programs should not depict violence as glamorous.  
   That is exactly what we found last year in the National Television Violence Study. This study is too voluminous to print in the RECORD. It is what they found in the cable TV-sponsored study with the most outstanding authorities imaginable conducting this study. Various campuses were represented, as I recall. Included were the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the National Cable Television Association, the American Psychiatric Association, Producers Guild of America, American Sociological Association, the Caucus for Producers and Writers, the American Bar Association. They say it is too glamorous.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, early on in this decade The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina was challenged and lost the fight for the admission of women to the Corps of Cadets. It was a stormy event, but on Saturday last with dignity and prestige the first woman cadet, Nancy Mace, a gold star honor student, was graduated. The commentator, Pat Buchanan, rendered the graduation address. It was a challenge not only to the graduating class, but for the Nation as well. I ask that the Buchanan address be printed now in the RECORD.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my esteemed colleague, the Senator from Delaware, on his 10,000th vote in the Senate. This is a tremendous milestone which few Senators ever reach. For our colleague to reach it at the young age of 56 is even more impressive. 
   I am proud and fortunate to count Senator BIDEN as one of my best friends. Since he came into the Senate in 1972, we have worked together, learned from each other, and swapped stories. One story I recall in particular is that Senator BIDEN used to practice ``speechifying,'' as some of our predecessors in the Senate would have said, in front of his classmates to overcome a stuttering problem. Well, Mr. President, I think we all will agree that he has overcome that problem quite nicely and has learned to excel at speechifying. 
   One of the most amazing facts of Senator BIDEN's career is that he was elected to this body at the ripe old age of 29. His 27 year-old sister was his campaign manager, and he saved mailing costs by having volunteers hand-deliver campaign literature to every house in the state. Of course, Senator BIDEN's campaigns are run a little more professionally now, but he has not lost touch with the people of his state. In fact, the Senator from Delaware has told me stories about virtually every town in his state, no matter how small. He is as familiar with his constituents and as concerned with their needs as any Senator I have known. 
   Of course, his devotion to his constituents has not prevented Senator BIDEN from playing a sometimes crucial role on national stage. As we all know, Mr. President, he presided over two of the most controversial Judiciary Committee hearings for Supreme Court nominees in American history: those for Judge Robert Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas. 
   Senator BIDEN was one of the foremost proponents of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Last year, he led the successful effort to expand NATO. In 1997, he led the successful effort to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. Today, the Senator from Delaware continues to take an active interest in events in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, and as Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he remains an outspoken voice on foreign policy matters. 
   Senator BIDEN has been a leader also in the fight to protect women from violence. He authored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which was signed into law in September 1994. This act, which included the landmark Violence Against Women Act, was the first comprehensive law to address gender-based crimes. The desire to prevent crime and help crime's victims has long been one of the guiding lights of our esteemed colleague's career. In 1984, he co-authored the Victims of Crime Act, which provides hundreds of millions of dollars to crime victims each year, paid for by criminals. 
   Senator BIDEN was the lead sponsor of the Juvenile Justice Prevention Act of 1974 and the Juvenile Justice Prevention Amendments of 1992, which provided states with federal grants for a comprehensive approach to preventing juvenile crime and improving the juvenile justice system. And in 1996, Senator BIDEN led the floor fight to restore 1996 appropriations to fund  crime bill initiatives, most notably the Community Oriented Policing Services program to help local and state governments hire more police. 
   The Senator from Delaware has long been a leader on Women's Health issues. He sponsored the Medicare Mammography Screening Expansion Act, which became law as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1998. For five years running now, he has authored the annual National Mammography Day. And, in 1998, the President signed into law a bill co-sponsored by Senator BIDEN, which required the creation of a breast cancer postage stamp, with proceeds from the stamp's sale going to breast cancer research. 
   Like many of his colleagues, the Senator from Delaware has had to triumph over adversity to attain his many professional achievements. The hardships faced and overcome by my dear friend and colleague include the injury of his sons and the death of his beloved first wife and infant daughter in an auto accident shortly after his election to the Senate in 1972, and his own recovery from two operations for a near-fatal brain aneurysm in 1988. Despite this tragedy and adversity, Senator BIDEN has never succumbed to pessimism or forgotten his role as a public servant. He has never ceased working to serve his state and his nation. He remains optimistic about America's future and his ability, working within the Senate, to improve his state and nation. 
   The Senator from Delaware has called serving in the Senate the greatest, most privileged post-graduate education in America. I think all of us will agree, Mr. President, that he has passed this education with flying colors. There is no more devoted, hard-working member of this body than Senator BIDEN. He is known for his integrity, bipartisan collegiality, and desire to serve the public good. These qualities will always be cherished in this body, as in all walks of life. For any young Americans seeking a public figure to emulate, I can think of no better role model than the Senator from Delaware. And that, Mr. President, is the greatest compliment I can think to pay my dear friend, Senator BIDEN. For 27 years, it has been my great honor and pleasure to serve with him and to count him as a friend. It gives me great pleasure to know that before he leaves this great institution, Senator BIDEN almost certainly will receive accolades on the casting of his 20,000th vote.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join in the felicitations of our distinguished colleague from Delaware. He suffered as a young lad a handicap of stuttering. He tried to overcome that by addressing the student body. We in the Senate can well attest to the fact that he has overcome it. He has led the way in foreign policy for NATO and in judicial matters. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oceans Act of  1999, legislation that the Senate unanimously passed in November 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators STEVENS, KERRY, BREAUX, INOUYE, KENNEDY, BOXER, BIDEN, LAUTENBERG, AKAKA, MURKOWSKI, THURMOND, MURRAY, CLELAND, and WYDEN. Mr. President, plainly and simply, this bill calls for a plan of action for the twenty-first century to explore, protect, and use our oceans and coasts through the coming millennium. 
   This is not the first time we have faced the need for a national ocean policy. Three decades ago, our Nation roared into space, investing tens of billions of dollars to investigate the moon and the Sea of Tranquility. During that golden era of science, some of us also recognized the importance of exploring the seas on our own planet. In 1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act in order to define national objectives and programs with respect to the oceans. That legislation laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and coastal policy and programs and has guided their development for three decades. I was elected to the Senate just three months after the 1966 Act was enacted into law, but I am pleased that both Senators INOUYE and KENNEDY, the two cosponsors of the 1966 Act still serving in the Senate, have agreed to join me today in introducing the Oceans Act. 
   One of the central elements of the 1966 Act was establishment of a presidential commission to develop a plan for national action in the oceans and atmosphere. Dr. Julius A. Stratton, a former president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then-chairman of the Ford Foundation, led the Commission on an unprecedented, and since unrepeated, investigation of this nation's relationship with the oceans and the atmosphere. The Stratton Commission and its congressional advisors (including Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Norris Cotton) worked together in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, the Commission was established and carried out its mandate in the Democratic Administration of Lyndon Johnson and saw its findings implemented by the Republicans under President Richard Nixon. With a staff of 35 people, the commissioners hear and consulted over 1,000 people, visited every coastal area of this country, and submitted some 126 recommendations in a 1969 report to Congress entitled Our Nation and the Sea. Those recommendations led directly to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970, laid the groundwork for enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972, and established priorities for federal ocean activities that have guided this Nation for almost thirty years. 
   While the Stratton Commission performed its job with vision and integrity, the world has changed since 1966. Today, half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of our shores and more than 30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product is generated in the coastal zone. Ocean and coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are severely depleted, and wetlands and other marine habitats are threatened by pollution and human activities. In addition, the U.S. regulatory and legal framework has developed over the years with the passage of a number of statutes in addition to CZMA. These include the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, and the Oil Pollution Act. It is time to conduct a review that looks at coordination and duplication of programs and policies developed under these laws. 
   Today people who work and live on the water face a patchwork of confusing and sometimes contradictory federal and state regulations. This bill would allow us to reduce conflicts while maintaining environmental and health safeguards. One illustration of the type of situation that must be corrected is the southeast shrimp trawl fishery. Shrimpers are required under the Endangered Species Act to use panels or grates (known as turtle excluder devices or TEDs) in their nets to protect endangered sea turtles. The panels also reduce catches of small fish (bycatch), a new requirement of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Unfortunately, however, the government has approved one TED for turtle protection and another for bycatch reduction--forcing the fishermen to use two separate devices, cut two holes in their nets, and double their shrimp loss. Anyone who wonders about public interest in regulatory reform has only to talk to a McClellanville, SC shrimper. 
   The Oceans Act is vital to the continued health of the oceans and prosperity of our coasts. It is patterned after and would replace the 1966 Act. Like that Act, it is comprised of three major elements: 
   First, the bill calls for development and implementation of a coherent national ocean and coastal policy to conserve and sustainably use fisheries and other ocean and coastal resources, protect the marine environment and human safety, explore ocean frontiers, create marine technologies and economic opportunities, and preserve U.S. leadership on ocean and coastal issues. 
   Second, the bill would establish a 16-member Commission, similar to the Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal 
   activities and report within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. Commission members would be drawn from State and local governments, industry, academic and technical institutions, and public interest organizations involved in ocean and coastal activities. In developing its recommendations, the Commission would assess federal programs and funding priorities, ocean-related infrastructure requirements, conflicts among marine users, and technological opportunities. The bill authorizes appropriations of $6 million over two years to support Commission activities; last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill included $3.5 million to fund such a Commission. 
   Third, the bill would create a high-level federal interagency Council that would include the heads of the Departments of Commerce, Navy, State, Transportation, and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the National Economic Council. This Council would advise the President and serve as a forum for developing and implementing an ocean and coastal policy, provide for coordination of federal budgets and programs, and work with non-federal and international organizations. 
   By establishing an action plan for ocean and coastal activities, the Oceans Act should also contribute substantially to national goals and objectives in the areas of education and research, economic development, and public safety. With respect to education and research, our view of the oceans thirty years ago was based on a remarkably small amount of information. When Jack Kennedy was in the White House, we were just beginning to develop the capability for exploring the oceans, and the driving factor was the military need to hide our submarines from the Soviets during the Cold War. What we knew of the oceans at that time was based as much on what fishermen brought up in their nets as it was on reliable scientific investigation. 
   Nowhere is the need for U.S. leadership more evident than in the area of ocean exploration. Today, we still have explored only a tiny fraction of the sea, but with the use of new technologies what we have found is truly incredible. For example, hydrothermal vents, hot water geysers on the deep ocean floor, were discovered just 20 years ago by oceanographers trying to understand the formation of the earth's crust. Now this discovery had led to the identification of nearly 300 new types of marine animals with untold pharmaceutical and biomedical potential. In recent years, scientists from 19 nations have joined in an international partnership, headed by Admiral Watkins, to explore the history and structure of the Earth beneath the oceans basins. Their ship, the Resolution, is the world's largest scientific research vessel and can drill in water depths of up 8,200 meters. Over the past 12 years, it has recovered more than 115 miles of core samples through the world oceans. Recently ship scientists worked off the coast of South Carolina collecting new evidence of a large meteor that struck the Earth 65 million years ago, and is thought to have triggered climate change that may be linked to the disappearance of the dinosaurs. 
   Many of our marine research efforts could have profound impacts on our  economic well-being. For example, research on coastal ocean currents and other processes that affect shoreline erosion is critical to effective management of the shoreline. Oceanographers are working with federal, state, and local managers to use this new understanding in protecting beachfront property and the lives of those who reside and work in coastal communities. Development of underwater cameras and sonar, begun in the 1940s for the U.S. Navy, has led to major strides not only for military uses, but for marine archaeologists and scientists exploring unknown stretches of sea floor. Consumers have benefited from the technology now used in video cameras. Sonar has broad applications in both the military and commercial sector. 
   Finally, marine biotechnology research is thought to be one of the greatest remaining technological and industrial frontiers. Among the opportunities which it may offer are to: restore and protect marine ecosystems; monitor human health and treat disease; increase food supplies through aquaculture; enhance seafood safety and quality; provide new types and sources of industrial materials and processes; and understand biological and geochemical processes in the world ocean. 
   In addition to the economic opportunities offered by our marine research investment, traditional marine activities play an important role in our national economic outlook. Ninety-five percent of our international trade is shipped on the ocean. In 1996, commercial fishermen in the United States landed almost 10 billion pounds of fish with a value of $3.5 billion. Their fishing-related activities contributed over $42 billion to the U.S. economy. During the same period, marine anglers contributed another $20 billion. Travel and tourism also contribute over $700 billion to our economy, much of which is generated in coastal areas. With a sound national ocean and coastal policy and effective marine resource management, these numbers have nowhere to go but up. 
   With respect to public safety, it is particularly important to develop ocean and coastal priorities that reflect the changes we have seen in recent years. Before World War II, most of the U.S. shoreline was sparsely populated. There were long, wild stretches of coast, dotted with an occasional port city, fishing village, or sleepy resort. Most barrier islands had few residents or were uninhabited. After the war, people began 
   pouring in, and coastal development began a period of explosive growth. In my state of South Carolina, our beaches attract millions of visitors every year, and more and more people are choosing to move to the coast--making the coastal counties the fastest growing ones in the state. Seventeen of the twenty fastest growing states in the nation are coastal states--which compounds the situation that the most densely populated regions already border the ocean. With population growth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, schools, and sewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are to continue to live and work on the coast, we must do a better job of planning how we impact the very regions in which we all want to live. 
   There is no better example of how our ocean and coastal policies affect public safety, than to look at the effects of hurricanes. Throughout the 1920s, hurricanes killed 2,122 Americans while causing about $1.8 billion in property damages. By contrast, in the first five years of the 1990s, hurricanes killed 111 Americans, and resulted in damages of about $35 billion. While we have made notable advances in early warning and evacuation systems to protect human lives, the risk of property loss continues to escalate and coastal inhabitants are more vulnerable to major storms than they ever have been. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo came ashore in South Carolina, leaving more than $6 billion in damages. Of that total from Hugo, the federal government paid out more than $2.8 billion in disaster assistance and more than $400 million from the National Flood Insurance Program. The payments from private insurance companies were equally staggering. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck southern Florida and slammed into low lying areas of Louisiana, forever changing the lives of more than a quarter of a million people and causing an estimated $25 to $30 billion dollars in damage. Hurricanes demonstrate that the human desire to live near the ocean and along the coast comes with both a responsibility and a cost. 
   The oceans are part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our economy, and part of our future. Those who doubt the need for this legislation need only pick up a newspaper and they will be face to face with pressing ocean and coastal issues. And while our coastal waters are governed by the United States or all of us, beyond our waters progress relies primarily on international cooperation. There are no boundaries at sea, no national borders with fences and checkpoints. Deciding how to manage all these problems and use the seas is one of the most complicated tasks we can tackle. 
   Therefore, we need to be smart about ocean policy--we need the best minds to come together and take a look at what the real challenges are. It is not enough to sit back and assume the role of caretakers. We must be proactive and develop a plan for the future. 
   The United Nations declared 1998 to the be the Year of the Ocean in part to encourage governments and the pubic to pay adequate attention to the need to protect the marine environment and to ensure a healthy ocean. This is an unprecedented opportunity to follow up the Year of the Ocean activities by celebrating and enhancing what has been accomplished in understanding and managing our oceans. 
   The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the United States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly its security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for food and raw materials, its position and influence in the world community, and the quality of the environment in which its people live.'' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join Chairman MCCAIN and Senators HUTCHISON and INOUYE to introduce the Maritime Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. This legislation is critical for the continuation of a modern commercial fleet owned and operated by U.S. citizens and crewed by American seafarers. It also ensures America's economic competitiveness and national security. 
   The Maritime Administration (MARAD) reauthorization continues very important programs, and is a much broader piece of legislation than in past years. For example, it provides the funding for the Title XI Loan Guarantee Program, a truly national and international program. Title XI shipowners, their operation and their supplier base, cover almost every state in this country. Title XI has been vital in assisting our shipyards in competing internationally. U.S. shipyards are attracting foreign interests and winning orders for many vessel types. The bill also contains technical amendments to the Title XI program which will save time and money for both the Government and those applying for a loan guarantee. It also provides the funds for the operation of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York and continuing assistance to six State maritime academies. These students are the future of country and our merchant marine. 
   This bill also recognizes the importance of the merchant marine to our national security by its support for the recently-enacted Maritime Security Program (MSP), a modern commercial fleet available to provide critical support to the Department of Defense during war or national emergency. This year's reauthorization also contains provisions which aim to strengthen our U.S.-flag fleet through a much needed infusion of new tonnage by eliminating the three-year wait that a newly-registered bulk or breakbulk vessel must currently wait to carry preference cargo. This opportunity, which would end in one year or upon enactment of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, would not just improve the vessel profile of this fleet, but also add U.S. jobs&gt; Vessels allowed to enter the preference trade would be required to perform shipyard repairs and other work necessary to bring them up to U.S.-flag standards in our own U.S. shipyards. 
   Funding is also provided for two new programs, enacted by the last Congress. Under the American Fisheries Act, MARAD will determine compliance with citizenship standards for certain fishing vessels, assisting in proper management and conservation of an important natural resource of our country. The agency is also developing a uniform process for the administrative waiver of the U.S.-built requirement for participation in the Jones Act trade for certain small passenger vessels, so that specific legislation need not be sought each time such a waiver is needed. 
   Mr. President, MARAD's FY 2000 budget recognizes the importance of sealift readiness and a strong U.S.-flag fleet. It acknowledges the need for a healthy shipbuilding industry and also provides for the education of our youth. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Winston Churchill observed that the ``Balkans have produced more history than we can absorb locally.'' With that in mind, let's realize certain history necessary to judgment. 
   This was a civil war in a sovereign country. Last Spring it was escalating. The shooting of a Serb policeman on the corner and the resulting burning of Albanian homes on the block had mushroomed to three thousand KLA fighting for independence versus ten thousand Serbian troops massing on the Kosovo border. By Fall it had grown to ten thousand KLA versus forty thousand Serbs. 
   In walks Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Rambouillet, announcing to Milosevic and the Kosovars that killing would have to stop; that there be a cooling off period for three years, then one man one vote. The intent was noble--to defend human rights. The dreadful massacre at the hands of the Serbs was met with equally savage conduct by the Albanians. The agreement instrument was intentionally vague to be interpreted by the Kosovars as a vote for independence. The important thing to remember is that Serbia-Montenegro is a sovereign country. Milosevic was selected as its head by its Parliament. In this civil war there was no good side. Today in total war there is no good side. 
   Another important point is that the proposed agreement was a non-starter--Milosevic could not agree any more to relinquishing Kosovo than Lincoln could the South--a so called free election in three years was a given in an area ninety percent Albanian and ten percent Serb. 
   According to the Carter Center in Atlanta there are twenty-two wars the world around--all civil. And over half more violent than Kosovo. The United States is a world power. To continue as a world power with sufficient credibility to extend our influence for freedom and individual rights we cannot venture into every human rights conflict. The American people will not support it--as evidenced by the vote in the Congress. And living in the real world we need to husband our integrity for the world concerns of Russia and its missiles, North Korea, peace in the Middle East and the like. 
   There is no national security threat to the United States in Kosovo. We have yet to have a national debate to determine that GIs are to be sacrificed for human rights. 
   The demand that Milosevic agree or be bombed into agreement was diplomacy at its worst. The Congress, the country and most of all the military were totally unprepared to pursue this threat. More importantly, as I learned in the artillery no matter how good the aim if the recoil is going to kill the gun crew, don't fire! 
   The following is the recoil: (A) A civil war has turned into one of national defense for Milosevic. When the U.S. went to national defense upon the attack on Pearl Harbor, the first order of business was to clear the west coast of all who were thought to be the enemy or sympathetic to the enemy. Over 110,000 Nisei, sixty-four percent of whom were U.S. citizens, were forced from their homes into internment camps. When NATO attacked, Milosevic's ethnic cleansing became enemy cleansing; 700,000 in three weeks. Milosevic never would have attempted this on his own save the NATO attack on his country. We have made Milosevic popular in his country.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with our trade deficit continuing to grow and with Japanese vehicle manufacturers continuing to increase exports to the United States, I rise to remind my colleagues that competitive U.S. companies continue to be thwarted in their efforts to break down the walls of ``kereitsu'' relationships built up over decades in Japan. With Prime Minister Obuchi making his first official state visit to the United States, I thought it useful to review our economic relationship, or lack thereof.  
   As my colleagues know, the Japanese economy has been in a recession for quite some time. Unfortunately, it would appear the country has sought to export its way out of the problem and to continue to shield inefficient domestic companies from international competition. For instance, just last week the Commerce Department determined that Japanese steel imports were being dumped by margins of up to nearly 70%. Such actions are not acceptable. As the office of USTR recently said,  
   [A]s its demand for imports declines and its firms redouble their efforts to sell to healthier markets abroad, the effects of Japan's economic policies will continue to hit the United States. In 1998, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Japan reached $64.1 billion, an increase of $8.4 billion (14.2 percent) from the 1997 level. . . . U.S. merchandise exports to Japan fell to $57.9 billion, a decrease of 11.9 percent from the 1997 level. . . . Japan is more dependent on the U.S. market to absorb its exports than it has been for many years. In 1998, the United States bought about 31 percent of Japan's exports, the highest level since 1990, and close to the all-time high of 36 percent in 1986.  
   It will come as little surprise to Senators who are concerned about our steel industry and other sectors that Japan accounted for approximately one-fourth of our entire trade deficit in 1998. It is a mistake to suppose that such huge amounts of money can continue indefinitely to move one way across the exchange with reciprocal movement in the other direction blocked. In view of this situation, the USTR said in its report: ``The United States attaches top priority to opening Japan's markets to U.S. goods and services.'' I trust the President will share our government's concerns in his meeting with Prime Minister Obuchi, and will urge him to take steps to increase U.S. access to the Japanese market. 
   I also believe Japan can, and should, take additional steps to increase its defense sharing burden. Let me give one example. In the early 1990s, Congress and the Department of Defense recognized that more needed to be done to augment our strategic sealift capacity. Our experience in Desert Storm demonstrated a critical shortage of U.S.-flagged, U.S.-manned roll-on roll-off strategic sealift vessels. We therefore undertook new construction of a fleet of military ships of this type. Even with this new construction, however, there will continue to be a deficiency of lifting capacity. 
   To meet this deficiency, under the leadership of then-Senator Bill Cohen, Congress created the National Defense Features program. Under the program, U.S. companies have been invited to build vessels equipped with special military features for operation in normal commercial service but available in times of national emergency. 
   Under one proposal, a fleet of refrigerated car carriers would be built in the United States for operation in the U.S.-Japan trade. In normal commercial service, the vessels would carry vehicles to the United States and refrigerated products to Japan. In times of national emergency, the vessels would carry tanks, heavy trucks, and other military equipment, as well as substantial amounts of live ammunition. 
   Unfortunately, notwithstanding support from the Congress and the Secretary of Defense, the project has met with no interest or actual resistance in Japan. This is particularly disturbing because implementation of the project would, at no economic cost to the Government of Japan, enhance the mutual security of our two nations. Especially at a time when the Government of Japan wishes to play a greater role in advancing shared defense objectives, I am disappointed that it has not given more serious attention to this proposal. 
   I hope the Administration will continue to press the Government of Japan to take steps to reduce our trade deficit and enhance our mutual security. I also hope the Government of Japan will use the occasion of the Prime Minister's state visit to make further commitments to doing so.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. 
   Mr. President, I rise to bring to your attention an issue of great national concern. We all remember the great debate that this chamber had last year during reauthorization of the federal highway bill, TEA-21. We all negotiated to get more funds for our states because we know that more investment in our highways means better, safer, and more efficient transportation for those who rely on roads for making deliveries, going to work or school, or just doing the grocery shopping. Transportation is the lynchpin for economic development, and those states that have good, efficient transportation systems attract business development, ultimately raising standards of living. However, I think that we may have gone too far in authorizing states additional means to raise revenue for highway improvements. These means to raise revenue are not productive and hurt our system of transportation. 
   Specifically, I am concerned that states have too much flexibility to establish tolls on our Interstate highway system. For many states, the large increases in TEA-21 funding have satisfied the need to invest in infrastructure. Other states have found that they need to raise more money, and so they have raised their state fuel taxes or taken other actions to raise the needed revenue. These increases may be difficult to implement politically, because frankly most people don't support any tax increase. However, I believe that highway tolls are a non-productive and overly intrusive means of raising revenue causing more harm to commerce than can be justified. 
   Congress, mistakenly in my opinion, increased the authority of states to put tolls on their Interstate highways in TEA-21. I am introducing the Interstate Tolls Relief Act of 1999 to restrict Interstate toll authority. The debate over highway tolls goes back to the genesis of our Republic, and contributed to our movement away from the Articles of Confederation to a more uniform system of governance under the U.S. Constitution. Toll roads were the bane of commerce, in the early years of the Republic, as each state would attempt to toll the interstate traveling public to finance state public improvements. Ultimately, frustration with delay and uneven costs helped contribute to the adoption of Commerce Clause powers to help facilitate interstate and foreign trade. Those same concerns hold true today, and I think that we in Congress must take a national perspective and promote interstate commerce. 
   I think that if one were to ask the citizens of the United States about tolls, they would ultimately conclude that Interstate tolls would reduce the efficiency of our Interstate highways, increase shipping costs, and make interstate travel more expensive and less convenient. Not to mention the safety problems associated with erecting toll booths and operating them to collect revenues. 
   Now, I recognize that tolls under certain circumstances may be a good idea, and my bill does not prevent states from tolling non-Interstate highways. My bill also does not affect tolls on highways where they are already in use, and states will continue to be able to rely on existing tolls for revenues. Furthermore, my bill recognizes that when funds must be found for a major Interstate bridge or tunnel project, states may have no other option but to use tolls to finance the project. They may continue to do so under my bill. I believe this is consistent with the original intent of authority granted for Interstate tolls. What my bill does is to prevent the proliferation of Interstate tolls, and restrict tolling authority for major bridges and tunnels. 
   Mr. President, this bill is essential if we are to continue to have an Interstate Highway System that is safe and facilitates the efficient movement of Interstate commerce and personal travel. I urge the support of my colleagues.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from Massachusetts. He has summed it up. 
   I will only point out again this morning's news, the Wall Street Journal. I quote from page B4:  
   [By now] the year 2000 bug was supposed to have played havoc with corporate computer spending, with companies supposedly too worried about their mainframes to think of anything else. A cautious attitude about the issue was the theme in comments by big technology companies that released first-quarter results in the past few weeks. 
   But with one notable exception, the technology industry has so far escaped any broad year 2000 slowdown.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD an editorial from this morning's Washington Post about Y2K liability.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   ``Liability legislation for the Y2K problem can await the Y2K.'' What we are talking about is an instrument, a computer. The average cost for a small business and otherwise is $2,000. They are not going to buy a $2,000 instrument in 1999 that is not going to last past January 1. 
   It is quite obvious that it is not the poor, but it is the economically advantaged, the small businesses, and the doctors in America that use this instrument now. And all they have to do is go into Circuit City and say: Now, put it up, let me see that it works, that it is Y2K compliant. 
   Why do away with the entire law system, the 10th amendment to the Constitution, the habitual and constitutional control of torts at the State level under article 10 over the 200 years of history? Do you know why? Because they put in this amendment to amendment to amendment. When they put in the first one, even chambers of commerce objected to it. What you had in the McCain bill was still a bad bill. The McCain-Wyden bill is still a bad bill. The McCain-Wyden amendment to the McCain-Wyden amendment is still bad, as evidenced by this editorial here this morning.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Quoting from the letter:  
   In brief, S. 96 [as currently drafted] threatens the ability of the health care industry to maintain rates; severely limits the rights of small businesses, consumers and non-profit organizations like ours to recover the often excessive costs of Y2K fixes, purchases and upgrades; unfairly prejudices (or completely bars) the ability of the health care community to recover the costs associated with any personal injury or wrongful death award from the entity primarily at fault for the defect that caused the injury. S. 96 permits the manufacturers, vendors and sellers of non-compliant Y2K equipment and products to profit at the expense of their customers and leaves the health care industry (and ultimately our employer groups and patients) responsible to bear the costs of their negligence.  
   Mr. President, I could read on and on, but when different industries--the automobile industry, the grocer industry, and otherwise--come to the attention of this 36-page document to change around the 200-year experience of the enforcement of torts, the Uniform Commercial Code nationally, and do away with it and the so-called privilege it required. To come in here and cap punitive damages, describe a small business as any 50 or less--I notice in this most recent amendment, Mr. President, on page 2, a defendant is described as an unincorporated business, a partnership, corporation, association, or organization with fewer than 50 full-time employees. It used to be smaller, 25. But they are going in the wrong direction, all with this so reasonable, so bipartisan, so studied, so compromising, so interested--come on. Give me a break. 
   Look at the next sentence: ``No cap with injury specifically intended.'' Paragraph 1 does not apply if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff. So there go the class actions. Each plaintiff has got to come in and prove by clear and convincing, not by the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence, but by clear and convincing, that it is specifically intended for that particular plaintiff to be injured. 
   Mr. President, what we really have is a fixed jury. We could talk sense, but I notice in the morning paper that Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, is asking the judge down there in Arkansas to go and interview the jurors after the verdict. He ought to come to Washington where they interview the jurors before the verdict. 
   That is my problem on the floor of the Senate here this morning; I can tell you that right now. They run around this Chamber, the Chamber of Commerce is in here, the Business Roundtable, this conference board, get all those organizations going. I am tending to my business down home. And you are for tort reform. You know this Y2K liability, $1 trillion for the trial lawyers and all that. 
   Yes, I am against that. I am against a trillion dollars for the trial lawyers. Everybody says that, running for office. Sure, the idea of tort reform. 
   So they have Kosovo, they have the balanced budget, and the lockbox charade going on, and right in the middle of this they come with all the fixed votes, the jurors, before we even get to debate and show that there is a nonproblem. 
   I am getting there. I can see the Parliamentarian blinking his eyes, so I am running out of time here. We are going to have to vote. But here is the biggest fix I have ever seen. We had a difficult time trying to get the truth around to our colleagues about S. 96 here this morning, but I hope we can withhold and get some time to vote against this cloture motion so we will have time to really show what is going on. 
   We have problems in this country, but I can tell Senators, it is not the tort system. It is not how the tort system affects business. Business is going through the roof financially in New York. Everybody is making money, particularly in the computer business. Of all the people to ask for special legislation here in the Congress as well as special protections and the revision of all the tort practices, is the computer industry, the richest in the entire world. 
   I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader alluded to the fact that he had relatives that were trial lawyers. That puts me in the position of qualifying to even speak. Let me first say that I am proud to be a trial lawyer. No trial lawyer has called me or talked to me about this bill. They don't need to. They know and understand. 
   Now, what happens is, when you grow up in a small town, you get a varied experience. I am also known as a good business and corporate lawyer. I represented a grocery chain that had 125 Piggly Wiggly stores all over, and we were sued for antitrust. I won that going all the way to the Supreme Court. 
   I know about frivolous suits. I represented the local transit company, the South Carolina Electric and Gas. Every November, somehow everybody slipped down on the bus. They got their arm caught in the door. They tripped up on the floor. They were small cases, but the attorneys who preceded me handling them didn't want to try them. It is Christmastime, New Year's. 
   I backed them all up. We tried them all. We won them all. I saved that corporation millions of dollars. I am the first southern Governor to get a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's. I know about business responsibility. 
   Now, we trial lawyers have had the fortune to represent people who have been dying of asbestosis, and then we have the young ladies who had the breast implants, and then moved to the tobacco. But here now for a change it is trial lawyers. We are beginning to get credibility. We are representing small businesses, with $20,000 in their pockets or more. You don't go down and buy a computer for $20. And small business people are buying that instrument. I wish they would read Business Week. I wish they would listen to Kaiser Permanente in California, how they are absolutely opposed to this particular bill, and that it would hurt the health industry. I wish they would read the record whereby the individual doctor came from New Jersey. He said he had--I can't remember the exact name so I don't want to refer to it incorrectly--a supplier. He bought the computer in 1996, and the salesman bragged about how it was going to be Y2K compliant. It would last for over 10 years and on and on. 
   And then he found out last year that it wasn't compliant. You see, you don't have to wait until January 1. This is an important point for the Senate to understand. You don't have to wait for January 1. 
   This is all political applesauce. You don't have to wait until January 1, when you go in and buy a computer, and everybody who reads the newspaper and anybody with $20,000 in their pocket knows now the Y2K problem. 
   He asked that it be fixed, and they did not even answer when he called a couple of times. Then he wrote a letter. And after a couple of months passed, he decided that he had to get a lawyer. He was told that it would be $25,000. Now, mind you me, he only paid $16,000 for the computer, but it would be $25,000 to make it Y2K compliant. 
   So as a result, they brought the suit, and somehow it got on the Internet. The next thing you know, this particular supplier had 17,000 doctors similarly situated. And immediately the supplier said, oh, yes, we will fix it for free and even pay the lawyers' fees to get out of this thing. But that is the cost/benefit of some of these businesses. 
   We have been into this tort thing. We have the Uniform Commercial Code. We have the States. No State attorney general is running around saying we need a national approach and to do away with 200 years of history of the Constitution under the 10th 
   amendment, and tort law and all the trial codes of America. The State of Colorado has a good bill, not like this incidentally, which brings me to the real point about negotiating. 
   The crowd that says this is nonnegotiable has been running around trying to pick up votes. That is what the negotiation has been about. I just read the amendment to the amendment to the amendment. When it first started, even chambers of commerce said, this is too violating and we are not going to get away with this. They actually opposed the bill when it was first introduced. Then they got this McCain bill. Then they got the McCain-WYDEN bill. Then they got the amendment, and now we have the amendment to the amendment. It showed how objectionable it was. 
   It is tricky. They are still plying downtown. Tom Donahue has been out in the hall saying what we will go with. 
   This is a political exercise. There is not a national need for Y2K legislation, as the Washington Post just this morning said. The communities know and understand. This is certainly not a conservative newspaper. I have introduced it. ``Liability legislation for the Y2K problem can await the Y2K.'' 
   But it is a political problem, if you can identify with Silicon Valley and get their money and get their votes. They collected 14 million last night and they have to perform. The rich expect a fight, and you have to show you are fighting. You don't care about Y2K and the person buying a computer and everything else of that kind. It is taken care of; it is a nonproblem. 
   Read Business Week, March 1 issue. All the blue chip corporations of America have notified their suppliers to be compliant by the end of April, this year, 7, 8 months ahead of time. 
   So we are talking about a problem that is a nonproblem. It is certainly not a Federal problem, but it is a national political problem between the parties. 
   Yes, some on this side think they can get in bed with the Silicon Valley boys who want a capital gains tax cut. They want estate tax cuts. We have heard it. The bills are running all around. That is the crowd that is shoving them. If we can just give them a little bit, I can go out and get a fund-raiser. That is what is going on. 
   When you refer to the trial lawyers, we trial lawyers are finally getting a little credibility. We are representing good, responsible, financially solvent  clients, not an injured party who is hurt from smoking or from a breast implant or dying from asbestosis and doesn't have any money, and can hardly pay the doctor, much less the lawyer. How are they going to get into court? Like I am committing some civic offense by representing them--Mr. President, I do not get a dime unless I win. What does winning mean? Winning means drawing the pleadings and negotiating, because I know you don't make money in court. But, by gosh, you might have to go to court. 
   And then you have to get the jurors. Then they will think of other things to get up on appeal. And I have to go all the way and pay all the expenses--investigation, court expenses, and everything else. That is the contingent fee process, so the indigent poor in this America can get their day in court. It has worked for 200 years. 
   It is not the crowd where we have former Senators still indebted, having been investigated, $450 an hour, sitting down with the mahogany walls and the blooming Oriental rugs. I want a continuance. 
   I want a continuance. No trial lawyer is frivolous. He doesn't want a continuance. He has to move it along. Like Senator MCCAIN says, ``Let's move it along.'' The trial lawyers are a move-along crowd. But when they see a fixed jury, then they say, wait, lets stop, look, and listen. 
   I earlier remarked on something here. Kenneth Starr is in the morning news trying to interview the jury after the verdict. We understand, from this particular charade, that you have to interview the jury before the verdict, because we are the jury and they are running around with all of these entities. I can't do it. The Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, NFIB--they are all running around--are you for tort reform? I am for tort reform. We have had it in South Carolina. It is a good bill. It practices there. I get in all the industries, and no businessman in my backyard is complaining. I have the best of the best. Give me the blue chips. I have GE, Westinghouse, BMW, Hoffman-LaRoche. Give me the best of the best. 
   I went out to Bosch not long ago. They make the antilock brakes for Mercedes and Toyota, and they have a contract for all GM. I asked the gentleman who was briefing us, ``What about product liability on defective antilock brakes?'' He said, ``No, every one of these is numbered. We would know immediately where it went wrong.'' That is what trial lawyers have caused. They have caused the utmost care in production. You have quality care and you ought to be proud of it. That is how you get productive --not on a State tax cut or a capital gains tax cut. 
   Let the trial lawyers show you the way for quality production. We get on them when they give you a bad article. That is what we argued about here when they referred to the trial lawyers as if there is something wrong with them. I am proud that we can be able to represent people with money for a change. So I am ready to stay here and object. 
   If there were some negotiations, it would be better while we move on some other legislation. They need to get a reasonable bill that doesn't change all the tort law or joint and several and these other things they have in there, where you just sue them and they say, ``That part was made in India, so go out to New Delhi and see if you can find them''--come on. No small businessman or doctor has the wherewithal to do that. They have no recourse. They are trying to take away individual rights on a political bum's rush. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator from Texas. She is right on target. We have graduated over 2,000 agents from the finest school down there for Border Patrol agents. Two who trained there have already been killed. 
   I have visited from time to time. The matter of pay is the issue. We advertise and we solicit in the local area over the entire State--and nationally--and it is a pay problem. 
   I hope we can confront it. 
   Mr. President, I will say a word about the majority leader's rejoinder relative to this legislation. 
   He points out specifically that without litigation, we have time; it gives an avenue, gives 90 days in time, to fix the problem. 
   Mr. President, this Senator knows, rather than fixing the problem, they are trying to fix the defendants and see if, on a cost-benefit basis, they can move the problem out to India or some other supplier that is indigent or bankrupt or otherwise; that is what they do during the 90 days. 
   We do not need in law a 90-day waiting period before you can file. Nobody is filing immediately. Nobody wants to get to court. These businesspeople don't run down and get a lawyer. They do as the doctor did in his testimony before the Commerce Committee: He called and called, and he wasn't called back; then he wrote the letter; he spent $16,000 for a computer, and in a year's time he had to pay $25,000 just to be Y2K compliant. 
   We live in the real world. Why is this gimmick on all legal proceedings all of a sudden given a 90-day extension for fixing the problem? For an individual running a little corner grocery store with a computer that goes down, if they call the company and don't have the money to make it Y2K compliant, in 90 days they are out of business. They are still waiting around while they are maneuvering with their lawyers. 
   These manufacturers who are sued have lawyers on retainer sitting up on the 32nd floor wondering when they can get off to play another golf game or when they can get another continuance. They think about how to stay out of the courtroom and how to get the clock running. It is a bad provision. 
   Let me agree with the distinguished majority leader and say I agree that no bill is needed. We find out after all of the debate, here comes the Washington Post that says, wait a minute, the market is fixing it now. On January 1, if there is a real problem that the States can't handle, there are courts in all the States, and if they can't handle it, we have a national problem, fine. But don't use Y2K as an instrument to distort the tort system and get through what they haven't been able to get through for the past 20 years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Federal Maritime Commission Authorization Act of 1999, which would authorize appropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. With the recent passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 (``OSRA'') the Commission's role in overseeing the ocean transportation industry has changed dramatically and increased in importance. The Commission must have the necessary funding to ensure that Congress' intentions with OSRA are met, and that all segments of the industry are fully protected from potential abuses. 
   I am particularly pleased with the effort made by the Commission to adopt regulations to implement OSRA. OSRA, which was signed into law on October 14, 1998, and will go into effect on May 1, 1999, significantly altered the Commission's primary underlying statute--the Shipping Act of 1984. Nevertheless, the Commission was only given  until March 1, 1999, to adopt final regulations to implement the changes made to the Act. The Commission met this deadline while fully complying with all notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Commission solicited and received comment from the entire industry and, based on those comments, arrived at final rules that are fully consistent with the Congressional intent. The Commission should be applauded for accomplishing this difficult task in such a timely and responsive manner. 
   I would also note that under OSRA the Commission will continue to exercise its vital role in addressing unfair foreign trade practices under section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 and the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988. The Commission has proven time and again--most recently with the Japan port controversy and several restrictive practices in Brazil--that it can effectively address such practices and, if adequately funded, will be able to continue to do its fine job. I am a firm proponent of aggressive policies that promote fair and open trades, and I commend the FMC for their role in opening markets for our ocean carrier and ocean shipper communities. 
   The amounts authorized for the FMC take into account the fact that the Commission will soon be fully staffed with five Commissioners. The President recently nominated a fifth Commissioner and his nomination is pending before the Commerce Committee. The Commission needs full funding to bring the agency up to its full complement of members and to meet its new responsibilities under OSRA.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished chairman continues to say let's talk, let's vote, let's move along. He thinks it is a procedural question. I guess, in a way, it is when it comes to joint and several. 
   Mr. President, there is an old story told about the days when they used to block minorities from voting down in Mississippi. A gentlemen presented himself at the poll and the poll watcher showed him a Chinese newspaper. These were the days of the literacy tests in order to be able to vote. He presented him with a Chinese newspaper and he said, ``Read that.'' The poor voter takes it and turns it around different ways and says, ``I reads it.'' The poll watcher said, ``What does it say?'' The poor minority says, ``It says: Ain't no minority going to vote in Mississippi today.'' 
   Now, Mr. President, in a similar vein, when you have been in this 20 years, like Victor Schwartz down there at the NAM, when you have been in speaking panels before the manufacturers groups, when you have seen every trick of the trade that they have had to repeal the 10th amendment and take away from the States the administration of the tort system, and you know that there are the strong States righters but they are willing to do this, and when you know there is a nonproblem--I emphasize ``nonproblem" --in the sense that there have only been 44 cases brought and over half have already been disposed of--some 10 others have been settled, and only 8 or 9 are pending--and you know that here we have a contract case, not a tort case, and you have to have privity of contract under joint and several in contract cases. 
   But you know this extreme strain about punitive, about joint and several, and all of these other hurdles they put in there to discourage anybody bringing a suit, setting precedence, if you please, in the tort field, then like the poor voter that ``can read'' the Chinese newspaper, I can read S. 96. That is right. I can read the McCain-Wyden amendment. What that says is, we don't care about Y2K, but we do care about reforming torts and federalizing it and taking the richest, most capable crowd in the world and giving them all kinds of rights and defenses and privileges and take away from middle sector, the small businessman, the small doctor. 
   We put into the RECORD, Mr. President, where an individual doctor up in New Jersey--he came before the committee--bought this particular computer in 1996. He talked about the salesman who bragged in terms that it would last 10 years. Like the old adage regarding the Packard, he said, ``Ask the man who 
   owns one. Go and see these. They will last for years. This will take you into the next century.'' And then he finds, of course, that this past year it broke down. It didn't work and he could not get his surgical appointments straight, and otherwise. So he called the salesman and the company, and they absolutely refused. 
   After several weeks he writes a letter and demands, and they still refuse. A couple of months pass and he gets an attorney. When he gets the attorney, at first they don't respond. But somehow the attorney, or others, had the smarts to put it on the Internet. The next thing you know, they had 17,000 doctors who were similarly situated, and the computer company immediately settled and replaced them free. 
   When the demands were first made, they said, ``Yes, we can fix it for you for $25,000,'' when the instrument itself, the computer, only cost $13,000 in 1996. But to fix it was $25,000. He didn't, of course, have the $25,000. So all of those cases were settled to the satisfaction of both parties, the computer company, and everything else. 
   So these are not bad back cases, or some that are indeterminate with respect to injury, pain, and suffering, and a sentimental kind of case of a person  having lost his job, in that sense, and all that, where you get poor people injured in a wreck; but, on the contrary, responsible business people who operate by way of contract with the company. You see all of these tort things superimposed and you hear them in the conferences say it is nonnegotiable, there is a nonnegotiable item here, joint and several; it is nonnegotiable because under the chairman's onslaught here, it is, ``Let's move, let's vote, let's vote.'' 
   I responded to him yesterday. I am a minority of a minority. I am trying to make sense out of a bum's rush. They have all the organizations. I have been talking to the trial lawyers about this thing. I know all of them, and they have been big friends of mine, and they did respond handsomely last year in the campaign. But I have been in it 20 years. In the early eighties, in the Presidential race and everything else, I still pleaded the cause and I got no help. So I have a track record of not just taking a position to help good friends in the trial business, but I have the greatest respect for all those friends, because they are there for the injured parties. They are the ones setting the record on health. These trial lawyers have done more to save people from cancer than Koop and Kessler put together. I have been on the floor 33 years now, and we could not get anything moving on cancer and smoking. 
   Now we have it. Not only on account of dollars, not only on account of the Cancer Institute, not only on account of the American Cancer Society, all leaders that they are with concerns in this field, but on account of trial lawyers. I see them institute the Environmental Protection Agency and institute the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   When you see those cars recalled, yes. That trial lawyer, Mark Robinson, out there in San Diego, back in 1978 got a $128 million verdict. It was $3.5 million actual, but $125 million punitive. He never has collected a red cent of the $125 million punitive. But he has brought to the automobile manufacturers a conscience rather than a cost-benefit study to just write it off and let them pay and pay the lawyers, and pay the doctors, and pay for the injuries, or beat the case on a cost-benefit study. On the contrary, there was one company just last week that recalled another million cars. You see these car recalls. That is my trial lawyer friends. I am very proud of them. 
   But in this particular case I am trying to protect on the one hand that small doctor, that small businessman, or, on the other hand, what we are trying to do is protect the States and the administration of tort law. 
   They talk about the ``glitches''--the ``glitches'' and ``deep pockets'' and ``deep pockets.'' We have at this minute, as I speak, on the floor of the Senate, glitches. Everybody has a computer. It comes up again and again with a glitch. You learn how to get it fixed. Nobody is running down to the courthouse. There were only 40 more cases this past year. Deep pockets--you have people running around here. They had a gentleman come in here from America Online. I saw in the USA Today his income last year --just annual--income $325 million. He has deep pockets. But nobody is suing him. He is a wonderful, brilliant individual who deserves every dollar he makes. I am for him. That is the American way. 
   But there are deep pockets in this technology computerization industry. And there are glitches. 
   Don't give me this stuff about January 1 glitches, glitches all of a sudden, and that we have to change the whole tort system. You can go ahead and get your computer now. As Business Week shows, they are demanding that the small businessmen come about with the changes in their equipment and become Y2K compliant, or else they are going to run out of suppliers and other distributors that will be Y2K compliant. They are in business. They are not in the law game that the Chamber of Commerce is in downtown. That is their political gain--to get them, pile on, find a nonproblem, but find the organizations, go tell all of them, and say, ``Do you believe in tort?'' ``Yes. I believe in tort reform.'' ``Write your letters to the Senators and talk about $1 trillion''--outrageous estimations. There is not going to be any such thing. Everybody knows it. 
   I am happy today to receive from the White House a ``Statement of Administration Policy.'' ``This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned agencies.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   There it is, Mr. President. We are trying to mushroom a nonproblem into a crisis with $1 trillion worth of lawsuits all on the political juggernaut of the Chamber of Commerce downtown for greed, and taking away rights to protect the group that is not only protectable--God knows they have the money--but they know it. They can bring in their instrument right now and make it compliant. 
   Those who are purchasing are being told, like that doctor in New Jersey, that it is compliant. But they are being taken advantage of. You find out it is not, and it is not until they have everybody ready to go that, ``Oh, no. We are ready to give you a new computer free.'' Not $25,000, as they charged for months, but they would have to be paid before they get any results. ``We are glad to give you this free, and even to pay your attorney fees.'' Right or wrong? Is this a frivolous lawsuit, some kind of bad back, injured party case coming across trying to go after deep pockets? It is legitimate small businesses that can work right now. They will be like an automobile dealer trying to offload their old year models, with misleading purchases sometimes. But they find out that hasn't paid, so they have gotten very competitive. 
   This market this minute is very, very competitive. Read Business Week.  The market is working. But there is a political agenda here on course, not really to look out for the small businessman, but change the rights of the States under the 10th amendment to administer tort cases. Here with the administration, do you see any States coming up and saying that they are totally inadequate, that they can't handle it, that what they really need is the Federal Government to interpose and change the rules of jurisprudence? 
   Does any State come up here? Does any legitimate legal organization come up here? Not at all. 
   I heard what the distinguished Senator from Oregon read about the American Bar Association, but give us hearings before the American Bar and give us the legal folks--they understand law. That is one of the difficulties we have in the Commerce Committee. We don't necessarily have profound legal talent, so they don't want to study it. They look at a business cost-profit standpoint and then it is the bum's rush for S. 96. 
   I am glad the rush now has stopped with the policy of the administration and the recommended veto of S. 96 and the McCain-Wyden amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator has come to the Senate not just as a practitioner, but as a brilliant one, as you can tell from his comments here on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. 
   Is it not a fact that what this really does is create disincentives to produce a good Y2K-compliant product--isn't that correct? If companies know they do not have to worry about making their products competitive and reliable, they have no incentive to make a good product. In fact, removing any threat of litigation will remove any need for technology companies and businesses to ensure that their products and systems are ready to handle the Y2K problem. I have been asked by none other than Jerry Yang, the head of the Internet company Yahoo, to oppose this bill, because Mr. Yang said he will use the fact that companies do not have Y2K-compliant computers when he competes with them. 
   So, isn't it the fact that when you get this kind of obstacle course of legalities companies will say: We do not have to worry about the quality of the product or whether or not it is Y2K compliant, because by the time they can finally get to me, and everything else like that, on a cost/benefit basis it is better for me to get rid of all these old noncompliant models. I don't mind paying a few lawyers to protect me on these hurdles here. Isn't that the case?

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what ``Business Week'' just put out a month ago in its March 1 issue. The marketplace was taking care of what problems could ensue come January 1 of the year 2000. All of the blue chip corporations--grocery, manufacturers, automotive dealers--everybody is really concerned if they don't perform and have Y2K compliance, they are going to lose the business. The blue-chippers have come around and told their suppliers and distributors and everything else: Unless you become Y2K compliant, we are going to find a new sales force and distributors and otherwise to handle our product. 
   Really, that is the conclusion to which the ``Business Week'' article came. In fact, the Y2K problem is going to clean out the laggards and bring out nothing but good, quality producers. It is not going to be a problem come January 1, because the market is behaving effectively. We get extremes like this legislation because the Chamber of Commerce gets down there and starts talking about a trillion dollars' worth of lawsuits, and we see entities coming in not knowing really what is at issue. 
   The fact is, then having said that, they are way off base in the whole thing with respect to the market itself. And as the Senator indicates, the responsible producers in America, they are the best of the best because they are competing internationally with the Japanese and everything else. So we have the best producers and they will comply. They want to comply because that is good business. They don't want to get bogged down with lawyers and everything else like that. 
   But a few companies want to have the political crowd in Washington throw up an obstacle course for consumers and small businesses, so that those companies do not have to worry about making good, reliable, Y2K-compliant products.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Isn't that the case? That is why you find the extremes of tort law provision in here, and joint and several? The drive really is not to take care of the Y2K problem but to take 
   care of what they call the lawyer problem in business. It has brought about the most responsible production in the entire world. We have quality production. We have safe articles on the market. On product liability and everything else, they have been coming after us for 20 years. Now they have all joined together, of all people not to hurt, just injured individuals with bad back cases like you and I have handled, but on the contrary, little small businesses, individual doctors who have to have a computer and have to keep up with their surgery and everything else of that kind. 
   I cite that because that is the testimony we had before the Commerce Committee. An individual doctor, in 1996, bought a computer. They bragged how it was going to last for 10 years and be Y2K compliant. And instead of being Y2K compliant, it was not. He asked for it to be repaired. He went twice to do it. They told him, you might have bought it for $16,000, but it is going to cost you $25,000. He didn't have the $25,000 to make it compliant. He finally brought a lawsuit, and the computer industry on the Internet picked it up and before long he had $17,000 against this particular supplier. They came around immediately and said: We will do it for free for everybody and pay the lawyers' fees. 
   That is what we are trying to avoid. But I do congratulate the Senator on his very cogent analysis and commonsensical approach and experienced judgment that he has rendered here this afternoon on this particular issue.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will go right to the point with respect to the compromise. I have in hand a letter from Craig R. Barrett, the distinguished CEO of Intel. 
   Without reading the entire letter, the consensus is that what they would really need is a settlement or compromise regarding four particular points. One is procedural incentives; another is with respect to the provisions of contracts, that they have specificity; third, threshold pleading provisions and the amount of damages in materiality of defects which would help constrain class action suits; and, of course, the matter of proportionality, or joint and several. 
   I contacted Mr. Grove and told him we would yield on three points, but we didn't want to get into tort law with a contract provision--all triable under the Uniform Commercial Code. He didn't think he could yield on that fourth one. 
   Since that time, I understand that the downtown Chamber of Commerce says they are not yielding at all with respect to the test in tort law. 
   My colleague from Oregon says there are nine points and that we have gotten together. That is garbage. That is not the case at all, I can say that right now. 
   They are determined to change the proof of neglect by ``the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence'' to ``clear and convincing.'' I thought that was compromise. Reviewing the McCain-Wyden amendment that is now under debate, Members will find on that page scratched out and written in, ``clear and convincing evidence.'' They want to change the burden in tort cases from ``the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence'' to ``clear and convincing.'' 
   How can you do that when you do not have the elements before you? You do not have control of the manufacturer; you do not have control of the software. If you are like me and other professionals like our doctor friends or CPAs, they don't know those kinds of things. They have to do the best they can by the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence--not clear and convincing. 
   So they stick to punitive, they stick to clear and convincing, they stick to joint and several, but they come on the floor of the Senate and exclaim how reasonable they are and then allude, of course, to the trial lawyers and talk about campaign financing, but say as an aside, We don't want to get into it--as if the Senator from South Carolina is paid by trial lawyers to do this. 
   I represented corporate America, and I will list those companies. I was proud of the Electric and Gas. I was proud of the wholesale grocer, Piggly Wiggly firm. We had 121 stores. I was their chief counsel on an antitrust case which I took all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. I won. I had good corporate clients, too. I am proud of trial lawyers. We don't have time for frivolous cases. 
   This downtown crowd will never see the courtroom. They sit there in the mahogany rooms with the Persian rugs. Their colleagues call and say, Let's get a continuance, I want to play golf this afternoon--the clock runs on billable hours. The clock is running and the clients never know the difference. And they pay $450 to $500 an hour. 
   The distinguished Senator from Ohio who sat in front of me, now a national hero, is indebted to a case for billable hours. 
   We know about downtown. I don't understand aspersions with respect to the trial bar--we are looking out for the injured parties. 
   I want these matters in the RECORD. The case is clear cut, in this Senator's mind. For example, I talked for about an hour in the office with the distinguished head of Intel, Andy Grove, some weeks back. I don't want anyone to be misled, he is for proportionality. That is explained in the letter. However, he said it wasn't a real problem.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, GM and other carmakers have set a March 31 deadline for vendors to become Y2K compliant. In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are sending warnings to laggards and shifting business, so the text-savvy Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize the supply system. 
   The market is working. We pointed that out. In a report by none other than Bill Gates at the World Economic Forum, they believe the millennium bug, aside from some possible glitches in delivery and supply, may pose only modest problems. Mr. Gates talked about it not being a real problem.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. One line in the article reads,  
   Sponsoring GOP Senators say this bill would provide incentives for solving technical issues before failures occur, but in fact it does just the opposite. It eliminates the threat of lawsuits as a negative incentive for companies that might otherwise neglect their responsibilities in addressing their Y2K problems or reimbursing consumers for their losses. Federal legislation that overrides  State courts is a serious infringement on States' rights that merits only rare application, while a massive computer meltdown meets that criteria. Congress passed the tightly-crafted bipartisan bill to help companies work through the problem.  
   As you can see from the Business Week article, they worked through that problem. 
   Mr. President, there was some interesting testimony that we received before our committee a few weeks back from a Dr. Robert Courtney. It is talking about the cases. 
   Incidentally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter of yesterday from the Honorable Ronald N. Weikers.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. This letter is addressed to my staff, Mr. Moses Boyd. It says:  
   Dear Mr. Boyd: Thank you for speaking with me earlier. Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to date have been dismissed entirely or almost entirely. Twelve (12) cases have been settled for moderate sums or for no money. The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims, and Y2K legislation is therefore unnecessary. 
   Thirty-five (35) cases have been filed on behalf of corporate entities, such as health care providers, retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and more. Nine (9) cases have been filed on behalf of individuals. This trend will continue. Thus, the same corporations that are lobbying for Y2K legislation may be limiting their own rights to recover remediation costs or damages. 
   I have studied the Y2K problem carefully from the legal perspective, and have written a book entitled ``Litigating Year 2000 Cases,'' which will be published by West Group in June. I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do not represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation. Feel free to call me, should you have any questions. Thank you very much. Very truly yours, Ronald N. Weikers, Attorney at Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  
   Mr. President, there are things in here to emphasize. One is: ``I do not represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation.'' And I emphasize that his book will be published by the West Group in June. The month after next, in about 5 or 6 weeks, this book will be coming out. I can tell you as a practicing attorney that the West Group is not going to publish any partisan political book or edition. It would not sell to the lawyers on both sides. We like to look up and find the authorities, not political arguments. The West Group is in that particular field professionally of documenting in a research fashion the matter of Y2K cases in this particular interest. I can tell you right now they have pretty good evidence about what has been occurring.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, he is a doctor from Atlantic County, NJ. I will not read it in its entirety, but he said:  
   ......But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this morning. 
   ......Although I am a doctor, I am not here to speak on behalf of the [AMA]. Although I am a small businessman, I am not here to speak on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot tell you how these organizations feel........But I can tell you how it would have affected my business. 
   I am one of the lucky ones. While a potential Y2K failure impacted my practice, the computer vendor that sold me the software system and I were able to reach an out-of-court settlement which was fair and expedient. 
   ......In 1987, I purchased a computer system from Medical Manager, one of the leading medical systems providers in the country. I used the Medical Manager system for tracking surgery, scheduling due dates and billing.  
   Incidentally, that is very important for a doctor. If he gets sued for malpractice, it might be based on his computer and not on his professional treatment. 
   I go on to read:  
   ......The system worked well for me for ten years, until the computer finally crashed from lack of sufficient memory. 
   In 1996, I replaced my old system with a new, state of the art pentium system from Medical Manager for $13,000. This was a huge investment for a practice my size. 
   I remember joking with the computer salesman at the time that this was a big purchase for me, and I was counting on this system to last as long as the last one did--  
   which was over 10 years--  
   I remember the salesman telling me that he was sure that I would get at least ten years out of it. He showed me a list of how many of his local customers had used the Medical Manager for longer than ten years.  
   Jumping down:  
   ......one year later, I received a form letter from Medical Manager telling me the system I had just purchased had a Y2K problem. It was a problem that would make it impossible for me to schedule due dates or handle my administrative tasks--as early as 1999. 
   Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem that they had created--but for $25,000.  
   He only paid $13,000.  
   I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this table would be. The original system had cost me $15,000 when I purchased it in 1986. The upgraded system cost me $13,000 in 1996. Now, a year later, they wanted another $25,000. They knew when they sold me the $13,000 system that it would need this upgrade--but, of course, they didn't tell me. 
   The company ignored my request, however, and several months later, sent me an estimate for fixing the problem--again, for $25,000.  
   But he said he didn't have the $25,000.  
   ......I was appalled at the thought of having to pay Medical Manager for a problem that they had created and should have anticipated. 
   ......I had to pay that $25,000.....[so] I retained an attorney and sued Medical Manager [under the present law]. 
   ......To my great satisfaction, the legal system worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought Medical Manager's products since 1990. In fact, since I brought my claim against Medical Manager, I have received numerous telephone calls and letters from doctors across the country who had similar experiences.  
   I can go down the letter, Mr. President. The point is that he settled the case that was for some $1,455,000 for 17,000 doctors. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a note from Jack Emery of the American Medical Association.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I was compelled momentarily to object to the request of our distinguished leader that the amendments be germane. I think a word is in order to understand my objection. 
   What happens is, No. 1, we have tried our dead-level best to compromise and move this particular piece of legislation along. My Intel friends wrote us a letter to the effect that there were four demands. I contacted Mr. Grove by phone and told him that of the four, I could agree to the waiting time period, to the materiality and the specificity, but the joint and several went to the heart of tort law and trials and I could not agree to that. 
   My understanding is and I am willing to fill out the record on this, our Chamber of Commerce friend, Tom Donohue and NAM downtown, Victor Schwartz, have been working this thing for years. When we are asked about germane amendments, I think of the opportunity that I have in this perilous position, so to speak, with respect to the legislation. 
   Realizing that they are willing to amend the Constitution, article VII, taking away a trial by jury, and they are willing to amend article X of the rights of the States with respect to tort law, then I thought maybe at the moment it would be good to amend article II with respect to the bearing of arms. 
   Yes, Mr. President, I do have an amendment, and it is at the desk. It is very germane to our interest in real things. We are not really concerned at this minute, because the system is working. According to Business Week, according to the testimony, according to the evidence, according to the editorials, our tort system is working to protect doctors, small business folks and everyone else. What is not working in Colorado is this inordinate number of pistols and firearms in our society. 
   I came to the Senate as a strong-headed States righter and still try my best to follow that principle because I believe in it very, very strongly. However, I have had to yield with respect to that particular position when it came to the Saturday night specials. We had the FBI come with that. The States could not control that. We had the matter of assault weapons, and the States could not control that. 
   Then watching over the years, the States' response, instead of going in the direction of control, they actually are in the direction of running around with concealed weapons. All the States now are going in that direction. That is why the NRA, the National Rifle Association, was ready to meet in Denver last week. I figured we ought to bring this up for immediate discussion. 
   Rush to judgment? No; no. I have been there 33 years. I have watched this debate, I have listened, and I watched our society. It is not a rush to judgment. It is a judgment that I had a misgiving about over many years waiting on the States to respond. 
   I put at the desk the Chafee amendment relative to handgun control. I will be prepared later on, if we are allowed and we get into the debate, to bring that up, because I think it is very timely. It is not a rush to judgment. It is far more important to our society. According to Computerworld, according to the Oregonian, according to the New York Times, according to the witnesses, it is far more important than Y2K which may occur 7 or 8 months from now. Come; come. 
   We know good and well that everybody is getting ready. We have, in a bipartisan fashion, set aside the antitrust restrictions so that they could collaborate. 
   We have positive evidence of a young doctor in New Jersey who in 1996 bought a computer, and the salesman bragged how it can last for more than 10 years, that it was Y2K compliant. He gave references. By happenstance, they did go to one of the references and found out it was not Y2K compliant. 
   The young doctor then said: I need to get this thing modified and made compliant. The company that sold it to him said: Gladly, for $25,000. The main instrument itself was only $13,000. 
   What did he do? He wrote a letter and asked, and then he asked the second time. Months passed. He finally went to a lawyer. People do not like to go to lawyers and get involved in court. I hear all about frivolous lawsuits, frivolous, frivolous. Nobody has time for frivolous lawsuits. The real lawyer does not get paid unless he gets a result. 
   Finally, he did get a lawyer, and the lawyer was smart 
   enough to put it on the Internet. The next thing you know, there were 17,000 doctors in a similar situation with the same company, and they finally reached a settlement and got it replaced and made compliant--free. That was all that was necessary. 
   The system is working now. There have been 44 cases. Over half of them have been thrown out as frivolous; half of the remaining cases have been settled. There are only eight or nine pending Y2K cases. The problem is real. You do not have to wait if you are going to have those supplies. It is like an automobile dealer faced every year with a new model and has to get rid of the old. 
   You will find some of the various entities will come around and offload and misrepresent. That is why we have the tort system at the State level, and that is why it works, and that is why we have this wonderful economic boom. 
   There is a conspiracy. They call it a bunch of associations that have endorsed the legislation. They have come around now and said this is a wonderful opportunity, we can just ask them for tort reform, and here it is going to save them from lawyers and frivolous lawsuits.  
   If I was an innocent doctor in regular practice with no time to study and pay attention to these matters, I would say, ``Sure, put me on, that sounds good to me. I am having troubles enough now with Medicare and HCFA and all of these rules and regulations made ex post facto about charges for my particular treatments.'' 
   That is why it all builds and it mushrooms on the floor of the Senate. The Senator from South Carolina has been in the vineyards now 20 years on this one issue relative to trial lawyers and tort reform. He can see it like pornography. You understand it and know it when you see it, and I see this. 
   I was constrained on yesterday to not only put up the Chafee amendment relative to gun control, but more particularly, Mr. President, with respect to the violence in the schools. I know one of the causes. I have been fighting in that vineyard all during the nineties. We have had hearings on TV violence, and we have had study after study after study. They put us off again and again with another study. So in the Congress before last, we reported it out of committee 19 to 1 on barring gratuitous violence in these shows, excessive gratuitous violence. 
   When you run a Civil War series, necessarily you are going to have to have violent films and shots made and scenes that will appeal. But we got into the excessive gratuitous violence that they control in Europe, down in New Zealand and Australia. They use the one example, of course, in Scotland where they had the poor fellow who was estranged and insane come in and shoot up the little children. But they don't have this happening in Arkansas like it did or happening in Kentucky like it did. 
   You can see this occurring over the years. Monkey see, monkey do--youngsters emulate and they see more than anything else, not excessive gratuitous violence, but no cost, no result, no injury to the violence. Seemingly, it happens and you move right on. They become hardened. Then they go to the computer games shooting each other. 
   I called that bill up the Congress before last. We got it reported to the floor. I went to my friend, Senator Dole, who was running for President. He just returned from the west coast, and he had given the producers a fit. He said, ``You have to act more responsibly.'' 
   I said, ``Bob, why don't I step aside and you offer the bill and let it just be the Dole-Hollings bill? It is out here and reported. You put up one. You are the leader, and we can get a vote on that right quick.'' 
   We got a 19-to-1 vote in the committee. I never did get a response. So I put it in again, and in the last Congress it was reported out 20 to 1. But I cannot get the distinguished leader who wants to be oh so reasonable and everybody working together, and let's don't rush to judgment on TV violence--I have a judgment, and it is not a rush to it. It has been learned over the many, many years, looking at the experience of other countries, looking at the need in our society, having listened to the witnesses, the Attorney General saying this would pass constitutional muster with respect to the freedom of speech. 
   I wanted to bring that up. That amendment sat at the desk. That is important, far more important than Y2K. 
   And otherwise we have hard experiences. We Senators do get home from time to time, and we do politic. And it was about 4 years ago when I got back to Richland County where I met my friend, the sheriff, Senator Leon Lott. And he said, I want to show you a school out here that was the most violent, was infested with drugs and trouble and everything else of that kind. 
   He said, Senator, I took one of your cops on the beat. I put him in the classroom, in uniform, teaching classes, law, respect for the law, the penalties in driving for young folks coming along, the penalties, and why the controls in relation to respect and the severe penalties relative to drugs, so they would understand. 
   Now, that was in the classroom. He was not in the parking lot waiting for somebody to steal a car. Rather, he was teaching respect for the law. And then, in the afternoon, this particular officer was associated with the athletic activities, and in the evening with the civic activities. He became a role model. 
   I say this advisedly because I think about that poor security officer who did not know from ``sic em'' out there in the Columbine school in Colorado. Here they could unload pipe bombs, all kinds of pistols, all kinds of this, that, and everything else, like that going on the Internet, running down the halls in trench coats, butt everybody out of the way, and everything else. They were surprised by what happened. 
   So, yes, I have an amendment at the desk relative to our safe schools safety initiative because Senator GREGG, the chairman of our Subcommittee on State, Justice and Commerce--we put $160 million in the appropriations bill last year, and it is being used and employed with tremendous success all over the country. 
   The emphasis should be not as I heard on TV last night, where they said this law enforcement officer would be directly connected with law enforcement; I want him connected with the students. I want him to become a role model. I want him to understand and know the students and know the teachers. And the teachers know when they have a troublemaker, or whatever it is--a poor lad maybe does not have a mama or does not have a daddy, he is totally lost, so he brings about all kinds of extreme activity to get recognition. 
   But that officer can work. And we also added in counseling. I cannot have him do all the counseling and all the role modeling and everything else at once, as well as law enforcement, as well as instruction. So we included, after the advice from hearings, that we put in counseling; and we got a measure. It is on the statute books. It ought to be embellished and enlarged. 
   These are the kinds of things we ought to be talking about this afternoon rather than this bum's rush about a crisis that is going to happen 7 months from now. Come on. Here it is happening right underneath us and all we do is pray. We are the board of directors of corporate United States of America, and we are flunking our particular duties; we cannot pay any bills. 
   We talked all last week--and it is still on the calendar right now, and regular order--of saving 100 percent of Social Security, a lockbox. Then I heard instead the distinguished leader say, oh, no. He said, this money we are going to add on 
   to the President's request for Kosovo--another $6 billion. When asked, where is it going to come from, he said, from Social Security. 
   The truth of the matter is, they say that is the only surplus, but it is not. Social Security is $720 billion shy. And with the estimation--and I have it by the Congressional Budget Office--at the end of September this year we will owe--not surplus--Social Security $837 billion, because what we have been doing is we have been paying down the debt. 
   It is like taking two credit cards, having a Visa card and MasterCard, and saying, ``I'll pay off my MasterCard with the Visa card. It looks pretty good for the MasterCard debt--the public debt--but it increases the Visa debt over here--it increases the Social Security debt. So it has. And we owe Social Security $837 billion. The $137 billion in excess of what is required to be paid out this particular year is not surplus. 
   Under the law, 13301 of the Budget Act, it should go in reserve for Social Security for the baby boomers, but we are all talking about; oh, the President; oh, the Congress; no, the Congress; no, the President. Nobody wants to get a plan to save Social Security; and all the time we are stealing, we are looting the fund. It is a shame. It is a show. It is a spin. It is the message nonsense that you have up here in the Senate. 
   So let's get real now and let's get these issues out. Let's talk about handguns. Let's talk about Kosovo. Let's talk about TV violence. We have some real problems. Let's talk about paying the bill, and not any ``Mickey Mouse'' of one day it is going to be a lockbox and no one can get to it and 48 hours later saying, no, no, I'm going to use that lockbox for a $12 billion payment on Kosovo. We have to get honest with the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, reminds me of a happier day. I say a happier day most sincerely in the sense that we had not become subject to all the consultants, all the pollsters to the point whereby today, in large measure, we more or less are marionettes to the consultants' hot-button items and issues and not the needs of the people. 
   There was a tremendous respect on both sides of the aisle. I was elected in 1966. At that time, Senator Hruska was the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Jim  Eastland of Mississippi served as chairman. I remember the various measures that went before the Judiciary Committee for debate and action were those bills that were agreed upon by Senator Hruska and Senator Eastland. 
   Senator Hruska was a profound lawyer, and I say that advisedly in the sense of a little quibble. Everybody will remember or the media friends will remember when we were trying to nominate a Supreme Court Justice, that maybe he was not a graduate of Harvard and, therefore, sort of what they would call ``mediocre talent.'' That nettled the Senator from Nebraska and he said, ``Well, there are a lot of people in the land and a lot of lawyers of mediocre talent and maybe they need representation on the Court.'' 
   I remember him as a very erudite counsel who worked on these measures seriously and with purpose and was most respected. He has been a loss, I say to Senator HAGEL. He has been missed over the many years because he held the line. We deliberated in a bipartisan fashion, and he contributed to that bipartisan leadership which is so lacking today. 
   We ought to be working together. It would be a happier day. But, unfortunately, here we go again. The downtown crowd thinks they can embellish a computer glitch problem into a reform of the State tort laws with respect to joint and several liability, punitive damages, and everything else. As a result, it is a nonstarter. 
   Like last week, the folks thought it would be good, since the President said, ``I'm going to save 62 percent for Social Security,'' they one-upmanshipped and said, ``We'll save 100 percent,'' knowing all along the 100 percent going to pay down the debt was coming from Social Security, increasing the debt on Social Security, thereby savaging, not saving, the fund. But so it goes. 
   We do miss Senator Hruska. Mostly we miss his habits and his leadership and his balance in service. I think more than the balanced budget, what we need is balanced Senators. 
   With that, I yield the floor for a balanced Senator, the distinguished Senator from Arizona. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I yield myself so much time as may be permitted under the unanimous-consent agreement. 
   Pending the discussion with respect to the Y2K problem, let me say at the outset that if there were a Y2K problem, we on this side of the opposition, let's say, to the particular bill and the amendment forthcoming with respect  to Senator MCCAIN and Senator WYDEN, anything within reason obviously could have been worked out; namely, anyone who has a computer knows glitches. So no one can deny there cannot be a glitch on January 1 of the year 2000. However, there is not really a problem that would cause us to try to change tort law. That is what is in the offing here. 
   I have talked to the best of the best in the computer industry with the idea that we could compromise and give the 90-day grace period. 
   People do not want to go to court when they find out their computer is not working. If there is one thing that takes time--the Securities and Exchange Commission and so-called tort reform--they are still in discovery, they are still in appeals, and they are still in court, without trying the case, some 2 years later, because they have yet to determine what was intended. The same would be the case here trying to really venture into the State responsibility and jurisdiction with tort with so-called overall reform law. 
   So I thought, fine, let's get together on what could be called a glitch. Nobody wants to go to court. Give them some time to fix the glitch, and then move on in the business world. However, we have some friends down at the National Chamber of Commerce who are really bent on actually trying to pass product liability and do away with trial by jury and all the other State tort systems. 
   I could spot this in my particular position because I have been engaged in it for at least 20 years on the Commerce Committee from which it has been reported each time. We have prevailed over the 20 years. The reason we have prevailed is that the professionals in this particular field, whether it be the American Bar Association, the Association of State Legislatures, the Association of State Supreme Court Judges, the Association of Governors, until it was changed in effect, all opposed, and we were able to withstand the onslaught of this particular political move. 
   I can tell you, Madam President, we are going to withstand it again on Y2K, unless they come around, of course. But I 
   don't see a compromise in the offing. 
   So I think immediately of what should be discussed; namely, television violence. We started on that with hearings at the beginning of the 1990s. This is 1999. And this Senator introduced a TV violence bill. We reported it out at that time 19 to 1 from the Congress before the last. 
   I remember going up to Senator Dole, then majority leader, who was running for President, and saying, ``Look, we have got this bill out. The Attorney General has already attested to the fact that it would withstand constitutional muster on the freedom of speech provisions, and I will step aside if you want to make it. I am just interested in getting the bill, not the credit. So why don't you take the bill?'' 
   The point is that the distinguished Senator had just come in from the west coast, where he, if everyone will remember, had cussed out the movie industry for its gratuitous violence in all of its film making. So I thought it was a natural that he would want to follow through. He didn't. In the last Congress we then had it reported out by a vote of 20 to 0--TV violence. 
   This has nothing to do, of course, with the Nintendo games or the other little games they play on these machines. But it does have to do with the basic tendency towards violence without cost, without any harm, or injury, or feeling. 
   We understand, of course, when you document the civil rights, when you document the matter of the Civil War, or any of these other things, you have to show the violence associated therewith in order to make an honest depiction; that is going to be included. But we are talking about gratuitous, excessive violence not incidental to the plot. 
   The bill has been found to stand, as I say, constitutional muster. 
   So we wanted to control that. 
   I have that bill in again. I would rather think that really bowing to the Chamber of Commerce on particulars there with respect to State tort and State responsibilities--mind you me, my Republican friends in the leadership caterwaul that the best governed--or the less governed--that the best governed is at the local level. 
   Why not let these local school boards control, rather than mandate from Washington this, that, or the next thing? Now they come with a mandate that the States have not asked for and the States would certainly oppose. 
   I just talked to one of the great leaders in computerization who said, ``Senator, please don't pass this measure. The fact that companies don't get ready, they don't comply, is a competitive edge. My customers are checking them out. If they don't comply, I'm using that as a competitive advantage.'' 
   Let the market forces operate I say to those who always caterwaul about market forces and deregulation and wanting to regulate. 
   Back to the main point. We really ought to whip through a bill on television violence and control that. We have quite a case to present to the Congress itself. In the initial stage of broadcasting, programmers said in the booklets, ``Get a murder early on to hold the audience.'' They love violence, they love murders, so get in a murder scene. I can show you that word for word in the CBS program in the earlier stages of television. 
   We can also go to the Colorado case. About 4 years ago a solution was used that is working at this particular time. I went down to Columbia, SC, which is Richland County. The county sheriff, Leon Lott, said, ``Senator, I want to show you a school that was the most violent we had in the county--more drugs and trouble. We put a uniformed officer in the classroom.'' 
   Let me attest to this. I am not talking about some uniformed officer out in the parking lot looking for theft of the automobiles. I am talking about a law enforcement officer in contact with the students. This officer has not only taught the course, but associated himself in the afternoon with the athletic programs and in the evenings with the civic programs. If I had to pick a law enforcement officer, I would pick some all-American like our friend Bill Bradley--someone they look up to immediately, and put them in uniform. 
   It is not too much to teach respect and have him associated on the campus. He walks, talks and teaches with the students, listens to the teachers and the principals. The students know who brings a weapon to the school grounds. The students know who brings drugs on the school properties. All they do is just nod their head, make a little motion. That security officer gets the hint immediately and goes in way ahead of time--preventing violence, preventing drugs--and if need be, gets them counseling or whatever. 
   Senator GREGG and I provided just this kind of provision in the State-Justice-Commerce bill for the cops on the beat to be used. That is what Sheriff Lott was using in the Richland County schools. It is working in the other schools all over South Carolina. 
   My reaction at the time of the Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, was, Did they have an officer? I heard some reports which said yes. If they did, that officer ought to be fired. Anybody that can offload that much weaponry--that security officer doesn't know what is going on. He is not even taking 
   care of security. 
   The main thing is to become, as they have in this particular approach, a role model for the students themselves. You can't put sensitive devices in every school in America. And we are not going to do that. Praying and counseling are well and good, but let's go ahead with a tried and true provision and get some leadership now that we can see, again, more than ever the need. We can be discussing those things rather than some political fix that you find in the polls. 
   What about the lawyers? Every pollster and consultant says kill all the lawyers. That is popular. Reform, reform, reform; tort reform, get rid of the lawyers. Control their fees, control their verdicts, control the seventh amendment and the right of trial by jury. That is the whole scenario. We who understand and appreciate it and have been in the trenches now for 20 years are going to do our dead level best so that shall not go on. 
   I think this afternoon at 5:30 we can vote cloture. I needed the time because we were not given notice about this particular measure coming up, but we are going to have to do some more head counting. We will have to prepare some amendments and debate the real issues facing the American people--not those being taken care of by the Governors  and the States. All of the Senators running around trying to play catchup ball with the Governors from the elections last November, all those that got elected and preached ``education, education, education.'' 
   There is a primary responsibility of the Federal Government for national defense. A primary responsibility of the State government is education: 93 cents out of every education dollar is at the State or local level. We only have 6 or 7 cents that we can toy with. We cannot have all of that influence. We can come across with some good ideas in one particular State and try to make it possible on a pilot basis for other States and take the leadership that we gain locally and spread it. We support the Department of Education on that basis. 
   It is so ludicrous that those who came from the 1994 elections wanting to abolish the Department of Education are now running around throwing money at the Department of Education. It is all politics. 
   If we can stop using the government to get ourselves reelected with these silly consultants and what shows up in the poll, but what shows up on the front page. We know the need nationally to pay our bills. We had a debate about that--it was totally disregarded--all last week: ``Save Social Security 100 percent.'' That was the majority leader's amendment. 
   Madam President, I turned on the TV and he said the $6 billion for Kosovo was not enough; we will have to add another $6 billion. When asked where they will get the money, he said, ``From Social Security.'' 
   That is not the only surplus. That is the only way to hide it. But you can get $12 billion surplus from the civil service retirement fund, which they have been doing, and from the military retirement fund, which they have been using, but the mindset is immediately to go and spend Social Security to savage the fund. 
   There again was another political charade. Today we are engaged in another political charade. 
   At this particular time, with respect to the motion to proceed, I do not see much interest in actually debating. When the proponents come to the floor, I would like an opportunity to make a few points relative to the demerits of this particular measure, why it should not be enacted, and get their response. Thereby, Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, our chairman, talked about frivolous lawsuits and deep pockets and glitches. It strikes this Senator that what we have ongoing at the moment are computer glitches. Every now and again, we all run into it--on my computer and others' around. Certainly it is an industry that has deep pockets, is worth billions of dollars, and some never have made a profit. But the market is valuable, with investments in the billions of dollars. So with glitches and deep pockets, you would think, by the description about frivolous lawsuits, that there would be lawyers all running around with frivolous lawsuits, saying, ``they got deep pockets,'' and there are glitches, and everybody would be suing everybody. 
   Of course, that just proves the contention of the need for this bill. You go from the different styles. I was here when they went after the oil money. I was here when the oil went after the milk money. Now, in 2000, they are going after Silicon Valley and everybody is running out there to get their money and their blessing, and they never had any lawyers before, or any representatives. Now they have them all marching into Washington. But other than the politics, the business community is taking care of it. 
   I refer, if the distinguished Presiding Officer pleases, to the March 1 issue of Business Week. On page 30, it says:  
   Lloyd Davis is feeling squeezed. In 1998, his $2 million, 25-employee fertilizer-equipment business was buffeted by the harsh winds that swept the farm community. This year, his Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies, Inc. in Colby, Kansas, is getting slammed by Y2K. Davis needs $71,000 to make his computer systems bug-free by January 1. But he has been able to rustle up only the $39,000. His bank has denied him a loan because--ironically--he's not Y2K-ready. But Davis knows he must make the fixes or lose business. ``Our big customers aren't going to wait much longer,'' he frets. 
   Golden Plains and thousands of other small businesses are getting a dire ultimatum from the big corporations they sell to: Get ready for Y2K, or get lost. Multinationals such as General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, and Deere are making the first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for partners and vendors to prove they're bug-free. A recent survey by consultants at Gemini America says 69 percent of the 2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with companies that can't pass muster. The National Federation of Independent Business figures more than 1 million companies with 100 workers or fewer won't make the cut, and as many as half will lose big chunks of business or even fail. 
   I am glad the market is taking care of them so we will not have to sue them. So the products we get will be sound.  
   Reading further:  
   Cutting thousands of companies out of the supply chain might strain supply lines and could even crimp output. But most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run to avoid bugs in the first place. 
   But most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run to avoid bugs in the first place.  
   Here they have 7 1/2 months to get rid of the bugs. Here, with this particular article, they had 10 months to get rid of all the bugs. The technology has been on course for over 30 years. Everyone has been talking about it. We passed special legislation in the debate last year to set aside the antitrust provisions so they could work together. And, yet, some still are going to lag and not do business. 
   This is why one of the leading computerization experts in the world just an hour ago in my office said, ``Senator, don't pass this bill.'' He said, ``I will use it for competition.'' Those who do not compete, who won't comply, and who won't get Y2K ready, ought to fall by the wayside, as this article and my friend were pointing out. 
   I quote again from the article:  
   Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, and it continues to look for weak links, says the Vice President for Information Systems at the company. At Citibank ..... cuts have already been made.  
   Reading again:  
   Big U.S. companies are not sugarcoating the problem. 
   ..... ``if a vendor is not up to speed by April or May,'' Rabat says, ``it's serious crunch time.''  
   Here it is 6 months away. We are going to pass emergency legislation for glitches and deep pockets. We have had glitches and deep pockets all during the 1990s, and there is no trillion dollars' worth of lawsuits and frivolous lawsuits. 
   That gets me to the point where I can tell you that the real lawyers who bring any cases don't have any time to bring frivolous lawsuits. They are not worth it. They can't get anything for it. And they don't get paid unless they win. And if they win, they have to prove to a 12-man jury and withstand all of the legal motions, delays, and everything else. So the real attorneys just do not bring frivolous lawsuits. 
   Later, when we get into the full debate on the measure, I will have the documents to prove that from the Rand Corporation. 
   Quoting further from the article:  
   Through the Automotive Industry Action Group, GM and other car makers have set March 31 deadlines for vendors to become Y2K compliant.  
   Madam President, that is just 5 days from now.  
   In March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are sending a warning to laggards--and shifting business to the tech-savvy. ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize the supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, ARK.  
   There is a statement. This particular so-called ``problem'' is cleaning out the inept, the inadequate, the incompetent, the uncompliant. But what they want to do is pass laws and change around all the States' tort systems for manufactured product downtown at the Chamber of Commerce, and that you will find in the political polls, so we can write out to Silicon Valley and say, ``Look what I have done for you. I am looking out for you. Just contribute to my campaign.'' 
   That is all this is--another political exercise this week. 
   Quoting further:  
   The World Bank has shelled out $72 million in loans and grants to Y2K-stressed nations, including Argentina and Sri Lanka. AT&T alone has spent $900 million fixing its systems.  
   It goes on and on in the article. 
   Madam President, the point here is, we are trying to solve a political problem, not a business problem. It is one to get the contributions from Silicon Valley. It is one that has put up a straw man about a trillion dollars' worth of verdicts and all of that. That is outrageous nonsense. We haven't had over $12 billion in product liability cumulatively in this Nation since the incidents of product liability, but every week we see some automobile company recalling 100,000. The week before last, it was a 1-million-car callback for retrofitting and everything else. Why? Because some good trial lawyer brought some good case and on the safety basis has saved many, many from injury and death. 
   No. I take the position of the lawyers in reality who really try the cases. They have deep pockets, and they are all there now, and they are all prospering and making more money. They haven't come to Washington to say, ``Look, you know the changes that we have in computers.'' They change every other year--now almost yearly. So there is another new model. So there is a glitch. But people do not run around suing everybody on some kind of glitch. It is a business contract in the purchase under the Uniform Commercial Code to be controlled, and only when there is a fraudulent breach do we get into law, and tort law, which is State tort law. 
   I don't think we are going to change under this stampede here about what a grand thing we have--bipartisanship. Oh, no. It is as partisan as it can be for those trying to get their money, be they Republican or Democrat, out there in the Silicon Valley campaign. 
   I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum to be divided by unanimous consent between both sides.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation to help parents limit the amount of television violence coming into their homes. We have reviewed this issue for decades and the analysis has not changed. All of the assurances and promises have been insufficient to protect our children from the dangerous influence of television violence.  
   The bill that I introduce today requires a safeharbor time period during which broadcasters and basic cable programmers would not be permitted to transmit violent programming. The legislation directs the Federal Communications Commission to develop an appropriate safeharbor time period to protect television audiences that are likely to be comprised of a substantial number of children. 
   We can argue all day long about which study reaches what conclusion about the impacts of television violence. But it defies common sense to believe that television violence does not impact our kids in some adverse way. Even the National Cable Television Association's own study on television violence states that the ``evidence of the harmful effects associated with televised violence'' is ``firmly established.'' 
   The recent events in Littleton, Colorado serve to highlight the sad and unfortunate fact that violence in our culture is begetting violence by our youths. violence is everywhere, it is readily accessible, and, to make matters worse, it is a source of corporate profits. A recent Washington Post article entitled, ``When Death Imitates Art,'' made this very point. It states:  
   For young people, the culture at large is bathed in blood and violence ..... where the more extreme the message, the more over the top gruesomeness, the better. ..... Film, television, music, dress, technology, games: They've become one giant playground filled with accessible evil, darker than ever before.  
   While we know we can't regulate every market and every technology, and don't want to, we also know that the purveyors of violence must be held accountable in those instances when we can do so, consistent with our values and our Constitution. One way to do this is through television programming. 
   This approach has already been successfully applied to television with respect to indecent programming, for which a safeharbor has been on the books since 1992--an approach that the D.C. Circuit has validated. I am confident that a similar result would be obtained if the video programming industry or First Amendment advocates were to attack this legislation that I introduce today. Indeed, prior legislative history also substantiates the constitutionality of my approach. In 1993, when I introduced my safeharbor legislation for the first time, the Commerce Committee held a hearing at which Attorney General Janet Reno and FCC Commissioner Reed Hundt both testified that the bill was constitutional. 
   Now, I know that there will be opponents of this legislation who will state that the ratings system is working, that the V-chip is being deployed, and that our parents are being armed with the tools to protect their children from television violence. I also know that some Senators wrote a letter in July 1997, suggesting that the government forbear from regulation TV violence. But I'm not convinced. We should not forbear from protecting our children. 
   Besides, the ratings system is incomplete. For example, one major broadcast network refuses to this day to use content ratings, and one major cable channel refuses to use any ratings at all. We all know what is going on here--money talks and violence sells. A recent article in USA Today illustrates this point. Entitled ``TV Violence for Profit,'' the article reports that some TV networks and basic cable channels increase the amount of violent programming during ``sweeps--the key months when Nielson measures audience size in every market.'' 
   Regardless, even if the industry is right that the V-Chip will eventually be the magic solution, we all know that thousands, and perhaps millions of families, will be without a V-chip for years. The V-chip is not required by the FCC to be manufactured in all television until January 1, 2000. Will every parent go to Circuit City on New Year's day and buy a new TV with a V-chip? Of course not. The V-Chip is not a complete solution. The only complete solution is a safeharbor. 
   To conclude, I want to stress that this is an issue about accountability and responsibility. Those responsible for supplying video programming have been granted a public trust through the availability of broadcast spectrum and FCC licenses to deliver their programming to America's children. They should be responsible in their programming choices. We know, however, that market forces may encourage them to be irresponsible and transmit excessive violent programming. We in the Congress therefore have a responsibility to hold them accountable. This legislation does just that.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. While spending every dime of the trust fund, we reduce the public debt, so that what we have is the unified debt. I have heard the Senator and everybody else say, this time, leave it out of the unified deficit. That is how you bring out the unified deficit, and rather than the regular deficit, and the unified budget; isn't that correct?

That is the whole point I am trying to make--the same point the Senator from Wyoming is making--that we have been robbing the Social Security piggy bank, as I show you here, and other banks, incidentally, whereby this year we owe Social Security $857 billion.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Then we apply it using these trust funds to pay down the debt. That is what we have been doing, by any and every other program, whether it is a tax cut, whether it is  defense spending, whether it is disaster in the farm areas, whatever it is. That runs up the debt. When you pay down the debt, you get to the unified deficit. 
   That is what they have all been bragging about--how the unified deficit has been coming down and we have a surplus. We don't have an actual surplus. We spend $100 billion more than we take in this year--$100 billion more than we take in this year. But yet we say we have a surplus, because it is unified, because we have used Social Security to pay down the public debt.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas said we ought to have a good political debate, and he allows me to make a good political debate in that he made it political talking about Democrats and taxes and the wealthy. 
   The truth of the matter is, that is how the economy got this way, outstandingly good, in that we taxed the wealthy back in 1993 on Social Security. It was that gentleman, the Senator from Texas, who said they are going to be hunting us down in the street and shooting us like dogs. 
   He raises these strawmen. Another strawman--I am going to use his text; I wouldn't say these things if I couldn't back them up--he says, the trouble here is that we feel that a lockbox is a dangerous thing. 
   That is exactly what he said back in July 1990. I made the motion on the Budget Committee and we voted 19 to 1 for a lockbox, bipartisan except for one. It was the distinguished Senator from Texas who said it was a dangerous thing. But we went ahead, passed it in the House and Senate, and President George Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed that lockbox into law. That lockbox is part of the amendment of the majority leader and the Senator from Michigan. Look on page 3. You see they reiterate 13301, but on page 10 they take it away. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer heard me tell about that insurance company slogan that ``Capital Life will surely pay, if the small print on the back don't take it away.'' 
   My Republican colleague talked about how we always get into a wealth argument. They get into any and every effort to get rid of Social Security. They don't like it. In 1964, I remember, in the Goldwater campaign, they were going to abolish Social Security. In 1990, I finally got the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Heinz, to agree with me, and he changed around the mindset. I wish we had him here now and in the caucus to straighten out this nonsense, because what they are doing is exactly what they are not doing. They guarantee that every dime that is spent is going to be spent on either tax cuts or other spending rather than Social Security, when you pay down the debt. That is what they are saying. 
   How is the debt caused? The debt is caused by spending too much. Spending too much on what? Any and every program. It could be defense. It could be Kosovo. It could be food stamps. It could be foreign aid. It could be law enforcement. But when you spend too much, you have a debt. 
   We haven't spent too much on Social Security. That is one particular point on which I agree with the distinguished Senator from Texas. When he says, plundering, plundering--I use the word ``loot''--we can just say: Trust funds plundered in order to give that balanced budget, that unified budget, that unified debt--you don't hear that word--that is the same thing as paying down the public debt. 
   So, yes, we plundered Social Security for $857 billion, and we plundered military retirement, civil retirement, unemployment, highway, airport, and even Medicare, and we have been violating our very doctrine, making it a criminal penalty to use trust funds, pension funds, to pay the company debt. That is the Pension Act of 1994. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer--he and I ended up talking about Denny McLain. I won't have to say that again. I can tell you now what we say in the private economy is, if you use the company pension fund to pay down the company debt, it is a felony. But it is good Government up here. 
   But back to my poor Republican friends. Not only '64 and '90, but in '93 we got to the balanced budget amendment and we said, gentlemen, on the other side of the aisle, I will vote for you on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution if you do not plunder Social Security. It is section 7, on page 5--I remember it well--where they said, no, we have to still plunder it. They could have gotten a group of us Senators on this side of the aisle, but they demanded to plunder Social Security. Then, Mr. President, right on up to the present date, read what they say. They say that the surplus shall not be used for non-Social Security  spending or tax cuts, but then when they say it uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt, that is exactly what it does. 
   The distinguished Senator from Texas says there is no plan here to save Social Security or make up for its debt. Why don't we say, use the Social Security surplus for only Social Security purposes, namely, pay down the $857 billion we owe it? They don't come and say that, Mr. President, no siree. They just demand, at every particular turn, that we get rid of it and now they want to privatize it. I refer, of course, to the particular language in section 202 of the budget resolution that they just brought in here as a group. This says that when the Committee on Ways and Means of the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate gets a conference report submitted that enhances retirement security--that is nebulous; they think it is enhanced when they savage it, plunder it--through structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on the Budget--that means Mr. KASICH on the House side and Mr. DOMENICI on the Senate side--they can do anything: increase the appropriate allocations and aggregates of the budget authority; they can adjust the levels to determine compliance with pay-as-you-go, which in essence repeals the pay-as-you-go provision; and they can reduce the revenue aggregates. 
   What does it mean? You have to call New Mexico and find out from the Senator from New Mexico what it means. That is what is going to happen. Monkeyshines here is going into the particular amendment. 
   I can tell you here and now, Mr. President, that this is really a disaster. What we are doing is formalizing spending, spending all the Social Security surplus. At least the President of the United States says he wants to save 62 percent and he is going to spend 38 percent on something else. That is what the President said in his budget. We are going to save 62 percent, but we are going to spend 38 percent on something else. 
   Do you know what this Republican amendment says? It says we want to make sure we spend 100 percent on something else because it is not for Social Security, it is for the debt. When they use that euphemism ``public debt,'' as I have explained many times, you have an American Express and a Visa card. The Senator from Texas has abandoned Dickie Flats; he has gone to Joe and Sarah Brown. He says when Joe and Sarah Brown sit around the kitchen table and pay their bills--but I can tell you what Joe and Sarah Brown never do: They don't take their Visa card and pay off their American Express. But that's what this amendment does. It says take your Social Security card, the surplus, and pay off the debt of any and every other program or tax cut--100 percent. They formalize what we tried to stop having been done in the law, when we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1990. This amendment repeals that particular discipline, the pay-as-you-go program. It goes right on down there plundering. That is all it can be used for. It can't be used for Social Security. There, Mr. President, is the fiscal cancer. This Senator has been working on it for years.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as you pay down the debt--that was the unified--that is how it was going down. That is where they got here this year to talk about a surplus for the first time. But we got together with the Concord Coalition and we got together with Barrons and several other responsible groups and they said there isn't any surplus. This Barrons headline says, ``Hey, Guys, There is No Budget Surplus.'' 
   The only reason they can call it a surplus is because of what they recommend in this amendment, paying down the public debt. That is the unified budget. But in the regular overall budget, the debt continues to increase and increase, and the interest costs continue to increase and increase, and you can't give a tax cut without raising taxes. You can't just cut your revenues without increasing your debt. 
   We have had all the spending cuts for 8 years of Reagan, 4 years of Bush, 6 years of Clinton. Nobody is recommending around here any cut in spending. The first order of business was $18 billion more for the military pay. The next order of business we are going to vote on is another $6 billion to $10 billion for Kosovo. Everybody is going to support that. So the spending goes up, up and away. We are down to bare bones. Yes, instead of abolishing the Department of Education, now they want to increase spending for education. So we can save, and the Presiding Officer can save, $10 billion or $20 billion; any individual can. But, collectively, as a Congress, we are not going to do it. What happens is that we need revenues in here, and we need to quit playing the game of paying down the public debt. 
   Our problem is that the White House doesn't know how to run a war and our Republican Congress doesn't know how to run a peace. They come up here with this Mickey Mouse amendment, saying exactly the opposite of what it really provides. They say you can't use it or any spending. You have to use it on all spending but Social Security, because you are using Social Security money. You can't use it on tax cuts, you have to use it for tax cuts. Certainly, you can't use it for Social Security.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to the Y2K problem, it is very interesting to note, the problem has been prepared for technologically, by the very groups they say the bill is to protect, for 30 years. They have the technology. There is no hocus-pocus about that. 
   I wish everyone would look back about 4 weeks ago and pull out of an edition of Business Week an extensive article to the effect that the market force is working. Large businesses, the GEs, the Ford Motors, the Xeroxes, the IBMs and everybody else, working with their suppliers down the line, have long since put them on notice. I do not have my file with me, but the drop dead date is the end of this particular month, April 1999, where you still have several more months to comply. But the market, knowing the technology is there, knowing of course you are going to be facing this, is trying to, like a Paul Revere, wake the town and tell the people. And they have been doing it. We did it last year, on a bipartisan basis, when we said: ``Wait a minute, if we cannot work these problems out, we will be slammed with antitrust.'' We got together quickly, the Senator from Connecticut and others, and on a bipartisan basis we passed that measure. Everything has been working fine. 
   I spoke earlier this year--I do not want to mislead--I spoke with my friend, Mr. Andy Grove of Intel, who is very much concerned about proportionality. But other than that, we spent a good hour in my office talking about large computerization and everything else. That community knows. They are way ahead of lawyers and lawsuits, I can tell you that, as the business leaders. 
   William Gates--Bill Gates, out at Davos, Switzerland, at the conference, said there was no problem. And this past week the New York Times wrote a summary article on the Y2K problem. 
   Mind you me, this is the middle of April 1999, months ahead, of course, of January 2000. They said people are moving along and everything else. You see, it is a practical problem. There is a bunch of old equipment on hand. Every automobile dealer faces this every year because they are going to bring out another model. So they all know about bringing out new models and everything else like that. Of course the new model needed for 2000 is the Year 2000-compliant model. 
   But what happens is that a side group has come in, upon this particular concern and interest, not at all interested in the Y2K. We could win this debate hands down on Y2K. But they are interested in distorting the tort liability laws of America. They have been about it and I have been with them for 20 years. There is a wonderful gentleman named Victor Schwartz with the National Association of Manufacturers, and he sends me a wonderful Christmas greeting, thanking me for the wonderful year he has had, because I keep his clients current as long as we can continue to defeat product liability. 
   But now we have another gentleman who has come over to the Chamber of Commerce named Tom Donohue, and I know him well. I worked with him in the Truckers'. He is coordinating this conspiracy. There is a great problem. ``We have legitimate business folks in the computerization business who are going to front for us. We don't want to argue about taking away the rights of trial by jury that we have beat upon.'' They don't want to have to take on the Association of State Supreme Court Justices 
   and everything else of that kind. ``We want to talk about Y2K, Y2K, Y2K, crisis, crisis, crisis.'' And they even act like there is one, 7 months ahead of time.  
   My little State of South Carolina just reported they would be compliant in July of this particular year, 1999. If South Carolina can get ready, everybody and anybody can get ready by the year 2000, I can tell you that. But they come in under the auspices of a crisis, to try to change punitive damages, try to change trial by jury, try to change joint and several liability--they are trying to change it all. Anywhere they can get a foot in the door for this particular precedent by this particular Congress under the general phraseology ``tort reform,'' they think they are home free. And I am afraid they would be. 
   The truth of the matter is, under the present legal system of the States', we are having the finest, most booming economy you have ever seen. The stock market has gone over 10,000, the interest rates are low, the unemployment rate is about the lowest it has ever been in 30 years, and right on down the list. So what you are finding out, right to the point, is that there is not a problem. Business is doing well. 
   In fact, the analysis done in this particular debate over 20 years has found it has not been greedy trial lawyers bringing fanciful suits with no substance whatsoever, just harassing. Mr. President, the good trial lawyer has no time for that nonsense. He does not get paid until he wins. He has to prevail. He has to come to court, he has to prove his case by the greater preponderance of evidence. He has to get not just 5 or 6 votes, he has to get all 12 votes. Then he has to go through the obstacle course of an appeal to the Supreme Court. Why? Because corporate America continues to get paid as long as the clock runs. 
   It is a tragic thing that has been occurring in the system of jurisprudence in America, because I practiced law for 20 years and I practiced representing businesses, incorporated and otherwise, but predominantly on the trial side with poor clients. I did not get a recovery unless the client got a recovery. 
   I was against continuances, against motions, against more depositions, against more discoveries. You see that mahogany-wall, oriental-rug crowd down here. There are 60,000 registered to practice in the District of Columbia trying to fix your vote and my vote, just fixing juries. They will never get to the courtroom. They sit around and tell the clients: Come on, computer industry, we can change the tort system so we can take away the rights of the very group, Mr. President, that it is supposed to protect--mainly small business. 
   They have the National Federation of Independent Businesses. That is the small business group that the law now protects. Instead, under the bill as proposed, a small business owner will have to wait 90 days before he or she could bring proceedings in court to recover damages. They know at the very beginning what is contracted for and what is wrong, but this requirement is going to delay them, increasing the time and costs of the suit. Then you have to prove various other measures by one of the highest standards of proof, almost like in a civil case. In cases where a party generally is required to prove by a preponderance, they seek to have the standard to be clear and convincing. 
   I say that advisedly because with this particular system, as it has worked out over the years--come to South Carolina. We had tort reform, but I have, they say, the competitive businesses. I am bringing in the Hondas, the BMWs, as well as the expansion of the GEs and other industries from all over the United States and the world coming into South Carolina where we have a civil statewide tort system. 
   Actually, these contracts are under the Uniform Commercial Code and ought to be tried on a contract basis. But, no, they do not want to even talk about the defect in the entire measure. The measure is not needed. The measure is misguided. The measure is an adulteration of the system, and bringing it to the Federal level, trying to tell the States--and that is what I hear from the other side of the aisle, that the people back home know best, they keep quoting Jefferson to me, less Government, let the States operate and everything else of that kind. They do that until they get something for big business. Now they want to come in and make sure they can have that clock run, that they can make a fortune, and the little man cannot even afford to bring his particular action. 
   I have every objection in the world to this measure. I do not mind compromising. I have always dealt with that particular approach for the almost 50 years now that I have been in public service. But I can tell you what this is. This is not Y2K. They have everybody running all around. Look at the morning Washington Post and you will see the different people. It is like: ``Sooey, pig, you come, we got them, we're going to get you to do this, get them to do that,'' and take the person who has made the contract--and right now they can look at their contract and see what is what in April 1999, months ahead of January 1. 
   They know whether they have the bad model or the right contract, and they know what is going to be required. This really allows an industry to offload all the old stuff and then come in with an adaptation next year that is going to cost over and above the particular computer. 
   It is bad business. It really distorts the jury system and the tried-and-true system of American jurisprudence. That is why I had to object, because I have been busy on this other farce, this so-called lockbox that allows everybody to have the 
   key but the poor Social Security crowd that is bringing about the surplus. There is not any question about that farce that is going on. They are just trying to make for a TV short in next year's campaign. We are going to make TV spots and show the inaccuracy of it. That is exactly what we have been doing, paying down public debt with Social Security money, thereby running up, up, up and away the Social Security debt. When you pay down someone else's debt with your money, you incur an indebtedness increase in your own program, namely Social Security. 
   There we are. They are trying their best to ram it through on Y2K, and they are all going around oozing and goozing how reasonable we are and we are trying to work this out. It ought to be killed dead in its tracks. Anybody who is looking out for the individual rights of the small businessman, the little doctor, the little law firm--any little business person who does not keep a lawyer on retainer and they have an instrumentality, namely a computer, that they say is ready to comply, and then they find out it does not comply, that is a breach of contract under the Uniform Contract Code. They can bring that action. Mr. President, unless there is a fraudulent breach, it does not come under tort law, it comes under the contract law. 
   Incidentally, it is businesses suing businesses. That is the big logjam. Any study, any research done with respect to the actual increase in the volume of lawsuits in America will find businesses suing businesses. I am exhibit 1 on this particular issue, for the main and simple reason, we worked for 4 years to get through the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Once we got it through, rather than businesses doing what they said, namely competing, they all started with their lawyers: It was unconstitutional, take it up to this court--they have all been in court. Why? The ratepayers are paying for the lawyers. It does not cost them any money, and they are going around buying up each other, combining rather than competing. 
   They have a legal game going, which is in some measure the same thing they had going with AT&T that caused Judge Greene to break it up. It seems to me that we are going to have to break it up again. That is what we are looking at now with the FCC: getting a drop-dead date for them to comply with the law that they wrote. 
   They do not want to comply. They want to combine. They want to use their monopolistic powers with their lawyers in business. But it is not the poor little injured party in court with a jury trial that is at issue, generally speaking, with respect to Y2K. It is the downtown crowd that is scaring up clients and scaring up fees and scaring up activity against the States. 
   The States have their own laws. The State of Illinois is well regarded as a place of high jurisprudence, and they do not need the Federal Government coming in and telling them how to protect the little man. Here, under the auspices of protecting the little man, we are going to take away his rights and drag him out, as if he had a lawyer  waiting. It is to discourage the little man's day in court. That is why we will be watching it very closely. 
   I don't know that this one will be worked out. In all reality, I think we can get the votes--not necessarily on the matter of proceeding. We do not mind proceeding, we are just trying to get the time. We can get the votes on the cloture to kill this measure. 
   If the computer industry is really serious about it, there may be some compromise, but for this particular Senator, I have no plans at all of compromising on the fundamental constitutional rights of a trial by jury and what the States have developed over many, many years, which is the finest business environment that exists in the world today. Nothing is hurting them. I do not have any of these foreign industries coming in and saying, ``But, Senator, we're worried about product liability, we are worried about joint and several, we are worried about trial by jury, we are worried about all these other punitive damages.'' 
   You do not hear that until you can get politicians running for national office, and then they put it in the polls. 
   Under ``Henry V,'' Shakespeare said, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' Of course, it was the biggest compliment. The only way that individual rights and freedom could not be sustained is to kill off the crowd that was going to protect individual rights and freedom. So it really was the greatest of all compliments. It was not that they were against lawyers, but they knew how to start anarchy. So that is what they told Dick the Butcher when they shouted, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' 
   That is what you have on Monday when we get to the regular debate. We will see which lawyer crowd we are going to kill off. 
   I yield the floor.

What I am trying to distinguish here, and asking the question, is the doubletalk, which obviously when you say ``every nickel'' used to reform or pay for Social Security or pay down the debt, now when you use moneys to pay down the debt, that is not for Social Security.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. How do you pay down the debt with Social Security money, thereby causing a debt in Social Security? Social Security, I ask the distinguished Senator, is not responsible for the debt. In fact, Social Security is running a surplus, a surplus which was created intentionally to help fund the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. 
   So let's both agree that Social Security hasn't caused the debt.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. When you use the expression ``to pay down the national debt,'' or the ``public debt,'' or whatever debt, it is debt caused by spending, or by tax cuts, or both. So you are not using every nickel for Social Security. On the contrary, what you are using is Social Security moneys to pay other debts for any and every purpose but Social Security. 
   I don't understand the distinguished Senator coming along and supporting this. I don't want to see him get in trouble, because I am going to ask the majority leader to pull this amendment down. They don't want a vote on this. What he is saying is that he wants to save Social Security. I have the quotations in the file of everyone.  
   Senator DOMENICI says ``every nickel'' to be spent on Social Security. Senator GRAMM says ``every nickel'' to be spent on Social Security. I come in on the floor, and Senator ABRAHAM says ``every nickel'' to be spent on Social Security. Then when you use the expression ``pay down the debt,'' which everybody wants, I agree with that. But when you use that expression and use that legislation, the amendment, to pay down the debt, in essence what you are saying is you are going to use Social Security, not for ``every nickel'' on Social Security, but for every nickel on any and everything other than Social Security.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I will get into the point about the national debt. I wish, as the Senator just outlined, ``pay down the national debt''--the truth of the matter is paying down the public debt has caused the national debt to continue to rise. We are not paying down the national debt. 
   I wish Mr. Greenspan and Chairman DOMENICI, and all the rest who are talking about paying down the debt, would say, just as the Senator from Michigan has said, pay down the national debt, but the assumption is you have money left over. The truth of the matter is having used Social Security over the last several years, since 1983, to pay down the public debt, we now owe. We don't have a surplus in Social Security. This year the Social Security surplus is estimated to be $127 billion, but by the end of the year we actually will owe $857 billion to Social Security. Why? Because we loot money from the trust fund and use it for other things. 
   That is my problem. And it was intended for the surplus money to stay there and to earn under section 201, in regular Treasury bills, government securities. And this year, if left untouched, it would earn almost $50 billion in interest for the Social Security trust fund. 
   Incidentally, I know the Senator is a good businessman. That is the policy for corporate America. We make it a felony to pay down the company debt with the pension fund. Here we are paying down the government debt, whether it is public or the national debt, we are paying down the debt with Social Security, or the pension money, where it is a felony in private practice. We think that is a wonderful policy.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Michigan yielding and engaging in a colloquy with me. 
   Moving right to the point, it is not a question of this particular approach or that particular approach. It is this particular amendment by the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I think it ought to be withdrawn. 
   What has been prompting this maneuver? They have been planning to see how in the world they could kill the President's program in one instrument while ensuring a tax cut on the other hand. In order to do that, they brought out the budget resolution with all that language I pointed out earlier yesterday repealing the pay-go rule. After repealing that pay-go rule, they can come in later with tax cuts. 
   Incidentally, the tax cut is going to be scheduled so that it brings in, over the first 5 years, only a tax cut of about $142 billion; but over the next 5 years, $736 billion. That is how they get by the pay-go rule with that language in the concurrent resolution. 
   Reading from the handout from the distinguished majority leader, and the author, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, it ``uses Social Security surplus to reduce debt held by public.'' What they are saying is they are using Social Security money to pay a debt. 
   Now, if it was to pay the debt owed Social Security, the $857 billion which we will owe at the end of this year. Why is that? Because we have been paying down the public debt with Social Security trust funds. That is exactly why there is a debt in Social Security. Under the policy set by this particular amendment, you say that is exactly what we love to do, we are going to use the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the public. 
   This activity is illegal, in the sense that section 13301 of the Budget Act says you cannot use the particular moneys of Social Security in the general budget. There should never be a budget reported using Social Security moneys by the Congress, by the President, or in the budget resolution. That law, the Budget Act of 1990, was signed by President Bush. I heard a Member mention 99 Senators; 98 Senators, bipartisan, voted for section 13301, but that has been violated ever since its enactment, and that is why the debt continues to grow. 
   Now, I would shut up, sit down, and take my seat if this amendment said ``use Social Security surplus to pay down the Social Security debt,'' but you are going to use the Social Security surplus to pay down any and every debt but the debt in Social Security and in the same breath say we want to save Social Security and this is how--put it in a lockbox. You say we will put it in a lockbox, and every nickel will be used for Social Security, yet this amendment actually guarantees that every nickel of that surplus will be used for any and every thing but Social Security. 
   I am sure the Senator from Michigan wants to look at that closely with the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, because I had this particular debate last year in the election. My poor Republican opponent came with the same kind of language, and we put him right. We have different organizations to save Social Security. Max Richmond and the rest came down and gave me an award. This is a fact. 
   And we wonder why there is no confidence in the Congress and why our  Republicans get in trouble on Social Security. They get in trouble on Social Security because they tried to take it away in 1986. That is when they lost the U.S. Senate. Then they fought me. I finally embarrassed them into voting in 1990 to save it. I thought they would obey their own law. They didn't. 
   Now, in an effort to get on top of the Social Security, they put out the rhetoric that every nickel is going to be saved for Social Security. I can state in this submission exactly what was said. Senator DOMENICI, the chairman, when asked, ``Why is that the case?'' ``Because we say put 100 percent of the accumulated surplus that belongs in the trust fund in the trust fund.'' 
   That isn't what the amendment says. It doesn't say, ``keep it in the trust fund.'' It says, ``use the money to reduce the debt''--any and every debt. 
   How is the debt caused? Kosovo spending. How is the debt caused? Military pay. How is the debt caused? Foreign aid. Any and every program. 
   The distinguished Senator from Michigan said that the Commerce Department was running up a debt unnecessary to the Department--abolish the Department. We are going to use Social Security money to pay for the Commerce Department--the very Department that the distinguished Senator said we ought to abolish. 
   Let me read further. Here is the chairman of the Budget Committee:  
   In addition, for those who are wondering what we are doing about Social Security and what the President does about it, let me remind you, we do not spend one nickel of Social Security, of their money, for any new program. When the President of the United States spent $158 billion in the first 5 years out of Social Security trust fund without any apologies, just said spend it, we say ``Don't spend it, keep it in the trust fund and put it in a statutorily created lockbox that would be tied to debt so it never can be spent.''  
   Further down:  
   You do not have to be worried whether that Social Security trust fund is going to be used for tax cuts because we cannot direct that any of that money be used for tax cuts. It can be used for the debt caused by tax cuts.  
   They are running around wanting to reduce the debt. How can you reduce the debt by giving an across-the-board tax cut? That reduces your revenues and causes the debt to increase. 
   Senator GRAMM says:  
   What this budget does on Social Security is very, very simple. It says every penny [not just every nickel; the Senator from Texas is a real conservative] every penny that we collect in Social Security taxes that we don't have to pay Social Security benefits should be dedicated to Social Security, not to any debt caused by other programs in the government. 
   We should not spend it on any other Government programs, nor should we use it for tax cuts. Senator DOMENICI, in a proposal that is enshrined in this budget that we will have to vote on, sets up a lockbox. We will not be able to spend one penny of the Social Security surplus. This is vitally important because, as everybody in the Senate knows [I am quoting Senator GRAMM] and I wish every American knew, our Government has been using every penny of money coming into the Social Security trust fund for other programs. We currently have IOUs for this money.  
   Mr. President, $857 billion, those are the IOUs. So the Senator from Texas and I agree that we have been stealing it. And how do we steal it? We use it to pay down the public debt. How is the debt caused? By tax cuts. 
   So, what goes around comes around. I know the distinguished Senator does not want to join in that because he wants to save every nickel, he says. I will get the Congressional RECORD tomorrow and I hope they do not change it. But the quotation is there: ``Every nickel to be spent for Social Security.'' That is what Senator GRAMM, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and the majority leader said. If you really want to save Social Security rather than spend it, you are going to, by gosh, vote against cloture, continue this debate so people can come to their senses. I can tell you that right now, I do not mind voting against it. You can tell my opposition to it. 
   I will ask the distinguished Senator from Idaho, what about Social Security? I am trying to get sense out of this language here. Fortunately, the 19-page amendment is reduced. As it is described in the handout by the distinguished majority leader, it ``uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt.'' 
   How do you use the Social Security moneys to reduce the debt and yet spend every nickel--or every penny, as Senator GRAMM says--for Social Security? The debt is not caused by Social Security. The debt is caused by anything and everything but Social Security. So, once you use Social Security moneys to pay the debt--I will be glad if somebody will just explain that to me and I will be glad to stop. But I just do not understand how we save Social Security by spending its money on any and every other program--the debt of every other program but Social Security. 
   Would the distinguished Senator want to respond? 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what I want to say, exactly. And I think it is a very sound law and I am not trying to repeal it. I am trying to carry out its intent. That is, we reap those benefits like any other Treasury security. Mr. President, there is not any question we are in a dickens of a fix. The CBO predicts that at the end of 1999 we will owe Social Security $857 billion; in the year 2000, it will be $994 billion that will be owed to Social Security. I want you to get the feel and the picture of exactly what is coming. They are talking like this is the only way to do it. 
   This is the only way to absolutely savage and destroy Social Security. They want to continue to do it formally with this particular amendment, because this amendment, by the year 2001, paying down the public debt with the Social Security surplus, we will owe Social Security $1.139 trillion. Extrapolating it on out, by the year 2007 we will owe Social Security, paying down the public debt, $2.205 trillion; and on the 10th year out, the year 2008, we will owe Social Security $2.417 trillion. 
   There is where we are going to be faced, before we get to the point of the year 2012-2013, where they said the interest costs then are going to have to be consumed and not earned in order to make the payments. And by 2022, we will be totally out of money. By that time it will be about $4 to $5 trillion. But just in the short period, by 2008, they are talking about all of this going up and how we are paying down the public debt over the years, we are increasing the Social Security debt, all under the auspices and policy of saving Social Security. That is what this Senator is trying to ram home. 
   This is not saving Social Security. This is spending Social Security, putting it in a deep hole, totally in the red, and there is nobody in his right mind going to come and start trying to raise taxes for $2.417 trillion. That is the course we are on with this particular amendment. That is why the Senator from South Carolina is exercised. 
   We have several problems. One, of course, is to save Social Security. The way they do it is to continue to pay down the public debt with this particular amendment. It uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the public. That is exactly what we have been doing, and now we want to formalize it. In essence, in paragraph 1 of the amendment, they reaffirm section 13301 saying that you cannot do that, and then in a further paragraph on page 10, they say that is what we can do. 
   I remember, Mr. President, when I was the Governor of South Carolina, we had a contest. We were cleaning up the insurance industry. We had the Capital Life Insurance Company. They were looking for a slogan. We came up with the winning slogan: ``Capital Life will surely pay if the small print on the back don't take it away.'' 
   That is exactly what we have in this amendment. They are trying to say, ``Oh, no, we're not changing the law at all. We have the very same thing. We are doing it exactly the way it has been done over the years.'' 
   This is a long amendment:  
   This title may be cited as the ``Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act.''  
   Then, it cites a finding. In the finding, Mr. President, right in the very beginning, page 3, section 1, it says:

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished 
   Senator from Ohio. He got a lot of heat. But what he was trying to do, like we both did as Governors, is just hold the line and make certain that we can save something. On the figures of the Congressional Budget Office, he said 2001, they said 2006, that there would be an actual surplus and we could then pay down the debt. So I voted for the VOINOVICH amendment, and the distinguished Senator helped me on our amendment. We got 24 and he got even more votes, if I remember. 
   So I congratulate the Senator's sincerity in his endeavor. Let me ask the distinguished Senator the question, when he says the only surplus we have is that of Social Security, that is true, although we have some other surpluses in the military retirement, civil service retirement, and other matters here. But isn't it the fact that the only debt we have is other than Social Security? In other words, Social Security has not caused the Government debt, be it public debt, private debt, or any other kind of debt, because we have been paying off Social Security and enjoying the surplus each year since 1983. Is that not the case? I mean, when you say pay off the debt----

That is why on this chart, I showed it, under CBO we owe Social Security $857 billion. The particular amendment that has been introduced and is now subject to a vote tomorrow does not pay down Social Security's debt. It pays down the public debt, which is any and every other debt than Social Security.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. That said, you could not use Social Security in a unified budget; namely, you could not use it for any spending programs, tax cuts, and everything else. But they ignored it, since it was only a budget law and we did not make it a criminal statute to lock up the Congress or lock up the President of the United States for doing it. 
   It has been totally honored in the disobedience thereof. We have not done it. Now I work with the administrator of Social Security. I want to show this to the distinguished Senator. It is S. 605, and it puts the money over in Treasury. You said you wish we could put it in Fort Knox. I can change that if the distinguished Senator would cosponsor it. We will say put it in Fort Knox, not to be spent for any purpose other than Social Security. It can be done. 
   The dilemma we are in is, section 201 of the original Social Security Act says to use those moneys to buy Treasury bills or Government securities. Don't leave the money, then, with the Government when you buy that security. Count that same amount of money to be transferred back into the Social Security trust fund. Thereby, you have the money and you have also earned the interest each month. 
   That is the way to do it, under the counsel of the Social Security Administration. I have checked it with other lawyers because I had been frustrated. I thought we had a lockbox. Oh, boy, Senator Heinz and I talked about the lockbox back in 1990, and President George Bush, on November 5, signed it into law. That is the law today. That is reiterated in this amendment to S. 557, on page 3:  
   Congress reaffirms its support of the provisions of section 13301.  
   But then on page 10, they spend it. What do they spend it for? For debt. Who caused that debt? All other programs, all programs other than Social Security. Social Security does not cause public debt, it is caused by other programs. That is how they get around the nuance of spending it. 
   What we have, I say to the Senator, is a lockbox that everybody has the key to except one group--the Social Security folks. When you pay down the public debt, you can spend it for everything because that is what causes the public debt. That is why I was a little taken aback--you try to talk politely on the floor, and my distinguished friend from Idaho said he was really worried about the honesty of this thing. You don't want me to get up and holler about the dishonesty, because I know the intent of the distinguished Senator from Michigan who offered it is good. I would not accuse him of being dishonest. But it is inaccurate, I can tell you that. It is totally, totally inaccurate to say that you have a lockbox. It is misleading when you use  the expression ``pay down the public debt.''

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator has the floor. I apologize for interrupting. It says: ``Uses the Social Security Surplus to Reduce the Debt.......'' Then it goes on to say:  
   The surplus could not be used for non-social Security spending or tax cuts.  
   But when you say pay down the debt, that is actually what you are doing, is using the money for non-Social Security spending or maybe a tax cut, but it is not Social Security spending.

<DOCNO>106-hollings-sc-34-19990421</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. We have about $3.6 billion in public debt and about $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion in Government debt. Yes, you reduce the public debt, but you increase the Social Security or Government debt. What happens is the overall debt continues to go up. 
   It is like I explained a little bit earlier about having two credit cards. I have a Visa card and a MasterCard. I want to pay down the public debt with the MasterCard. I said what I will do is use my Visa. So I pay down the MasterCard with the Visa card, but my name is on the Visa card, and I owe just that same amount of money. 
   You can see by paying down the public debt, that is the unified deficit using the trust funds. It has been going down, and even the regular debt has been going down until now. It is going to start back up. The overall debt has been increasing up, up and away. It was less than $1 trillion. 
   This is the cancer you and I worry about, not just the Social Security recipient getting their money, but it was less than $1 trillion when President JOHNSON balanced the budget, and the interest cost was only 16. Now it is $5.7 trillion and interest costs of almost $1 billion a day. That is all for nothing. That is almost $340 billion in increased spending each and every year for absolutely nothing. That is the biggest waste. When you say Government is big, that is the big part.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Actually almost a billion a day. Interest costs are over $363.8 billion a year. So the debt is going up. 
   That is a beautiful little description that Alan Greenspan and the rest give that when you pay down the public debt, the interest costs go down. That is not the fact at all. Interest costs continue to increase. 
   The Senator from Ohio has been very indulgent. He has the floor, and I apologize. I think he and I have the same frustration and the same intent. I advisedly and very seriously and very sincerely say look at this particular entry on page 3. That is exactly what they do, they reaffirm the lockbox, but on page 10 they transfer the money back to the debt, and it is every and any debt but Social Security. It can be spent for any and every amount, and it runs up Social Security and that goes into the national debt and that goes into the interest costs and that continues to increase. That is what has happened. 
   When I was Governor, we had an insurance scandal, and we began to clean up the industry. One of the companies reorganized and said, ``Now we need a new slogan.'' I said, ``Capital Life will surely pay if the small print on the back don't take it away.'' That is exactly what we have here in this amendment. You have it on page 3, the lockbox, and now on page 10, you take it away.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. The reason I do that is the distinguished Senator from Idaho said he was here and voted for the Greenspan Commission report. And the Greenspan Commission report said: Look, as sort of a lockbox, take the Social Security trust funds out of the unified budget.  
   A majority of the members of the National Commission recommends that the operations of the OASI, the DI, HI, and SMI Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget.  
   You see we contemplated back in 1983 the baby boomer problem. And it is now determined to be not a baby boomer problem, but an adult problem on the floor of the National Government right here in the Congress.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in 1999 we have a $126 billion surplus; in 2000, a $137 billion surplus; and then out into the year 2009, a $217 billion surplus. We contemplated that at the time of the enactment of the Greenspan Commission and said we are going to build up, like a good, responsible insurance company, a reserve so that we could take care of demands of the baby boomers in the next generation. 
   If we said, at that particular time, Mr. President, that the money is going do be spent for any and everything, as the Senator from Ohio and I have just been discussing, we would have never voted for the payroll tax. You could not have gotten a vote except to save Social Security at that particular time. And we contemplated a reserve fund. Instead, they got all of these super-duper plans to solve the baby boomer problem; when the truth of the matter is, the big thing to do--and it almost puts it back solvent--is quit looting the Social Security trust fund for debt caused by any and every other program but Social Security. 
   And one final point: The lockbox, in other words, with this particular measure, gives everybody the key but Social Security. When you say, pay down the public debt, you are paying down the debt caused by any and every other program, whether it is entitlement, discretionary or defense. That is the debt. Because it is not Social Security's debt. I wish they would pay down the $857 billion they owe Social Security. 
   But they said, pay down the public debt. That increases the Social Security debt. The debt increases, as shown for the next 5 years by the Congressional Budget Office. The debt increases, interest costs increase. 
   We are getting by now, but if we go back to the regular order of business economically in this country, we are really going to be savaged. And when they say honesty, what really frustrates the people who oppose this amendment is the honesty of it--I don't want to say the dishonesty, but the incorrectness of it. 
   This amendment ought to be withdrawn. It actually continues what we have been doing that got us into this particular fix in formalizing. And they know it is formalizing and dignifying the savaging of the Social Security trust fund. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for his indulgence. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the interesting thing to this Senator, of course, is the date, March 17. Nothing has changed. We knew that the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and his colleagues would be conspiring, as they have delayed us this afternoon to get the exact right conspiracy. To do what? To eliminate President Clinton's budget, on the one hand, and to engage in a charade or fraud, on the other hand, to make the Members, and particularly the media that covers this thing, see the perception is the reality. They are still talking surplus, surplus, surplus, surplus when we pointed out time and time and time again there is no surplus. We are spending $100 billion more than we are taking in. But this is to get everybody to think there is some change. 
   All you have to do is read the distinguished chairman's summary of the Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, summary of amendment, April 20, 1999. This is 1 month later. The distinguished Secretary of the Treasury foresaw this amendment. There is nothing complicated about it except its wording and rewording of the statutory provisions of 13301 and many, many other provisions, to mislead, as if it were really doing something. 
   But, 2, ``Uses Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the public.'' 
   Mr. President, we have been doing that for years and years on end. That is what we call the unified--there it is--the unified deficit. That is when they use the Social Security surplus. We have this chart. We have been using this for years. 
   As a former chairman of the Budget Committee--I speak advisedly, not politically--I have been trying my dead level best to do what the chairman in this amendment proposes to do, but it is the same act, the same scene, because in 1968 President Lyndon Baines Johnson brought about a merging of the Social Security trust fund with general funds of the U.S. Government so we could then talk about a unified deficit with trust funds. Therefore, you could get a surplus rather than a deficit. 
   The truth of the matter is, the trust fund surplus from Social Security is $126 billion. You use Social Security trust funds and you continue to do so. 
   They say pay down the public debt. Let me get into that paying down the public debt, like it is something other than the national debt. I am in my 33rd year, and the real problem is to really try to stop increasing the national debt and to pay down the national debt. 
   When we say pay down the debt, do not give monkeyshines of paying down public debt, thereby increasing Social Security debt. The distinguished Senator from Missouri said just a minute ago, if you inherited money, rather than going off to Las Vegas you ought to pay off your home mortgage. This does not pay off the home mortgage. This does not pay down the national debt. It just levels off and obscures the true size of the national debt, whereby we are thinking we are reducing the public debt and we are paying our bills. Not at all.

<DOCNO>106-hollings-sc-4-19990420</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I will read ``Exclusion'':  
   Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and revenue totals of the old age, survivors and, disability insurance program established under title II of the Social Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.''  
   And it goes on in paragraph (a) saying that the Social Security trust fund  
   ..... shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of the budget of--(1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted by the President, (2) the congressional budget, or (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.  
   Now, true it is, the amendment reiterates that particular section. But that has been in the disabuse, the disavowal, the violation thereof ever since 1990, when President Bush signed it into law on November 5 of that particular year. And this particular amendment continues to put it within the unified by paying it down. 
   Now, that has been the big problem all along. And so at the beginning of the year, when I fortunately began to hear music to my ears that both the White House and congressional leaders on both sides were saying again and again that they were going to save Social Security, I got with my friend Ken Apfel, who used to work for the Budget Committee and is the Administrator of Social Security today, and, as a result, we introduced S. 605, a bill to solidify the off-budget status of the Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Program under title II of the Social Security Act and to protect program assets. Let me read section 5:  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law throughout each month that begins after October 1st, 1999, the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in a secure repository or repositories cash in a total amount equal to the total redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal old age and survivors insurance trust fund and the Federal disability insurance trust fund pursuant to section 201(d) of the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day of such month.  
   Mr. President, that really puts it into a lockbox. It is in the Budget Committee. I have asked the chairman to let us bring it up. I would be delighted to have hearings on it. We would give anything to have a vote on it, but they have filled up the tree so I can't put it in as an amendment here. Maybe we can get it at the end of the so-called cloture vote and put it in when we get an up-or-down vote on this. 
   But section 201(d) requires the Social Security Administration to invest in Treasury bills, Government securities. Necessarily, they get the IOU and the Government gets the money. But if you immediately transfer an equal amount of money back to a trust fund in Treasury, as section 5 requires, then you have the lockbox where the money is only expended for Social Security purposes. 
   Now, this has been drawn with the assistance of the Social Security Administration. And some of my colleagues, when I showed it to them, they said: Wait a minute, that's what you are going to do. What you are going to do with the money is, you do exactly with the money as you did between the years 1935 and 1968 before you started this monkeyshine of a unified budget, spending all of the Social Security trust funds. That is what happens. You keep it right over there and it gets the highest amount permissible by law under T bills today, which this year in interest will be $48 to $50 billion in interest that it earns. 
   This money is supposed to be earning, on the one hand, and kept in trust, those earnings, and the total fund on the other hand. Instead, we are spending the interest and the fund itself. We are breaking Social Security, and coming out here baldfaced and saying we all want to save Social Security, and not one red cent is going to be spent on any other than Social Security. It is one grand fraud. 
   Mr. President, let me just emphasis, since I have the page turned here on public debt and private debt, or gross Federal debt--I am referring to an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2000. I asked CBO, ``What do you really leave out when you call it this public debt? What part of the debt, the overall public and private, or trust fund debt, goes into the national debt?'' This is held by the public. I am referring to page 74, April 1999, the most recent report of the Congressional Budget Office: Debt held by the public is the amount of money that the Federal Government has borrowed by selling securities to finance all of the deficits less any surpluses accumulated over time. Under the CBO's apparent baseline forecast, debt held by the public is estimated to decline from $3.6 trillion in 1999 to $1.2 trillion in 2009. Gross Federal debt consists of debt held by the public and debt issued to Government accounts. 
   Like you issue and you receive in Government accounts, most of the latter type of debt is held by trust funds, the largest of which are Social Security and Federal civilian employee retirement funds. 
   Because Treasury handles investment by trust funds and other Government accounts, purchases and sales of such securities do not flow through the credit markets. Therefore, interest on those securities is considered to be an intragovernmental transfer. 
   That is what I call the monkeyshine when they take from one and give it to the other. You only are talking about the one that you are giving, and you are saying you are reducing the public debt, but you are increasing Social Security debt and saying in the same breath you are saving Social Security when you are looting it, when you are savaging it. You are ruining it. There is no question that is what is going on, and that is what this amendment calls for. 
   Back in 1983, if we had any idea that Social Security trust funds were going to be spent for any other purpose, you would have never passed that tax increase on Social Security, that payroll tax. You would never have been able to get the votes. 
   We all talked and revered ourselves out here on the floor with the flourishes of how we were saving Social Security, that we weren't going to let it get in the red anymore, and how we are going to take care of the baby boomers in the next generation, and that we are not going to have it go bust. Instead, it is not the baby boomers that continue to talk. It is the adults on the floor of the Congress totally in violation of all Government policy. We are going to private corporations. And in 1994 we passed the Pension Reform Act and said there are too many of these takeovers. Well, these fast money artists come in and pay down a good conservative-run company. They pay down the company's debt with the pension fund, and then take all the money and run. We said that is going to have to stop, and we are going make it a felony if you do it. 
   So we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994. 
   Colleagues have heard me tell the story of Denny McLain, because I saw it in the New York Times whereby Mr. McLain, the all-time pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, became the head of a corporation, paid off the debt with the company pension fund, got fired, convicted of a felony, and sentenced to 8 years. Mr. President, if you can find what cell poor Denny is in, tell him next time run for the Senate. Instead of the jail term, he would get the ``Good Government Award.'' 
   We stand out here baldfaced and say how we are saving Social 
   Security when we are spending it on the debt. Don't get all caught up with public debt like they want. That is what they want. They want us to meet ourselves coming around the corner. By the year 2000, next year, we will owe $2 trillion, and by the end of the 5-year budget period, we will owe trust funds--the Government itself--$3 trillion. 
   I can tell you. You couldn't do this in corporate America. We would be all fired as the directors. 
   But that is what happens and what occurs then. Finally, the fiscal cancer  grows in droves. What happens is then it is projected that this year there is $356.3 billion in interest costs. 
   Let me just say a word about that. I see other colleagues here on the floor, who I would be glad to yield to. 
   But I am trying to emphasize again and again that this amendment does nothing more than increase our fiscal cancer. It does not save Social Security. It puts Social Security deeper in the red. That is what happens here when you get the forced spending like taxes for interest costs on the national debt, which is part of the public debt, too, and the debt owed to the trust funds--what they might call if we were a private entity our ``private debt.'' But what happens is, as with Lyndon Johnson, President Johnson, back in 1968 when we last balanced the budget, when the Government last balanced the budget, in 1968-1969 we ended up with a surplus. We didn't use Social Security moneys, incidentally. At that particular time, there were about 200 years of history, and the cost of all the wars from the Revolution on up to World War I, World War II, the cost of Vietnam, Korea, the debt was less than $1 trillion. And the interest cost was only $16 billion--one-sixth--$16 billion. Here, without the cost of a war and the ensuing years, it has gone up to $1.2 trillion. 
   So we have increased spending for nothing, absolutely nothing. This is what I call ``fiscal cancer.'' You put in a sales tax. You get a school. You put in a gas tax. You get a highway. You put in other taxes. You get general government. But you put in this interest tax, for this charade, fraud, maneuver, political maneuver, and the cancer continues to grow. As the amount shows here on its face, for the next 5 years, the interest costs go up. 
   Here we are forced to spend $340 billion more than what President Johnson spent when the budget was last balanced. 
   Mr. President, just think of that $340 billion that I am going to spend this year, next year, next year. In fact, it is going up, up and away in interest costs. This is all under current policy, incidentally. And we have already destroyed current policy by passing an $18 billion military pay bill. 
   We have now, and we are all going to vote for it, I think, $6 billion for Kosovo. We have already busted the caps $21 billion. That is not the case here. This is saying that you have not busted the caps, that you had no Kosovo, that you had not voted $18 billion for the military. But just think of that $340 billion more. I could give $80 billion to paying down Social Security or saving Social Security. I could give $80 billion to pay down the public debt. I could give $80 billion for the Republican tax cut. I could give $80 billion for the Democratic spending programs, for Medicare and otherwise. That is only $320 billion. I would still have $20 billion for a parade and a party. As I promised my distinguished chairman, I would jump off the Capitol dome if he balanced the budget by the year 2002. That was a couple of years ago--or 2001. I am still willing to reiterate that pledge. 
   They are not balancing the budget. We are spending, as you can see, $105.2 billion more than we are taking in, according to CBO this year, and $91.8 billion more than we are taking in for the budget that we are working on for the year 2000. That is what I call fiscal cancer, and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to say: Oh, everything is coming up like roses. It is morning in America, whatever else, any kind of political jargon. But the reality is there. I have a record and I did not just come to this recently. I put in the sales tax, back in 1949 and 1950 for public education in my own State. I got the first triple-A credit rating of a southern State.

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-hollings-sc-2-19990415</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the same act, same scene, under different auspices, different rules and regulations, with the manifest intent, in this particular Senator's opinion, that what is on course here is a Milton Friedman-like plan of the distinguished Senator from Texas to privatize Social Security, to establish private savings accounts. The Republicans do this in violation of all the rules and regulations that you can think of that have been put in over the past several years to bring about fiscal discipline. 
   Let's get right to the point: We, up until now, have been on course with some fiscal discipline. Credit President Clinton and the 1993 Congress that enacted the Balanced Budget Act, which cut spending, increased taxes, increased taxes on Social Security--the very measure that they said was going to end the world and throw us into a depression whereby even the distinguished chairman on the House Budget Committee said he would change parties. I don't know whether he is running today for President as a Democrat or Republican, but to my knowledge Mr. KASICH is still a Republican. He said he would change parties if it worked. It is working. The market is over 10,000, we have housing starts and inflation is down, unemployment is down, and everything else of that kind. 
   When they reported this budget, trying to continue the fiscal discipline, here is the language:  
   In addition to the fiscal policies contained in the budget resolution, I also am troubled by the process the Republican majority wants to use in this year's budget. The reconciliation process have been used sparingly in the past to improve the fiscal health of the budget. It was created to give the Senate a process for making difficult fiscal decisions--decisions that often require cutting popular programs and increasing taxes to balance the budget. 
   That is not the case this year. The Republicans want to use the reconciliation process to dramatically reduce revenues over the next ten years and impair the progress we have made so far in reducing the deficit and beginning to pay down the debt. 
   The budget resolution also would modify the pay-go point of order. Pay-go was required to insure the Senate would provide off-sets to reduce taxes or increase spending. The modified budget resolution now will make it possible to cut taxes without a fiscal off-set. By making it easier to use future surpluses to cut taxes instead of paying down the debt, this will eliminate the fiscal discipline that has reduced the deficit and contribute to the fiscal cancer eating away at America.  
   I say cancer, and I say that advisedly, because when President Johnson last balanced the budget, the interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Today it is just about $1 billion a day. The last estimate of the Congressional Budget Office was $357 billion each year. When President Johnson last balanced the budget, after 200 years of history--the cost of all the wars from the Revolution on up, World War I, World War II, the cost of Vietnam, Korea--the interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Now, since that time, without the cost of a war--we made money on Desert Storm--so, without the cost of a war it is now $1 billion a day, eating away. With that wasted money, the interest cost on the debt, I could give the distinguished Presiding Officer his $80 billion tax cut, I could give our Democratic friends our $80 billion in increased spending, I could give $80 billion to save Social Security, I could give $80 billion to pay down the debt--that is only $320 billion. But we are going to spend at least $357 billion this year on nothing, and if interest costs start going back up we will be to $500 billion. 
   But, to the original point, read this conference report. Here are the shenanigans that go along and are given dignity by my distinguished colleague  from Texas saying it is the finest budget he's seen. I was sorry to see him do that because I joined him in passing Gramm-Rudman-Hollings for fiscal discipline, and this is the most undisciplined shenanigan that you will ever find. 
   On page 18, section 202 of the conference report:  
   Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill, or an amendment thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon is submitted that enhances retirement security through structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on the Budget may--

   Mr. HOLLINGS. It is an old insurance game. I remember that when I was Governor, we were trying to clean up the insurance industry in my State. A new company was looking for a slogan, and we finally came up with the winning slogan: ``Capital Life will surely pay, if the small print on the back don't take it away.'' 
   Now we have it all the way up here 35 years later in the budgetary process of the U.S. Government.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to draw my colleagues' attention to an opinion piece in today's Washington Post on air safety. The article, titled ``Yes to Air Safety'' by Congressman SHUSTER, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, talks about the critical need to fully fund our air traffic control system and to build our nation's airports. It is a simple proposition that is being put to Congress--if you take money from airline passengers, you must use that money to build and sustain the system. 
   We all leave here every weekend, journeying across the country. Each of us encounters delays at Reagan National. Right now, the FAA operates the safest air transportation system in the world. Maintaining this high standard requires money--plain and simple. We can underfund the agency and we can take the airline passenger money and give people a tax cut. If we do this, then we can not complain about delays--it is our fault for the shortchange. If we take the Trust Fund money and use it for a tax cut or other purposes, it is our fault, not Jane Garvey or Rodney Slater's, but ours alone. 
   We have an opportunity to restore the ``Trust'' in the Airport and Airways Trust Fund, and to give to our constituents what they need and have paid for--a safe, and efficient air transportation system. We should not let it pass us by. Congressman SHUSTER has got it right. 
   Here are the facts: 
   From Fiscal Year (FY) 1982 through 1999, Congress appropriated more than $27 billion for the modernization program. FAA estimates that the effort will need an additional $14 billion for FY 2000-2004. The FAA requested $2.3 billion for FY 2000, which represents an increase of 11 percent over the FY 1999 appropriation level of $2.1 billion. But it is not enough to fully modernize the national air system (NAS).  
   Accident rates for the U.S. air transportation system, compared to other areas of the world or other modes of transportation, all indicate that the U.S. aviation system remains the safest in the world. For example, aircraft hull loss rates for the U.S. and Canada are 0.5 per million departures, compared to 3.8 per million for Asia and the Pacific islands. For 1998, there were no commercial passenger fatalities within the U.S. 
   As the FAA aviation forecast information, released just a few weeks ago, indicates, there will be almost 1 billion passengers (up from 607 million in 1998) and an increase in the total number of flights from 65 million to about 82 million by 2010. Today, the FAA, in many instances, is using outdated equipment that must be replaced in order to meet the expected demand. 
   In 1997, the Congressionally created National Civil Aviation Review Commission (NCARC) found that gridlock in the skies is a certainty in the near future unless the ATC system is modernized. According to the report, an increase in delays of just a few minutes per flight would seriously inhibit the ability of carriers to operate hub and spoke systems. I must note that one DOT study suggests that adding 48 more flights at Reagan National would create approximately 3 to 4 minute more delays per aircraft. This report was further supported by an American Airlines study detailing how a four minute increase in delays would seriously impact the ability of carriers to operate hubs. The FAA estimates that if demand increases as expected, no new runways are added to major airports, and no advances are made in air traffic control, then 15 of the U.S.'s major airports will be severely congested by 2006. In January 1997, the White House Commission on Aviation Security and Safety recommended that we expedite the modernization of the ATC system and complete the project by 2005, ten years earlier than originally planned. 
   If we do manage to fix the air traffic control system to make it more efficient, we still need to have more runways and terminals to accommodate the expected growth. Again, it is simple, if one has too many planes trying to land on one runway, one will have delays. Runways do not come cheap. The runway in Seattle, which we agree is sorely needed, will cost more than $830 million. A new runway in Atlanta, Chicago, or Dallas likewise will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Without that added capacity, delays will increase. We know this. No one disputes this. It gets back to money--we have a Trust Fund which will have $79 billion by 2008 just sitting there. The General Accounting Office has also told us of the looming funding crises for airports. We simply can not ignore our duty--we can not use that $79 billion for anything other than funding our air transportation system.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we just heard the word ``surplus.'' We have seen a lot of charts. But the truth of the matter is that we are spending $100 billion more than we are taking in this year. And the Congressional Budget Office projects that we will spend $89.9 billion or $90 billion more next year just under current policy, in the face of that current policy, taking care of inflation. 
   We hear all kinds of ``visions of sugar plums dancing in their heads'' on this floor. We have turned the Senate Chamber into a recording studio for campaign 2000. And everybody is saying, ``Well, $2 billion more for the veterans and $8 billion more for the farmers, and $15 billion more for the military pay, and so much more for education. And, by the way, we ought to have a tax cut. But remember, we have spending caps, and we have to stay within the caps.'' They know, of course, that we exceeded the caps last year by $12 billion and this year by $21 billion. So already we have exceeded the caps by $33 billion, plus the $18 billion that we voted for the military pay. We ought to be looking for $50 billion to make up for this, but we are adding on all of these fanciful figures. 
   So what we really ought to do is bring a note of reality, a note of what the situation actually is, to the debate and get a budget that we can vote on. 
   Here is the lead editorial of USA Today. And I quote it:  
   If your member of Congress comes home this weekend bragging about having adopted a responsible federal budget for the coming year, don't you believe it. 
   The $1.7 trillion spending and tax outlines being muscled through the House and Senate this week are little more than the budgetary equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes [or the emperor had no clothes]: Behind the self-congratulatory hype there's a lot of nothing--and the real possibility of another political train wreck later in the year.  
   Mr. President, this amendment is offered in order to avoid that train wreck. And how do we do it? We do it as Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, said: ``Do nothing.'' 
   I thought it was very interesting: in the Banking and Housing Committee we had the ranking member, Senator SARBANES of Maryland, in a discourse with Mr. Greenspan. 
   Quoting Senator SARBANES near the end of the questioning: ``So it seems to me for this whole host of reasons I agree with what I understand to be your position; that is, of all the alternatives the one you rate first and foremost by a significant margin would 
   be to use the surplus to pay down the debt.'' 
   Greenspan: ``That is correct, Senator.'' 
   SARBANES: ``Yes, I--how do you save that surplus? You know, how do you keep it from getting spent, I guess is the question?'' 
   Greenspan: ``What happens is that you do nothing.'' 
   Namely, you freeze this budget with respect to the current policy. You take this year's budget for next year, you program it out, and you get to a real surplus in the year 2006. Thereupon, Mr. President, that is the real surplus; and thereupon, we will direct that surplus--if it materializes--to paying down the debt, and we will give everybody a real tax cut, because the interest rates will go down. And they will save all the mortgage homeowners--the automobile payments, the refrigerator payments, the washing machine payments. Everybody in credit-card America will get a real tax cut. 
   The point is that we have been playing the game of paying down the debt that is not understood really by the American people in that we have been using Social Security to pay down the debt for the last 15 years. 
   What we do is, we just take the Social Security credit card and look over  here to what they call public debt or the Wall Street credit card and pay off that debt to the payers with the credit from Social Security; and you just up the debt on Social Security. You still owe the same. It is like taking a Visa card and paying down your MasterCard; and, of course, your Visa card goes up. That gamesmanship, Mr. President, has been going on, to the point that we have fiscal cancer.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   What has happened really is we have caused the debt in Social Security. This minute, Social Security is in the red $730 billion. Next year it will be in the red $867 billion. And by the year 2009, we will owe $2.6 trillion to Social Security. 
   Now, if we hold the line--staying the course; the economy is good; inflation is down; unemployment is down--if we stay the course, it is a responsible budget and we can maintain the good economy here in America. 
   I thank the distinguished Chair.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this continues current policy and uses the surplus moneys to pay down the debt. This amendment by Senator BOB KERREY and myself uses what surplus there is over the budget period to pay down the debt. 
   Members might say, Was this not the amendment of Senator VOINOVICH which we voted on? Senator VOINOVICH uses Chairman DOMENICI's mark; I use the mark of the Congressional Budget Office. 
   We call this the Greenspan amendment because Senator SARBANES was questioning the record of the Federal Reserve. He said, How do you save that surplus? How do you keep it from getting spent? Mr. Greenspan said, ``What happens is, you do nothing.'' In other words, you take this year's budget, we are doing fine. We have growth, low unemployment, low inflation rate, and truly pay down the debt. 
   All of these others talk about it, but there is so much spending and tax cuts, you will never get any debt paid down. This, when it is paid down, will lower the interest costs which will get everybody a real tax cut.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, for some time, many aspects of the U.S.-China relationship have concerned me. Since China's entrance into the WTO will be the most significant U.S.-China negotiation in the next several years, the contentious U.S.-China issues should be moving toward resolution before the conclusion of any agreement. Unfortunately, that is not currently the case. Most relevant to the WTO process is the exploding US-China trade deficit. In 1998, it reached a record $56.9 billion dollars. In fact, U.S. export to both Singapore ($15.6 billion) and Holland ($19 billion) were greater than exports to China ($14.2 billion). At the beginning of the decade, the deficit was a problematic but manageable $12.5 billion. Conversely, our large trading partners (the Europeans and Japan) have managed to maintain a relative trade balance with there Chinese counterparts. In fact, all of China's trade surplus is accounted for by the enormous imbalance with the United States. 
   Moreover, the continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations, espionage and possible technology transfers suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter the WTO. Recently, the State Department released its annual human rights report concluding that the situation in China has degraded significantly over the past year. Additionally, we remain troubled by the allegations regarding the possible illegal transfer of technology to China, as well as lingering questions over Chinese espionage and involvement in U.S. elections. Any trade agreement with China would be premature before these issues are resolved. 
   Although none of these concerns are new, the Administration's efforts to resolve these issues have been unfortunately unsuccessful. Regretably, in fact, the pace of the China WTO negotiations appears to have increased. As a result, we believe that this legislation is both appropriate and timely. Congress must review any agreement, and all of the surrounding negotiations to ensure that it reflects traditional American values while protecting American interest.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I remember the day when we had truth in budgeting. I will never forget when we promulgated in 1985, almost 15 years ago, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. At that time, we realized that Reaganomics was going up and away with respect to the growth of the debt and the accelerated interest costs upon that debt, not just necessarily the growth of the economy. 
   We got together on a bipartisan basis and, under the auspices of truth in budgeting, we came to the floor, and even though we had opposition on both sides early on--President Reagan opposed it, certainly over here the majority leader, the whip, and the chairman of the Budget Committee opposed it--on this side of the aisle, on 14 up-or-down votes, we got a majority of the Democrats on the basis of truth in budgeting. 
   Fifteen years later, we have gone to fraud in budgeting. It is all a political exercise that will bring us later in the year to what one might call a Mexican standoff. Then both sides will probably get together, hopefully, and, since the media will be covering them and they are moving into an election, do some saving of Social Security or at least some paying down of the debt. But I have a bill today, Mr. President, that actually requires us to save Social Security. 
   Let me mention that, once the government receives the moneys from the payroll tax under section 201 of the Social Security Act, it immediately buys special securities, 30-year T-bills. With those 30-year T-bills, of course, Social Security has the bond, or the IOU, the Government has the money, and obviously they have been spending that money for either increased spending or for tax cuts, but not for any paying down of the debt. The debt continues to go up. 
   Under section 201 in that particular instance, it is like having two credit cards. You have a Visa card and a MasterCard, and you want to pay off your MasterCard with your Visa card. So you pay down the public debt. Herein, let's say the Visa card is Social Security and the MasterCard is the public debt or Wall Street credit card. That is the crowd that does not want the sharp elbows of Government coming in and crowding out finance, running up interest costs and disturbing corporate finance. 
   When you take the Social Security credit card to pay down public debt, it is simply a transaction of increasing your Social Security debt. At the present time, the deficit in Social Security is some $730 billion in the red. 
   Mr. President, we did not intend that in 1983. In 1983, what we did was say: We are going to put in an inordinately high payroll tax in order to build up a surplus to take care of the baby boomers in the next generation. 
   That is exactly what we are not doing. We are crowding around on the floor saying, ``Beware, beware, beware, the baby boomers, baby boomers.'' It is not the baby boomers, it is the adults on the floor of the Senate looting the fund if we keep the money in, as was intended in section 201 of the Social Security Act. 
   As Mr. Greenspan said, take Social Security outside the unified budget, do not have any unified budget and growth deficit, just have the national debt and the national deficit, one accounting, not two sets of books. That is what we called for. We 
   wrote it into law under President Bush in November 1990. It is constantly disobeyed and is being disobeyed with the two budget proposals of the President and the Republicans now. 
   President Clinton's budget came to us. And I call it a fraud because everyone else has called it a fraud. What it did was say we are going to hedge a way against this so-called tax cut move on the Republican side politically, so we are going to save Social Security, we are going to take care of Medicare, and pay down the debt. They mean public debt. They know they can easily do that with the Social Security money. 
   Incidentally, we had a motion on President Clinton's budget in the Budget Committee, so I speak advisedly. The record will show it did not get a single vote, Democratic or Republican, for that President's budget. 
   Along comes the Republican budget, and you can see exactly what is going on. They are meeting with the candidate for President, Mr. KASICH, who knows better. He is the one, incidentally--I do not know if he is running as a Democrat or a Republican--he said if the 1993 tax increase and spending cut and paring down the size of Government, corporate downsizing, Government downsizing some 300,000--he said if this thing works, ``I will change parties.'' I have not seen the distinguished Congressman recently, but I am waiting to, because I am going to ask him how he is running, as a Republican or Democrat. He promised to change parties and become a Democrat if it worked. It is working. 
   The Republican budget comes in now and they say, ``We have to do better. We have the House and Senate. We  want to take over the White House, so we want to give them a tax cut.'' 
   How do they do it? With a fraudulent budget. They go up and above, and my distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the Senate side, the Senator from New Mexico, knows better. I have worked with him. We are the two original members since 1974 of the budget process and the Budget Committee. 
   He comes in and he adds on almost $800 billion to the debt. In addition to adding to the debt, he comes around and says now, ``We are going to direct in reconciliation that the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Finance Committee itself, come out with a tax cut.'' This is an absolute adulteration and fraud of the budget process. We intended--and it is right in the reconciliation provisions--that if you get to the end of the road--and you are always slightly over--you can increase some revenues here, there, or yonder, or you can cut some spending here, there, or yonder. You reconcile spending and revenue so you do what you say and say what you do to balance items in the budget. 
   Instead, now the Republicans are going to use reconciliation to cut the revenues. Here we are spending $100 billion more this fiscal year 1999 than we are taking in. Under current policy, it would be $90 billion more, but you can see already with this particular monkey shine in the face of reality, there is no chance of a tax cut and having a real budget. We have already come in with caps. 
   Last year we exceeded the caps by $12 billion. We exceed the caps $21 billion this year. Then we come and pass an $18 billion increase for military pay. That is $50 billion we ought to be looking for in either increased revenues or spending cuts. Rather, the wonderful Budget Committee, on a partisan basis--the Republican budget is a fraud--comes forward and says, Here it is--and we are amending the reconciliation in this particular process--and sends it to the floor directing the Finance Committee--and the chairman of the Finance Committee, incidentally, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, said: If we do not have a tax cut, it would be highway robbery. We've got money sloshing around up here. 
   Unfortunately, they also repeal the pay-go rule. This means they will not need an off-set to pay for their tax cut. When we debate the budget this week, the Republicans are going to ram it through the Senate--10 hours, 10 hours, and 10 hours. They can get it through in three days and back up all the roll calls. And they already have it greased on the Republican side to send it through. Instead of a Budget Committee exercising its responsibility to promote fiscal responsibility, this budget here is a fraud and promotes irresponsibility. 
   To those who say, Mr. President, what are you going to do if you pass the Hollings bill that sets aside the money in Social Security? It does not just sit there; it earns the highest amount allowed by law, just as it did for 33 years--from 1935 until 1968. The Social Security trust fund was sound. That is a requirement for all corporate endeavors, in that we make it a felony if you try to pay down the company debt with the pension fund. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer, he heard me speak of Denny McLain the other afternoon. So I keep harping on it. Here we say in corporate America, if you engage in that kind of nefarious activity, it is a felony, and off you go to jail. But here you get the ``Good Government Award.'' It is totally fraudulent what is going on. Neither side is giving. Both sides are out of reality and they are going merrily down the road as they are with the census, with no reconciliation. But be that as it may, there isn't any question that we can pay down the debt under current policy if we just stay the course. 
   That was my motion in the Budget Committee. You say, ``All that big talk, HOLLINGS. What then would you do?'' Look at the particular budget we have. Look at the economy we have. If you were the mayor of a city, if you were the Governor of a State, you would immediately say, ``Well, let's stay the course. We don't want to let go of the firemen or the policemen. We don't want to start any new endeavors right now. Let's keep this economy growing.'' 
   All we have to do, as Mr. Greenspan finally testified, is do nothing, just hold the line, generally speaking, taking this year's budget for next year. By 2006, by that time, above Social Security surpluses, we would have regular surpluses, true surpluses. And that money could be used to pay down the debt. 
   I am not for the gamesmanship about public debt and the interest costs going down. That is a story out of the whole cloth. That is not going to happen. Right now, we owe $730 billion to Social Security. By the year 2013, we will owe Social Security $3 trillion--$3 trillion. 
   We are supposed to have, under the Greenspan Commission report and law as it now stands, $3 trillion in the bank. I know my distinguished friend from North Dakota is waiting to come here, but I want to make sure we understand the fiscal cancer this country has. 
   When Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, we only had to pay $16 billion in interest costs on the national debt--today, we pay $357 billion each year--almost $1 billion each day. And the interest costs go up, just like the price of energy and gas is going up now, as indicated in the morning paper. If those little interest costs go up, it will be over a billion dollars a day. 
   With the money we would save in interest costs on the national 
   debt, I could give my Republican friends an $80 billion tax cut. I could give my Democratic friends $80 billion in increased spending. I could give Social Security $80 billion. I could give paying down the debt $80 billion. That is only $320 billion. We are going to spend that each year--next year and more. This country has fiscal cancer. That is the state of the Union. And in the best of times that we are all enjoying now, if we cannot get some kind of discipline in reality out of the process here in the Congress, I do not know how we are ever going to save it. 
   I thank the distinguished Chair and yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on tomorrow afternoon, we begin to mark up the budget. That is, when I say we, I mean that the Budget Committee on the Senate side meets to mark up the budget for the year 2000 commencing October 1 this year, and immediately we will hear the cry, ``Surplus.'' 
   I am constrained to say--as in the earliest days of the Republic when Patrick Henry said, ``Peace, Peace, everywhere men cry peace,'' and there was no peace--``surplus, surplus, everywhere men cry surplus,'' but there is no surplus. 
   The fact is that we are spending $100 billion more than we are taking in already this fiscal year, and under current policy the deficit for next year will be right at $90 billion. 
   Also, Mr. President, another thing to note is the fact that you are going to hear the cry, ``Saving Social Security.'' I can tell you categorically that neither the Republican plan, policy or approach nor the Democratic White House plan, policy or approach will save Social Security. Both spend 100 percent of the Social Security moneys coming in the fiscal year 2000, as is the case already this year. And otherwise, all the wonderful talk about paying down the debt is nothing more than fancy rhetoric for a flawed policy that has got us into a situation of fiscal cancer. 
   Now let me go right to the meaning of ``Surplus.'' Yes, we are making progress on the budget and the deficit. At a news conference earlier today I was asked about this and when did we ever expect to get some results. Well, I see that we are beginning to understand that there is no surplus. Most of the nation's astute commentators on the budget see this, too. Allan Sloan of Newsweek said, of course, that the President's plan was double accounting. Paul Samuelson talks about when they said ``surplus,'' it was ``surplus in the sky.'' The Concord Coalition, made up of our former colleagues, Senators Rudman and Nunn, with whom I have had an on-going engagement, finally says there is no surplus. And only two weeks ago Barron's, the conservative financial newspaper--which I hold it here--said: ``Hey, Guys, There is no Budget Surplus.'' 
   But be that as it may, the White House and many members of Congress are going to start dealing around the so-called surplus, nonexistent that it is, for education, Medicare, tax cuts, anything and everything--everything but saving Social Security. It has been a constant charade on messages of the party caucuses on both sides since January, even during the impeachment days; we have got to get our message out. Unfortunately, most of the media falls right in line with the message. They don't look into the actual fact or the reality. 
   On the matter of the so-called surplus and the $100 billion that we are spending now: mind you me, Mr. President, we set spending caps year before last, and last year we broke the caps by $12 billion, and we have already broken the cap in this year's budget by $21 billion, which would mean in marking up 2000's budget we would immediately have to cut spending $33 billion to conform to the fiscal year 2000 budget cap. 
   Instead of doing that, we have already met in unison, almost like a chorus singing ``Whoopee for the military,'' and we have spent $18 billion on the military, money which is unaccounted for. Instead of cutting back, the Senate has already exceeded the agreed-to caps by $18 billion. Unless, of course, they intend to cut $18 billion in domestic programs or cut $18 billion in operation, maintenance and readiness within the defense budget. 
   We are going in the wrong direction. No one should think that Social Security has a surplus. This fiscal year, we have a surplus of the amount required to be paid out, but since we have been spending it each year there is a $730 billion deficit due and owing. Social Security is in the red. 
   So there are no surpluses. Even trying to get around that to try to get something to politic on for this year and next year, the Campaign 2000, they say, ``Well, wait a minute; we will start our tax cuts in the year 2002 when there is one document to the effect there might be a slight surplus in Social Security, over and above the Social Security amount or otherwise we can spend it on Medicare beginning in 2000''--anything for the Campaign 2000. 
   They talk in the Chamber about the Chinese. Come, come, come. It is not the Chinese. It is not the baby boomers in the next generation. It is the adults in Congress who are looting the Social Security trust fund. Each one of these particular plans spends 100 percent of the Social Security so-called surplus. 
   How do I say that? Well, it is easy. You go back into the original law--and I have a copy of the law itself--section 201.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will send that momentarily to the desk, section 201 of the Social Security Act. Under section 201 of Social Security, we required at this moment--and have been doing so for years--under law to invest only and immediately in T-bills, Treasury bills, these special securities of the Federal Government. Once we do that, of course, we get a bond or IOU; the Government gets the money, and immediately all of those moneys are transferred to the Government account and it is spent, allocated, or used to pay down the so-called public debt. 
   The one way to stop that is a bill, which I will send to the desk and for which I request proper referral. Mr. President, this bill simply says, amongst other things--and I will read section 5--that:  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, throughout each month that begins after October 1, 1999, the Secretary of Treasury shall maintain, in a secure repository or repositories, cash in a total amount equal to the total redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund pursuant to section 201(d) of the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day of each month.  
   Advisedly, Mr. President, this was worked out by none other than my Social Security friends. At one time, I had the distinction of being the chairman of the Budget Committee. We had an outstanding staffer then named Ken Apfel. He is now the Social Security Administrator. I called over there and I said: Let's stop this roundabout dance  about surpluses and spending all the money and everything else; I want you to write a provision whereby we can do exactly what we said when Congress passed the Social Security Act. 
   Remember old John Mitchell, under the Nixon administration? He said, ``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' I am afraid on budget matters we have arrived exactly at that point. But, in any event, to do what we say, we have prepared this bill and now it has been introduced and, if passed by the Congress, yes, we will save Social Security. 
   Immediately, one of the distinguished Senators said, ``Wait a minute. Is the money going to just sit there?'' 
   No. Mr. President, that money will be invested in T-bills, just as it has been all these years. Or, if there is an additional plan, like the Kerrey-Moynihan plan, like our Thrift Savings Plan--a certain percentage invested in the market in order to make more money but take on more risk--we can debate that. What this particular bill really does is save Social Security. Social Security funds will not be spent, save and excepting on Social Security purposes. 
   This is exactly what was intended by Mr. Greenspan when he headed the Greenspan Commission in 1983. In 1983, section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report said to take Social Security outside of the unified budget, outside of the unified deficit, and set it aside in trust. I struggled from 1983 until 1990 to translate Chairman Greenspan's recommendations into law. I thought we had done it in 1990, when we passed the Budget Act by a vote of 98 Senators here on the floor of the Senate and almost an equal majority, overwhelming as it was, over on the House side. President Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed the bill into law, including section 13301 of the Budget Act, which stated Congress could not spend Social Security moneys on anything other than the Social Security program; you had it outside of the unified budget and the deficit. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, that has been ignored. That is why I have to reword it this way. But the contemplation at the particular time, the law itself, the policy of the U.S. Government with respect to corporate America--we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994 saying: Thou shalt not, in corporate America, spend your pension fund to pay off the company debt. 
   The most interesting and ironic thing is, when Denny McLain, the former great pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, became the head of a corporation and paid off its debt with the pension fund, he was sent to jail for 8 years. If you can find what jail poor Denny is in, say to him, ``Denny, next time, run for the U.S. Senate. Instead of a jail term, they will give you the good government award.'' 
   That is exactly what we are doing. We violate our own policy. We pay off the debt with the Social Security Trust Fund and have been doing it for 15 years. 
   That gets me immediately to the point of so-called paying off the public debt. You know, they have these euphemisms and different expressions that come around budget time and make you think you have a real policy on board. That has been the policy. 
   Admittedly, if you had a stagnant economy, if you had a dormant stock market, you could welcome paying off the public debt to get the economy and the stock market moving and everything else. But to do it, not over just a year or 2, but to do it for the last 15 years to the tune of in excess of $100 billion, what it has really done is given us fiscal cancer. We have gone up, up, and away with the national debt, and the interest costs are killing us. 
   Let me dwell a minute on the interest costs on the national debt. The interest cost, when President Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, was $16 billion. Today the interest cost is projected to be $357 billion, almost a billion dollars a day. What it says to me is, this year I have to spend--and next year I have to spend--$357 billion for nothing. If I had been fiscally prudent, I could have had $80 billion for tax cuts plus $80 billion for spending increases plus $80 billion to pay down the debt plus $80 billion to save Social Security. That is $320 billion. I would have had $37 billion for you to have a party out here on the west front when I jump off the Capitol dome. 
   Since 1995, I have been telling Chairman DOMENICI, trying to bring sense to this entire budget debate by talking in the extreme, that by the year 2002, if he had a balanced budget, truly balanced--if we were paying out less than what we were bringing in or just at that amount--I would jump off the Capitol dome. And I reiterate the pledge. Let's make the bets--``Get old HOLLINGS to jump off the dome.'' Because under current policies, no one can possibly balance the budget while exceeding revenue by over $100 billion. Nobody is cutting $100 billion. They are spending $18 billion more unaccounted for, breaking the caps. Nobody is spending less than $90 billion. So we know with all of this spending for tax cuts, Medicare, education, housing, and everything else of that kind, that we are in deep trouble. 
   We have fiscal cancer. What we really should do, probably, as Mr. Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, finally came around to saying, is do nothing: take this year's budget for next year. I did that as the Governor of South Carolina. I capped the debt. By the way, that would bring truth in budgeting to this crowd, if they are right. Let's plead guilty: They are right, I am wrong, there is a surplus and we are going to pay down the debt. If that occurs, we can cap the debt as of October 1 of this year, the beginning of the next fiscal year. Whatever it is, since there is a surplus and since we are going to pay down the debt, let's cap it so it does not exceed that particular amount. 
   You cannot get the White House--I faced them down in one of these briefings--to go along with it. I will make the motion and we will see how many people vote for that. 
   I am trying to bring truth to our federal budget. I am trying to avoid the fiscal cancer. The Republicans talk about an $80 billion across-the-board tax cut. I want a $357 billion tax cut this year, next year, and right along the line. I want, in that 10-year period, $3.5 trillion in tax cuts, not just this $800 billion tax cut. I want to get rid of this waste in Government. 
   I served on the Grace Commission to Eliminate Waste. I know what waste is. I speak advisedly. Before long, if those interest rates go up, instead of $357 billion, we will be up around $500 billion in interest costs. It is the largest item in the domestic budget for spending at this minute. 
   What we ought to do is get a hold of ourselves, start talking sense to each other, work out a plan to take care of the needs of Government, but quit using the Social Security surplus and trust fund as a political slush fund for any and every idea on the media message. And the media are going along with this nonsense and act like we actually are doing it. My particular bill will bring sobriety to the entire process and debate.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday this body paid tribute to one of the greatest men to serve in Congress in the twentieth century, Morris ``Mo'' Udall from Arizona. Yesterday, I was proud to sign the resolution honoring him, and I would like to pay tribute to him now. 
   Mo Udall was a giant. For thirty years, he straddled politics in Arizona and America. He was a statesman as well as a legislator, and an intellectual as well as a politician. Although Mo believed passionately in many causes and was a Democrat through and through, his wit and warmth helped him forge many productive, bipartisan relationships with his colleagues across the aisle. Mo's intelligence, commitment, and personal touch helped him create a legislative legacy that still shines bright today, almost forty years since he entered the House of Representatives. 
   As everyone who follows public affairs knows, Mo Udall hailed from a family with a rich tradition in politics and public service. His ancestors were pioneers who helped transform the Arizona Territory into a great state. Mo entered Congress after winning a special election in 1961 to replace his brother, Stewart, whom President Kennedy had tapped to head the Department of the Interior. 
   Today, the Udall name continues to resonate in Congress. Mo's son, MARK, and his nephew, TOM, both were elected to the House in 1998. I know they will carry on the great tradition of public service and Congressional achievement set by their fathers. 
   Mo was such a modest and easy-going man that one sometimes overlooks the enormity of his legislative record. After rising to the chairmanship of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, a position he held until his retirement in 1991, Mo wrote much of the nation's most important environmental legislation. He pushed through important regulations concerning land, water, mineral, and timber use. Mo also helped reform America's postal system and our campaign finance laws, and he was instrumental in reforming the seniority system in Congress. 
   In addition to being a great legislator, Mo Udall was a great man. He bridged divisions and always sought to bring people together to work for the good of the country. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I believe Mo's wit and self-deprecating manner were largely responsible for his successes. Perhaps the best way to illustrate his humor is to relate a joke he loved to tell about one of his campaign visits to New Hampshire during his 1996 Presidential race. At one stop, Mo approached a group of men to tell them he was running for President, only to be told, ``Yes, we were just laughing about that.'' 
   Mr. President, if ever a public servant deserved to be taken seriously, it was Mo Udall. It is a sign of his stature as a man that despite his many accomplishments, he never took himself too seriously. 
   Today I am honored to pay my respects to my friend Mo Udall, whose legacy of public service and bipartisan achievement will be remembered for many lifetimes.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Administration's 1999 Reauthorization bill at the request of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. I introduce it so that it can be part of the debates on the future of our aviation system. There are many provisions that I do not support and the Secretary understands this. However, the FAA needs adequate funding.  The money is in the Airport and Airways Trust Fund--we just need to unlock it. 
   The items which concern me include the PFC and doing away with the High Density Rule and fees. Furthermore, I take issue with the Performance Based Organization though I recognize that many segments of the industry support it. We will not privatize the ATC System, but we must make sure FAA has the tools and money to do its job. 
   I intend to work with the Secretary and Senators MCCAIN, ROCKEFELLER, and GORTON to accomplish this common goal.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today it is my great privilege and honor to salute one of South Carolina's foremost jurists and public servants, South Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Ernest A. Finney. 
   On February 23, Chief Justice Finney announced he would retire from the Court after 14 years. This is a bittersweet day for my state. All of us who admire Judge Finney and appreciate his legacy are sorry to see him leave the bench; but we also are happy for Judge Finney if he has decided it is time to take a richly deserved rest from the rigorous demands of public service--demands he has shouldered over five decades. 
   When Ernest Finney graduated from law school in 1954, blacks were not allowed to join the South Carolina bar or serve on juries. Judge Finney worked as hard as anyone in the country to change that. One of only a handful of black lawyers in South Carolina in the 1950s, he began his legal career as an advocate for equal rights and desegregation. 
   Ernest Finney and his law partner, Matthew Perry, who went on to become the first black federal Judge in South Carolina, tirelessly represented over 6,000 defendants arrested during civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. Although they lost all the cases at the state level, they won almost all of them on appeal in federal courts. 
   After helping lead the fight to desegregate South Carolina, Ernest Finney turned his attention to another form of public service. In 1973, he became one of the first blacks elected to the South Carolina House in this century. He served until 1976, during which time he founded the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus. 
   From 1976 to 1985, Judge Finney sat on the South Carolina Circuit Court bench. Always the pioneer, he was the first black Circuit Court judge in South Carolina. 
   In 1985, he became the first black member of the state Supreme Court since Reconstruction. He served with great distinction as an Associate Justice and earned respect and accolades from his peers and from attorneys appearing before the Court. 
   In 1994, Judge Finney was elected Chief Justice, the first black South Carolinian to attain that position. Without a doubt, he is one of the finest jurists in South Carolina history. As senior Associate Justice Jean Toal commented on the announcement of Judge Finney's retirement: ``He's a giant of the judicial system in South Carolina. His tenure will be remembered as one of the outstanding tenures of the modern system.'' 
   Mr. President, today it is my immense pleasure to salute the gigantic achievements of Judge Ernest Finney, one of the most estimable public servants in recent South Carolina history. I join his friends and admirers in wishing him well as he begins his retirement, during which I suspect he will continue influencing South Carolina for the better.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, I shall vote with a clear conscience not to convict; rather, to acquit. And I have no better authority, of course, than my own Congressman, the manager, LINDSEY GRAHAM, when asked--and I will never forget it--by the Senators from North Carolina and Wisconsin: ``Under the law and the facts as then submitted at the end of the presentation, could reasonable people find  differently with respect to guilt?'' and Congressman GRAHAM said, ``Why, of course,'' that reasonable people could differ. And when the manager says there is reasonable doubt, that ends the case. 
   But let's remember that the impeachment clause is not intended to punish the President, but to protect the Republic. And the mistake in this entire presentation on both sides, in my judgment, has been that they have been trying a criminal case rather than a political case. What is really for the good of the country? I go to the understanding of the impeachment clause with respect to the author himself, George Mason, who said, ``must be guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors against the State.'' And Justice Story, in the midcentury, said that you could only impeach a President for conduct that only the President could engage in.'' 
   I will never forget, when they gave us the booklet, in the Nixon impeachment, by the eminent professor of constitutional law, Charles Black, he said that ``an impeachable offense must constitute a deep wrong to the country, an abuse of Presidential power.'' And everybody is talking about the polls and I think they are significant. When 80 percent of the people believe the President lied, and I believe he did--not on the perjury charge, and not on the obstruction of justice, of course, but I believe he lied--and 80 percent of the people believe he lied, but 70 percent of the people said keep him there. Why? Because there wasn't a deep wrong to the country. 
   Let's get to it. Fooling around--that was what Monica Lewinsky called it--seen as sex and not, fooling around is not a crime. In fact, actual intercourse constitutes adultery, a crime which the managers, I would say, are very familiar with. 
   We must remember that the fooling around was between consenting adults, both of them sexually experienced. Incidentally, in private both of them are admitted liars. The President said he lied. Monica said that she grew up lying, was taught to lie. 
   But the managers said, ``Oh, this isn't about sex, this is about crime.'' Really? I have been at the law too long. A sues B for the crime of adultery, sexual misconduct. A and B both swear under oath and through their pleadings and their testimony and not before a halfway grand jury. I always wondered, what if prosecutors went under oath before a grand jury? We would have to build new courthouses. But be that as it may, they swear under oath in testimony before the judge who is trying the case on its merits, and A or B loses--whoever the loser--are they taken over to criminal court and charged for lying under oath and obstruction of justice? 
   I called a prosecutor in Congressman GRAHAM's district, an 18-year experienced prosecutor, a Republican, George Duckworth. I said, ``George, have you ever taken lying under oath and obstruction of justice for sexual misconduct--have you ever taken that to criminal court?'' He said, ``It's never happened.'' 
   I then went to the chief of all the State prosecutors, John Justice, who happens to be from my State, and he said he had never heard of it. 
   So we are beginning to get to really what is going on, and that is not to say, whoopee, everybody lies about sex and we can go ahead and do that. We are not saying that at all, because the President can be charged with it, as anybody can. It might be a rare case, but we ought to remember, rather than that one witness that they found--and I guess they will find another one--but the Republican district attorneys who testified on the House side, the deputy attorney general in charge of the Criminal Division, William Weld, they said they would never bring the case. 
   This case never should have been brought. Any respectable prosecutor would have been embarrassed actually to so charge. 
   I will never forget when this commenced, David Pryor, the Senator from Arkansas almost 4 years ago, said: Wait a minute, 41 TDY FBI agents coming from one side of Arkansas to the other, 81 support personnel, asking, ``Did you ever sleep with Bill Clinton? Do you know anybody who slept with him? I heard you know. We're going to take you before the grand jury.'' Locking up witnesses who did not testify to what they wanted attested to, paying off others and securing them and hiding the witnesses, and on and on; and thereafter subpoenaing the mother in tears; the Secret Service, the White House steward, the bookstore; some 4 1/2, 5 years and $50 million. And they come up with private sexual misconduct, in privacy. I know it is a public office. It is a public office, but we operate in private in our own offices. To make this thing public after all of that expense and effort, I would be embarrassed as a prosecutor to bring it. 
   But not Kenneth Starr. He wasn't embarrassed. He should never have taken it. A member of the Kirkland & Ellis law firm that had an interest in the case, the Jones case, was participating at the time. Instead of recusing himself, he immediately started pursuing that case with the official hand of Government. 
   Three years ago, seven former independent prosecutors expressed dismay at Starr's ethics. He was representing private clients inimical to the defendant, our President. The New York Times and other newspapers editorialized that he ought to step aside. But instead of removing himself, he continued to talk to political groups, all the time leaking information and, yes, holding up his findings after 4 1/2 years until after the election and saying he found nothing with respect to Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, or any of the other cases for which he was commissioned--no embarrassment at all. 
   He injected himself so in the House proceedings to where finally his ethics advisor, Sam Dash--who, of course, had been the principal participant in Watergate--had to resign. Then he injected himself over here on the Senate side, and last weekend, during a key moment, of course, he said he was going to bring a criminal indictment. He leaked that information. 
   So now we have the Justice Department investigating the independent prosecutor for his misconduct in the way he treated the main witness with respect to her access to counsel. And you have an 8-to-1 vote in the American Bar Association, which has been inserted; they say let this independent prosecutor thing die. 
   Yes, we have, like Bryant said, broad overreaching of power. Not by Clinton. He got into an elicit affair, and he tried like everybody else to cover it up. They sought to characterize it as lying, lying, lying, lying under oath. We had the chief of the managers; he lied not just from January till August, but 30 years --and others over there. The hypocrisy of that crowd. 
   Yes, we had broad overreaching of powers, mindful, of course, of the reason that we declared our independence 223 years ago--``sending hither swarms of officers to harass our people and seek out their substance.'' We have it now, and we have a chance to try it. We have an impeachment case, but we are trying to impeach the wrong person. That is why the American people are as concerned as they are. That is what you find in the polls that we keep talking about. 
   Let's understand, of course, that President Clinton debased the Office of the Presidency, but let's say once and for all that we are not going to have the political hijacking of the Office of the Presidency. Let's be certain when we vote this week that we don't debase the Constitution.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I believe it would be helpful for all of us to consider the example of bipartisan cooperation and collegiality set by many of our predecessors. Jack Valenti, a former advisor to President Lyndon Johnson and a man many of us know personally, nicely captured that spirit in a recent editorial, published in the Los Angeles Times, urging a return to ``political civility.'' 
   There was a time, Mr. President, when leaders of both parties, men like President Johnson and Everett Dirksen, knew the importance of maintaining cordial relations and cooperating to further the national interest. As Jack Valenti puts it, ``they knew that compromise was not an ignoble word.'' 
   In today's atmosphere, I fear that cooperating on anything for the good of the country will prove extremely difficult. In this trying time, we all should consider Jack Valenti's words, as well as the spirit of the bygone era he invokes. 
   At this time, Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Valenti's editorial be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator STEVENS and Senator DODD: George Santayana stated, ``Those who disregard the lessons of history are bound to repeat them.'' The United States Senate is too politically charged and it would be more so were it not for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, ROBERT C. BYRD. A couple of weeks ago the Senate was about to go over the precipice of partisanship. Fortunately, we agreed to have an off-the-record session of all Senators. That alone would not have prevented our reckless course, but it did give all Senators an opportunity to hear Senator BYRD at his finest hour. He commenced by thanking Senator DANIEL AKAKA for leading us in prayer, harkening the time Benjamin Franklin took to the floor of the Continental Convention to call on divine guidance for cooperation and bipartisanship. Then Senator BYRD continued to calm partisan zeal and give us all a sense of historic perspective. We started talking sense instead of politics. It got us together. We could have gone the way of the House, but Senator BYRD is the one who put us on the right path. In appreciation for his leadership, we think the country could benefit by reading Senator BYRD's comments. I ask that the full text of Senator BYRD's remarks be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President: As the 106th Congress begins, we have to address unfinished business first. As many Senators know, the vitally important legislation to reauthorize the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) passed in September by a vote of 92-1. For a variety of reasons negotiations between the House and Senate unfortunately resulted in only a 6-month extension, expiring at the end of March of this year. 
   The bill being introduced today is an effort to reauthorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration for two years. In today's global economy, adequate airport facilities are a critical component of any economic development program. The FAA's Airport Improvement Program plays a central role in ensuring that communities have adequate airport facilities. For FY 1998, the FAA received $1.9 billion. For FY 1999, the FAA would have received $1.95 billion. Instead, the agency will receive only half of that amount, unless we pass either a short term bill or a long term extension of the program. One course we know can work quickly. The other course is more challenging. 
   While it is critically important that we work together to pass this vital legislation, I do want to raise an issue of fundamental importance. That is truth in budgeting. I have supported taking trust funds out of the unified Federal budget for many years. This year, there may be an opportunity to actually make it happen. What is good for highways is good for aviation. At the end of FY 1998, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund uncommitted surplus was $4.339 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is projected to rise to $13.419 billion by the end of FY 2000 and to $79.325 billion by FY 2008. We are collecting the taxes, but are not giving people what they expect, what they paid for, or what they deserve. 
   We know that the FAA needs money to buy new computers and to use satellite technology. We can take it from the existing revenues, while continuing the general fund contribution, or we can limp along, giving the FAA a portion of what we all know it needs. If we do that there are consequences, and the fault is ours, not the agency's. It is that simple. 
   There are difficult problems facing the 106th Congress. Our constituents are demanding reasonable fares. Competition can work well to give us reasonable fares, but it has also created unfortunate anomalies. Look around the country--in the 1980's, the Department of Transportation approved every single merger that was proposed. Now we have a consolidated industry, with the big 3 air carriers accounting for nearly 55-60% of the market, and the Northwest-Continental alliance accounting for another 16-17%. 
   Over the years, I have asked the General Accounting Office to look at fares at small and medium hubs, places like Charleston, S.C. They reported that fares were in fact higher, on average at Charleston, at Greenville, and many other small communities. Last week, the Department of Transportation reported that Charleston had the 5th highest air fares in the country. I did not realize we were 5th, a dubious honor, but I knew they were high. We have a deregulated air transportation system, dependent upon mega-carriers for service, and beholden to them on fares. Without a hub system aggregating traffic, small communities would not receive the service they do today. Yet, the same ability allows the carriers to place the small towns at their mercy. Our economy and ability to grow, to attract new businesses, are now highly dependent upon those same carriers. A low cost carrier may come into a market, cause a ripple in lowering the fares, and then be driven out. We had that with Air South. Getting service to one of the four slot-controlled airports, while important for that route, will not result in lower air fares for the rest of the markets. The average may drop overall, but the statistics do not then tell the real story. Determining how we address this problem will be difficult, but it must be done. 
   There also are a number of issues important to aviation employees and others that must be addressed as we move through the legislative process. For example, issues involving foreign repair stations must be examined, and the bill includes a task force to address this issue. FAA employees must once again be granted access to the Merit System Protection Board and a Universal Access System must be authorized. Whistle-blower protection is another important issue. I look forward to working with Chairman MCCAIN, Chairman GORTON, and Ranking Member ROCKEFELLER toward meeting these objectives and ensuring that our final product is a bill that enjoys the broad support of the aviation community. 
   The comprehensive bill I am co-sponsoring today may not be completed for many months, and we may have to pass a short term extension to make sure that the money for airports does not get tied up. Nevertheless, I know that the Chairman is anxious to get us all moving, so let the debate begin and let us move forward expeditiously in order to fund these critically important programs.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Board (Board). As I have said many times before, the Board performs a vital role regulating the interests of our railroad and other surface transportation industries. Under the able and forward-looking leadership of Linda Morgan, the Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for many years, the Board with its small staff has put out more work, and higher quality work, than much larger agencies. Most significantly, unlike many other agencies, the Board is not afraid to tackle the hard issues, and to put out decisions that are fair, well-reasoned, and independent of political expediency. For example, the Board's unprecedented and focused actions in handling the recent rail service crisis in the West provided the appropriate mix of government intervention and private-sector initiative. 
   More recently, at the end of 1998, at the request of Chairman MCCAIN and Senator HUTCHISON, the Board reviewed rail competition and issued several decisions in controversial cases, and made several recommendations to Congress, that reflect a balanced and comprehensive view of the transportation industry and the fundamental issues that confront it. The Board recently released its findings. In rendering these decisions, the Board, which is accountable to Congress, has acted responsibly and has provided a valuable service in resolving issues within its jurisdiction such as the determination of market dominance, and in raising others, such as open access, more appropriately addressed by Congress. 
   As anyone who has read the comprehensive letter from Chairman MORGAN to Senators MCCAIN and HUTCHISON reporting on the Board's rail access and competition proceeding knows, the Board has acted creatively, aggressively, and decisively in tackling hard issues within its jurisdiction, and in making suggestions to Congress as to how to address remaining issues of contention between railroads and their shippers, and between railroads and their employees. One of its decisions finalized rules that for the first time provide various specific avenues for relief in cases of localized poor rail service, and another decision took steps to facilitate the review of rail rate reasonableness cases by eliminating certain evidentiary thresholds. 
   Linda Morgan as Board Chairman pressed the railroad industry to be more directly accountable to the needs of their customers, and has requested them to reach out directly to their shippers and employees. This has allowed the railroads to reach more 
   settlements with their customers and employees than they have in many years. I commend the Board for initiating government action that results in private sector settlements. Ultimately this sort of settlement has greater chance of realistic dispute resolution. Congress should feel fortunate to have an agency with the competence and credibility to move issues forward in such a positive direction. 
   Because we need the Board, and because the Board has done a fine job, I am here today supporting the introduction of a reauthorization bill. I know that some tough legislative issues regarding transportation regulation may come our way this session, and I look forward to working with the Board and my colleagues on those matters. Whatever the resolution of those matters, we need the stability and continuity in addressing these issues that reauthorization legislation for the Board will provide. 
   The Board, working with the law we gave it, has done its job. I want to thank the Board in general, and Chairman Morgan in particular, who has my unqualified support, for a job well done. The Board has been confronted with some of the most difficult and fundamental issues to challenge rail transportation in many years. The agency has met these issues head on with forthrightness and resolve, taking into account the interests of all parties. However, I am concerned for the Board's future; the Board has not had the opportunity to bring in new personnel to replace personnel that will be of retirement age. It is incumbent on us that we provide this agency the necessary resources to adequately train new personnel, and prepare them to address the rail and other surface issues of the future. 
   I think that much credit is due the Board for facilitating more private-sector dialogue, initiative, and resolution than has ever been undertaken before, and for raising and tackling issues in ways that have never been undertaken before. Once again, I commend the Board on a job well done. The Nation needs agencies like the Board, and I enthusiastically support the reauthorization bill.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator ROBB to introduce the Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1999. This Congress, I hope the Senate will finally dispense with political gamesmanship and enact a true line item veto. It is past time to restore responsibility to federal spending by granting the President the power to strike wasteful and unnecessary items from our budget. 
   The bill we are introducing today is a ``separate enrollment'' line item veto. It provides that each spending or tax provision be enrolled as a separate bill, allowing the President to either sign or veto each of these smaller bills in accordance with the veto power expressly granted under Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution. This legislation is designed to allow the President to strike spending or tax items from the budget without violating the delicate separation of powers which exists under our Constitution. In contrast, the so-called ``enhanced rescission'' line item veto--enacted in 1996 and struck down by the Supreme Court on June 25, 1998--represented a shift in the separation of powers. Under that approach, the President had the authority to sign a bill into law, then strike individual provisions and require a Congressional supermajority to override these rescissions. In doing so, the President was clearly performing a legislative function granted exclusively to Congress by the Constitution. 
   When the Supreme Court announced its decision striking down the 1996 line item veto, the White House and many in Congress clamored in the media about how disappointed they were. The truth is that no one was really surprised. In fact, many Senators--including myself--made statements in 1996 and voted against the bill because it was unconstitutional. The events surrounding the enactment of the 1996 law clearly show that politics was placed before policy. In 1995 our separate enrollment approach had received bipartisan support in the Senate, with 69 Senators voting for the measure. The ``enhanced rescission'' approach, on the other hand, received only 45 votes when considered in 1993, with several Senators raising constitutional objections during the debate. However, in an apparent attempt to put off meaningful reform in favor of Presidential politics, the ``enhanced rescission'' bill was resurrected in 1996 in an effort to score political points. Now, we have come full circle after the Court's decision. It is time to get serious and enact the same bill which received 69 votes in 1995. 
   Mr. President, I am no stranger to this issue. As Governor of South Carolina, I saw first hand how effective the line item veto can be. I used it to cut millions of dollars in wasteful spending from the state budget, and in the process helped earn South Carolina the first AAA credit rating in the state's history. The Governors of 43 states now possess line item veto authority. I have been trying for years to bring this same approach to Washington. I have introduced or co-sponsored a separate enrollment line-item veto in every Congress since 1985. In that year, I co-sponsored Senator Mack Mattingly's separate enrollment bill, which received 58 votes in the Senate. In 1990, I offered a similar bill in the Senate Budget Committee, which passed the line item veto for the first time in history by a bipartisan vote of 13-6. In 1993, after Senator Bradley came on board, we were again able to get a majority of 53 votes. Then, in 1995, support for the bill reached an all-time high when the bill finally passed the Senate with 69 votes. 
   One needs to look no further than last year's end of the session debacle to see the need for the line item veto. Nearly an entire year's worth of legislation--including eight of the thirteen normal appropriations bills, an emergency spending bill, and a tax ``extenders'' bill--was wrapped into a monstrosity entitled the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The time period between the drafting of the bill and its enactment was so short that Senators made statements on the floor that they did not even know the contents of the bill. Unfortunately, this type of omnibus appropriations has become common in recent years, and it prevents an obvious opportunity for abuse. Wasteful spending and tax items are included in these huge, hastily drafted bills, and the President is faced with a ``take it or leave it'' proposition. With the session winding down, he often is forced to ``take it,'' including items which are totally without merit. The line item veto would prevent this type of waste and irresponsibility by allowing each item to be considered separately. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this line item veto bill with the same bi-partisan support it received in 1995 so that we may finally restore responsibility to our federal budget process.

   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem with which we are all too familiar: the ever-increasing cost of political campaigns. Sadly, this cost can be counted not only in millions of dollars but also in lost credibility. Each election year, our political system and we as representatives lose the invaluable and irreplaceable trust of the American people. 
   The enormous amount of money required to wage a political campaign today has given rise to the pervasive belief that our elections--indeed, even we ourselves--are up for sale to the highest bidder. Though this is not the reality, the fact that it is the perception is almost as damning. 
   It is time to strike a blow against the anything-goes fundraising and spending encouraged by both political parties. The need to limit campaign expenditures is more urgent than ever: the total cost of Congressional campaigns skyrocketed from $446 million in 1990 to over $620 million in 1996. This represents a 71-percent increase in just six years. Although fundraising slowed in the election cycle just ended, candidates for general election in 1998 still spent over $10 million more than their counterparts in 1996. 
   Make no mistake: this lull is a temporary one. Experts attribute the slowed spending last year to the unusually large number of uncompetitive elections. I know this is true because in my state, which was the setting for highly competitive elections for my Senate seat as well as the governorship and other state offices, candidates spent record amounts and made 1998 the most expensive election year in South Carolina history. In fact, although the total cost of all Congressional elections increased only slightly this year, candidates for Senate office spent over 15 percent more than their counterparts in 1996. 
   We can be sure that in 2000, election spending will skyrocket to new, astounding levels. And we can be equally sure that this will add to the public's already overwhelming cynicism about its representatives and to the problem of corruption, or at least its appearance in our political system. 
   At best, the obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. At worst, it corrupts and degrades the entire political process. Fundraisers used to be arranged so they don't conflict with the Senate schedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to accommodate fundraisers. 
   All this is the result of the rising costs of political campaigns. Ironically, campaign expenditures have risen dramatically, far exceeding inflation, since Congress attempted campaign finance reform in 1974. Even greater than the increases in aggregate campaign costs were those for average winning candidates--the most useful measure of the real costs of running for office. The average cost for a winning House candidate rose from $87,000 in 1976 to over $640,000 in 1998. For a victorious Senate candidate, the cost of victory rose from $609,000 to $4.4 million last year. 
   I remember Senator Richard Russell used to say, ``They give you a six year term in this U.S. Senate: two years to be a statesman, the next two years to be a politician, and the last two 
   years to be a demagogue.'' Regrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We proceed straight to demagoguery after an election because of the imperatives of raising money. 
   The public demands the system be cleaned up. But how? For years, Senator SPECTER and I have introduced a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to set reasonable campaign expenditure limits. Today Senator SPECTER and I will reintroduce our amendment to empower Congress and the States to limit campaign spending as they see fit. I believe a constitutional amendment is the only way to fix the system; yet since 1976, Congress has failed to adopt one. It has opted instead for a series of half-hearted, piece-meal solutions, with predictable results. 
   For nearly a quarter of a century, Congress has tired to tackle runaway campaign spending through statutory means. Again and again, Congress has failed. Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance reform efforts, which have bogged down in partisanship as Democrats and Republicans each have tried to gore the other's sacred cows. 
   The most recent statutory attempt to reform our tangled campaign system was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. Although I supported this legislation and will do so again this year, I have grave doubts about its ability to effectively reform our tangled campaign finance system. I fear McCain-Feingold never will be enacted, and that even if it passes, it will not withstand the Supreme Court's scrutiny. 
   Since 1976, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it will not uphold any law that limits the money political candidates can spend to win office. The most recent example of the Court's position, as well as of the obstacles local and state officials attempting reform face in their courts, came last November, when the Supreme Court refused to entertain an appeal from the City of Cincinnati involving an ordinance that limited the amount city council candidates could spend trying to get elected. That ordinance had been struck down by a lower federal court as unconstitutional. So you see, Mr. President, no statutory legislation--at the federal, state, or local level--is going to succeed at cleaning up our political system because no such legislation will pass constitutional muster. 
   The framework for today's campaign finance system was erected back in 1974, when Congress responded to public outrage over the Watergate scandals and the disturbing money trails from the 1972 Presidential election by passing, on a bipartisan basis, a comprehensive campaign finance law. I was here in 1974, and I was proud to support the Federal Election Campaign Act. The centerpiece of this reform was a limitation on campaign expenditures. Congress recognized that spending limits were the only rational alternative to a system that essentially awards office to the highest bidder. 
   Unfortunately, in 1976 the Supreme Court overturned these spending limits in its infamous Buckley versus Valeo decision. The Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to spend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the face of spirited dissents, the Court drew a tortuous distinction between campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. The Court concluded that limiting an individual's campaign contributions was a justifiable abridgment of the First Amendment, on the grounds that ``the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption outweighs considerations of free speech.'' 
   Yet the Court also concluded, in a dichotomous and confusing decision, that the state's interest in preventing corruption and its appearance did not justify limiting a candidate's total expenditures. This, the Court ruled, constituted an unacceptable infringement on candidates' speech. 
   I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--does not justify limits on campaign spending. The Court committed a grave error by striking down spending limits as a threat to free speech. The fact is, imposing spending limits in federal campaigns would help restore the free  speech that has been eroded by the Buckley decision. 
   As Professor Gerald G. Ashdown wrote in the New England Law Review, amending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign expenditures is ``the most theoretically attractive of the approaches to reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in Buckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance atmosphere.'' Adds Professor Ashdown: ``If Congress could constitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, candidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the troubles ..... would be eliminated.'' 
   Let us be done with the hollow charge that spending limits are 
   somehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White pointed out in his dissent from the majority's Buckley opinion, both contribution limits and spending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of political speech in general. 
   The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on campaign contributions but struck down restrictions on how much candidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical reality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I have $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of speech. By failing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear unwilling to speak up in his own defense. 
   Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent to Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, Justice Marshall said, ``It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant head start.'' 
   Indeed, Justice Marshall went further. He argued that by upholding the limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall spending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal wealth. Justice Marshall was dead right. The Buckley decision has been a boon to wealthy candidates, who can flood the airwaves and drown out their opponents' voices. 
   Make no mistake: political speech is not free. A political candidate's ability to disseminate his ideas and speak to the voters depends entirely on his finances. Thus, candidates who are personally wealthy or possess large campaign coffers have a tremendous advantage over poorer candidates--they always will enjoy more speech. The amendment Senator SPECTER and I propose today will help level the playing field between rich and poor candidates and ensure that all enjoy equal speech. 
   Believe me, Mr. President, I am not enunciating any radical view today. The Court itself equated money with speech in its Buckley decision. Of course, the Court--and critics of this amendment--adheres to the belief that limiting candidate expenditures is a violation of the First Amendment. Yet the Court rules in 1976 that there exist compelling interests--in this case, the need to prevent the appearance and reality of corruption--to justify the state in circumscribing protected speech. All this amendment does is apply the Court's rationale to candidates' speech. 
   Buckley's nullification of spending limits has helped give rise to American's belief that political offices are up for sale to the highest bidder and has curtailed public discourse. By rendering spending limits impossible it has fueled the escalating costs of campaigns and forced politicians to focus more and more on fundraising and less on important public issues. Our urgent task is to right the injustice of Buckley versus Valeo by empowering Congress to limit campaign spending. 
   My proposed constitutional amendment would accomplish this. It does not proscribe specific cures for what ails our campaign finance system. Instead, it would provide Congress the authority to reform the system by limiting candidate spending. 
   To a distressing degree today, elections are determined not in the political marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections are supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate into megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of corporations and special interests. 
   Mr. President, campaign spending must be brought under control. The constitutional amendment I have proposed would permit Congress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal campaign expenditures. 
   Such a reform would have four important effects. It would end the mindless pursuits of enormous campaign war chests. Also, it would free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and allow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, we wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep our seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And finally, it would create a more level playing field for all candidates. 
   Before concluding, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on the advantages of a constitutional amendment such as I propose over statutory attempts to reform the campaign system. Recent history amply demonstrates the practicality and viability of this constitutional route. It is not coincidence that the six most-recent amendments to the Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. These are profound issues which go to the heart 
   of our democracy; it is entirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional amendment. 
   And let's not be distracted by the argument that amending the constitution will take too long. Take too long? We have been dithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970s, and we haven't advanced the ball a single yard. It has been a quarter of a century, and no legislative solution has done the job. 
   Excluding the unusual case of the Twenty-seventh Amendment, which required over 200 years to be ratified, the last five constitutional amendments took an average of only 17 months to be adopted. There is no reason why we cannot pass this joint resolution, submit it to the States for a vote, and ratify the amendment in time for it to govern the 2000 elections. Indeed, this approach could prove more expeditious than the alternative statutory approach. This joint resolution, once passed by the Congress, will go directly to the States for ratification. Once ratified, it will become the law of the land and will not be subject to veto or Supreme Court challenge. 
   Furthermore, I anticipate and reject the argument that if we were to pass and ratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to hammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure limits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that in 1974, and we can certainly do it again. 
   Mr. President, this amendment will address the campaign finance mess directly, decisively, and conclusively. The Supreme Court has chosen to ignore the overwhelmingly detrimental effects of money in today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it elucidated a vague and inconsistent definition of free speech. In its place, I urge passage of this amendment. Let us ensure equal freedom of expression for all who seek Federal office.

    Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I want to call attention to a brave and selfless deed by a heroic young man from Hanahan, South Carolina. On August 6, 15-year-old Keith Putnam sacrificed his own life to save two women  and a small child from a speeding train. 
   When Keith saw Maurica Hovey, her 3-year-old son John, and her friend Layonee Phillips stuck in the path of an oncoming train, he did what all of us hope we would have the courage to do in such a situation: he leapt from his truck and raced to aid those in danger. After saving Maurica, John, and Layonee, Keith returned to the abandoned car to make sure no one was left inside. At the moment he approached the car, the onrushing train slammed into it, sending it careening into Keith and fatally wounding him. Thanks to Keith's quick thinking and heroic action, all three of the people he saved from the train escaped without harm. 
   Mr. President, I have seen many heroic acts in my lifetime, in World War II and in peacetime, but I don't believe I have ever seen a young man who has been more respected by his community than Keith Putnam. In every way, he was a model citizen. Just before his death, Keith had been made an usher at Peace Lutheran Church, which he attended every Sunday. A great patriot, Keith was dedicated to his country as well as his neighbors. In fact, he planned to attend my alma mater, The Citadel, and then serve as a pilot in the Air Force. 
   Perhaps what was most noteworthy about Keith, especially in this day and age, was his willingness to help his neighbors and even total strangers without ever thinking of himself or asking for anything in return. Keith was committed to public service through large and small acts, whether helping strangers carry groceries to their cars or saving them from a fatal train collision. Since his death, his community has seen an incredible outpouring of emotion, as his neighbors, friends, and family express their grief at the loss of such an admirable and caring young man. 
   Today, Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to theirs. It was not my privilege to know Keith Putnam personally, but his heroism and generosity are an inspiration and an example to us all. I hope the tremendous admiration everyone felt for Keith, and the knowledge that their son's life was exemplary in every way possible, will be of some comfort to Keith's family in their trying time of grief.
