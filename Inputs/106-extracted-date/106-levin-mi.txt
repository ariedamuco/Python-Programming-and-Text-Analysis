   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it saddens me to note that the Senate will soon lose one of its most visionary and accomplished members, a great American, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   It boggles the mind just to think of all of the important positions that PAT MOYNIHAN has held, including cabinet or subcabinet posts under four presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. He served as Ambassador to India in the 1970's and then as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. He came to the United States Senate in 1977 already a scholar, author and public official of great distinction and renown. In the 24 years he has spend here, he has only greatly expanded his enormous reputation and body of work. PAT MOYNIHAN is a Senator's Senator. Over the years, he has earned the respect of every member of the Senate.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as this session of Congress ends, Senator SLADE GORTON of Washington will leave the Senate. Senator GORTON has long been a leader among the Republicans and a thoughful voice in the Senate. 
   Senator GORTON, a hard-worker, has served not only on the Senate Approriations Committee, where he chairs the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, but on the Budget Committee, the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Indian Affairs Committee. He has carried an impressive workload. 
   In addition, SLADE GORTON, a former Attorney General in the State of Washington, earned a reputation as a tough proponent of fighting violent crime, particularly international terrorism. 
   While proud of his conservative credentials, SLADE GORTON was often willing to reach across party lines to work with Democrats on issues like consumer affairs and an increase in the minimum wage . 
   I admired SLADE GORTON's work along with Senator Joe LIEBERMAN to fashion a sensible, balanced and expeditious way to consider the impeachment resolution sent to the Senate by the House of Representatives in 1998. While the plan was ultimately not adopted by the Senate, the careful and judicious effort to put such a plan forward reflected SLADE's commitment to the dignity of the United States Senate. 
   As this year winds to an end, I know that I am joined by my colleagues in the Senate in wishing SLADE GORTON and his wife, Sally, their three children and seven grandchildren, the very best in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in bidding good wishes and God speed to Senator WILLIAM ROTH, the distinguished senior senator of Delaware. I have served with Senator ROTH for most of my career on the Governmental Affairs Committee. For a significant period of that time, Senator ROTH chaired that committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
   Senator ROTH proved an able and dedicated advocate of government reform, guiding our committee through oversight hearings and investigations into how our Federal programs were or were not working. He also spearheaded a number of key efforts--many of which were successful--to change our laws to reduce opportunities for waste, fraud and abuse. 
   When I sat in my seat on the dais of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I often heard Senator ROTH argue passionately and convincingly for the enhancement of the M, or management responsibilities, in OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. As much as anyone in this body, Senator ROTH truly cared about the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs. He has my deep respect and the gratitude of all of us for his efforts in this area. 
   In addition, Senator ROTH distinguished himself as a gentleman in a chamber that has sometimes lost its gentlemanly manner. Senator ROTH could be tough, there's no doubt about that, on issues about which he cared, as well he should be, but he was always civil. 
   We will miss his gentlemanly ways and his guiding hand on the important but not-always-so-visible issues of government management. I wish him well and hope he enjoys an active but less hectic life which he so clearly deserves.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to a colleague and good friend who will be leaving the Senate when the 106th Congress adjourns sine die, CONNIE MACK, the junior senator from Florida. 
   I have served with CONNIE MACK on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence where, on the important issues of national security it considers, he can be counted upon to set partisanship aside, roll up his sleeves and get to work. 
   In the United States Senate we are called upon to work with colleagues of many differing points of view. While CONNIE MACK has served as a key member of the Republican leadership as Republican Conference Chairman, and he and I often disagree on the issues before the Senate, it has always been a pleasure to deal with him. Always an  able advocate for his point of view, he is a willing listener, open to compromise and when an opponent, always gracious, reasonable and fair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we conclude the 107th Congress, we will be saying goodbye to our colleague and friend, Senator JOHN ASHCROFT of Missouri. 
   A former two-term Governor, JOHN ASHCROFT has earned a reputation in the Senate for his principled pursuit of conservative issues. He is also recognized as a strong proponent of the wide use of the internet by federal agencies as a way to make the government more responsive and accountable. As a leader in the term-limits movement, he carried out the innovative online petition drive. 
   Senator ASHCROFT served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the Commerce and Judiciary Committees. He established himself as a leader among Republicans on a range of issues from term limits to tax reform and welfare reform. While in many instances I have found myself on the opposite side of issues from John, I have always respected his intellect, his integrity, his principled positions and his ability to disagree without being disagreeable. 
   Since 1995, JOHN ASHCROFT and I have co-chaired the Senate Auto Caucus. In this capacity, we have worked together to provide Senators with up to date information on issues affecting the automotive industry and its employees. Through the Auto Caucus we organized informational briefings to give Senators and their staff and opportunity to better understand the auto industry's remarkable progress as well as the challenges it faces. The Caucus provides a forum for Senators to exchange ideas on issues affecting the industry such as transportation, environment, trade, technology and health care. 
   Working together with Senator ASHCROFT's, we were able to increase membership in the Auto Caucus from six Senators to twenty-eight. The Auto Caucus played a leadership role in pressing the Administration to negotiate market opening trade agreements with Japan and Korea in the automotive sector and continues to weigh in on and monitor those agreements. In addition, the Caucus hosts meetings between Senators and Automotive CEOs, provides timely briefings on US-Japan and US-Korea automotive trade negotiations, and encourages the Administration to fight to open markets to U.S. vehicles and auto parts. 
   Last year, Senator ASHCROFT and I worked together to urge the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to use an unbelted 25 mph barrier test instead of a 30 mph test to design air bags that will help better protect children, teenagers and small adults. Our work on this very complicated and controversial issue brought the Administration and Auto industry together to reach a result that will increase automobile safety. 
   We also worked together to continue the moratorium on unfair and ineffective increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and worked toward a compromise in the Senate to ensure that a National Academy of Sciences study of the effectiveness and impacts of CAFE standards will include the effect of those standards on motor vehicle safety as well as discriminatory impacts of those standards on the U.S. auto industry. 
   Also, we have worked together in the past to ensure that environmental regulations recognize and reinforce the voluntary environmental improvements and technological achievements of the automobile industry. 
   Not only will JOHN's contribution be missed in debate on the Senate floor, but his voice will be sorely missed, I suspect, by the ``Singing Senators'', the wonderful quartet in which he has joined with Senators LOTT, CRAIG and JEFFORDS. My wife and family, join me in wishing the best in the years ahead for JOHN, his loving wife (and co-author), Janet, and their family.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as this session of Congress comes to an end, I want to speak about my friend and colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator ROD GRAMS. 
   A former television news personality, ROD GRAMS, in his term in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, quickly established himself as a proponent of assistance to farmers and as an advocate for the establishment of a national nuclear waste repository. 
   As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he has been an  opponent of international agricultural sanctions and a strong supporter of vigorous foreign trade. He supported IMF funding, trade with China and review of the U.S.-Cuba relationship. 
   He joined the bipartisan effort to enact strong brownfields cleanup legislation. ROD GRAMS earned a reputation as a strong supporter of tax relief, favoring elimination of the marriage penalty and other tax cut proposals. 
   While ROD GRAMS and I have disagreed on a number of issues, I respect the commitment which he has brought to policy debate. Where we disagreed, I found ROD GRAMS to be a straight-talking and agreeable adversary. I wish him and his family well in the future.

The bill also included important new legislation, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act [DATA], which I authored along with Senator HATCH, working with our colleagues Senators BIDEN and MOYNIHAN. It will make a revolutionary difference in the way in which we battle heroin and other opiate addiction.

   Mr. LEVIN. In other words, it is our intent that with respect to the amendments to the Controlled Substances  Act made by the provisions incorporated in H.R. 4365, decisions by qualified physicians about the appropriate means to treat their patients and to prescribe and dispense medications are not a proper matter for government regulation. 
   While the bill clearly provides authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations to expand the pool of qualified physicians, it is not the intention of our legislation that those regulations extend to the practice of medicine.

An unauthorized and ill-advised attempt to regulate the practice of medicine, including the practice of prescribing anti-addiction medication, would make it unworkable.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the life and accomplishments of a distinguished and principled public servant who served as a Member of Congress from my home state of Michigan, Neil Staebler. For nearly six decades, Neil embodied the very ideals on which this nation was founded. Born in 1905, Neil Staebler is widely credited as a founder of the modern Michigan Democratic Party. However, Neil's greatest desire was to make our government work for all its citizens. 
   Throughout his life, Neil dedicated himself to serving the United States of America. At the age of thirty-seven, he joined the World War II effort by enlisting in the United States Navy, where he served as a lieutenant. 
   After the conclusion of the war, Neil and a group of other distinguished citizens from Michigan, including former Governor G. Mennen Williams, former Congresswoman and Lieutenant Governor Martha Griffiths, and Martha's husband Hicks, helped to re-shape the Michigan Democratic Party and alter the landscape of Michigan politics. They sought to reinvigorate the Democratic Party and make it more responsive to the will and the needs of Michigan's citizens. Their efforts led to a renewed vibrancy within the Michigan Democratic Party, and propelled Neil to the chairmanship of the Party. 
   Neil served as state chairman for over a decade, and was able to use his position to encourage active political participation by all people. In addition to serving as state chairman and winning a seat to Congress in 1962, he ran an unsuccessful but hard fought challenge of Governor George Romney in 1964. 
   While he was a loyal member of the Democratic Party, Neil Staebler was first and foremost committed to our nation's institutions and the need for all citizens to participate in the democratic process. President Gerald Ford recognized Neil's commitment to civic participation when he appointed him to serve on the first Federal Elections Commission. 
   Throughout this year's election, people of differing political allegiances have remarked on the stable and resilient nature of our nation's institutions. Our health as a democracy is due, in a large part, to the dedication and efforts of individuals like Neil Staebler. Neil Staebler was one of the true lions of Michigan and American politics. I am sure that my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring the memory of Neil Staebler, and in wishing his wife Burnette and their family well in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, late Wednesday night, the Michigan Legislature passed a bill that, if signed, will have a negative impact on public safety in my home state. The legislature passed the ``shall issue'' bill which would require that local licensing authorities ``shall'' or must issue a concealed handgun license to a person who passes a background check and a safety course. Notably, the legislature waited until after the election to pass the legislation. 
   The current law in our state now gives local gun boards discretion to issue concealed gun licenses where a need is shown. Current law allows local gun boards--each made up of a local sheriff, a county prosecutor and a designee of the State police--to determine who should be allowed to carry a concealed handgun. The legislation before the state legislature would take discretion away from local law enforcement and allow virtually any applicant to carry a concealed handgun. 
   In May of 1999, when the State Legislature last took up this bill, a coalition of law enforcement groups led the fight against it. Law enforcement soundly rejects the proliferation of concealed weapons in our communities and have warned that this legislation will move Michigan in a dangerous direction. 
   The Michigan Law Enforcement Coalition issued the following statement about the bill:  
   Current law authorizes a local gun board made up of local law enforcement officials to issue CCW [Carry Concealed Weapons] licenses to those citizens who show a demonstrated need to carry a concealed weapon. Legislation that would shift the burden of proof, requiring the board to issue a permit unless it can state a reason, is a state-mandated ``shall issue'' bill and eliminates local control. 
   The Michigan Law Enforcement Coalition opposes any legislation which strips local gun boards of their discretion and shifts the burden of proof from the applicant to the gun board.  
   The Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police issued this statement:  
   This bill not only puts citizens at risk but will also effect law enforcement officers trying to do a difficult and dangerous job. Officers, already concerned due to the proliferation of handguns, would have even more apprehension knowing that the odds of confronting a concealed weapon have been multiplied. The presence of a gun can make any situation more dangerous. A gun can turn routine arguments into episodes of serious injury or death. During stressful times reasonable people do unreasonable things. The shouting match over a parking space or the fist fight at a sporting event can escalate into a shoot-out when guns are more accessible. Already nearly one-third of all murders committed are the result of an argument according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. 
   The Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police urges the Michigan Legislature to refrain from allowing the proliferation of concealed weapons without adequate safeguards by county licensing authorities. An armed society is a frightened and dangerous society.  
   Law enforcement groups were joined in their opposition to this bill by religious leaders, child advocates, and community leaders. Groups such as the Michigan Catholic Conference, Michigan PTA, Michigan Municipal League, Michigan's Children, Michigan Library Association, Michigan Association of Elementary and Middle School Principals, Michigan Association of Nonpublic Schools-Parent Network, Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, Michigan Association of Theatre Owners, and National Conference for Community and Justice are unified against the ``shall issue'' standard.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a fine public servant, Michael H. Dettmer, on his retirement. 
   Since January of 1994, Mike has served diligently as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Michigan. During his seven-year tenure, his office obtained more than 2700 convictions and helped lead numerous crime fighting initiatives in the District involving Federal law enforcement's support, leadership and participation. 
   Among his impressive accomplishments are the task forces and partnerships he helped create and foster to combat drugs and violent crime. A few of those specialized partnerships are the Methcathinone Task Force, the Benton Harbor Violent Crime Task Force, the Health Care Fraud Task Force, the Western Michigan Environmental Task Force and Project Exile. 
   Mike is also to be credited for reinvigorating the Law Enforcement Coordinating Committee/Victim-Witness unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Since 1994, this unit has adopted an elementary school in the Grand Rapids public school system, participated in the D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and D.E.F.Y (Drug Education For Youth) programs, and sponsored more than 80 training programs covering all aspects of law enforcement. In addition, under Mike's leadership, four additional sites to the Weed and Seed Program have been created, making the Western District of Michigan's program one of the largest initiatives among any Federal District in the United States. 
   In recognition of his efforts, in 1998, Mike was honored by the Department of Justice Programs Director and Assistant Attorney General Laurie Robinson for his work in the area of crime prevention and reduction. In addition, in the year 2000, Mike was honored by the national Executive Office of Weed and Seed with it's ``Creating Healthy Communities'' Award and by the City of Benton Harbor with the presentation of its ``Key to the City'' Award. 
   Of course, his many achievements could not have been attained without the love and support of his wife of more than 30 years, Teckla, and their children, Janna and Bryn. Mr. President, I know that the members of the Senate will join me in congratulating Mike on a job well-done and thanking him for his service to the people of Michigan.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Michael Bloomfield, USAF. Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield was the pilot of the space shuttle Endeavor during its recent 11-day mission to make repairs to the International Space Station Alpha. One of the highlights of this mission was the installation of new solar wings to provide electricity for the astronauts and cosmonauts who live and work there. These solar panels are 240 feet from tip to tip, the longest structure deployed in space. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield was born in Flint, Michigan. He graduated from Lake Fenton High School, and still considers Fenton, Michigan, as his hometown. He attended the United States Air Force Academy, where he was captain of the United States Air Force Academy Falcon Football Team. He received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Mechanics from the Air Force Academy, and a Master of Science Degree in Engineering Management from Old Dominion University. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield was trained as an F-15 Fighter Pilot, and has been assigned to NASA since 1995. This was his second space flight. His first flight was a mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir to exchange U.S. crew members. 
   Mr. President, we in Michigan are proud of Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield's record as a NASA astronaut. I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Lieutenant Colonel Bloomfield for his outstanding service to our nation.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and work of a truly remarkable American and long-time Detroit resident, Fred Gorospe. Born in 1902 in the Philippines, he pursued a dream to journey to America and become part of this great democracy. He overcame many obstacles as a young immigrant, and eventually was able to study mechanical engineering at Purdue University, becoming one of only three minorities hired into the engineering department of the Ford Motor Company not long after the Great Depression. He devoted himself to community and public service, and helped pave the way for many Filipino Americans like himself to assimilate into the mainstream of American life. Fred enjoyed a full life of 97 years and had the good fortune of having a loving wife, Helen, and a caring family that includes four sons and four daughters, and 10 grandchildren. He is well-remembered for his great sense of charity, and his unshakeable faith that people working together can make a difference. 
   In his lifetime, Fred provided leadership to numerous organizations, including the Federation of Filipinos of Michigan, Michigan Democratic State Central Committee, Advisory Council of Wayne County Community College, Advisory Board and Board of Directors of Detroit Area Agency on Aging, Board of Directors of the International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit, President of Far Eastern Festival of Detroit, Steering Committee of Ethnic Festivals of Detroit, cofounder of Fil-Am Association, and member of the University of Michigan and American Assembly of Columbia University on Philippine-American Relations. Fred made a significant contribution to Detroit's culture, and helped to bridge understanding of and appreciation for diversity. He worked hard to advance equal opportunities for education and social and economic achievement, and promoted the American ideal of social justice. 
   I would like to express my admiration for the life and accomplishments of Fred Gorospe. We can all benefit from his example of courage, perseverance and leadership. Fred has left an indelible mark on Detroit's history and its community. His family can be proud of his legacy. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in paying tribute to Fred Gorospe, and in congratulating his family on his exemplary and principled dedication to helping and enriching the lives of others.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a company in my home State of Michigan which is to be commended for its efforts to reduce gun injuries and deaths. Last month, Meijer Stores paired up with a coalition of law enforcement officials to implement a firearm buyback program in selected counties in Michigan. 
   The firearm buyback program, called ``Project Homesafe,'' allows gun owners to receive a $50 Meijer cash card in exchange for every functioning firearm. Meijer Stores donated $100,000 worth of these cash cards to promote the disposal of unwanted guns. Guns turned in under this program are expected to be destroyed. 
   Mr. President, Project Homesafe is a constructive enterprise and the kind of public-private partnership needed to promote safety in Michigan homes and communities. I applaud the initiative of Meijer Stores as well as Attorney General Jennifer Granholm, the Michigan Sheriffs' Association, Ingham County Sheriff Gene Wriggelsworth, and Kent County Sheriff James Dougan, all of whom were instrumental in implementing Project Homesafe.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier in the year, when the Bankruptcy Reform bill was before the Senate, I voted in favor of the bill. I said at the time that ``over the course of debate, the Senate adopted more than 40 amendments, making this a more reasonable approach to bankruptcy reform.'' However, I also said that ``should this legislation come back from conference ..... without the modest amendments we adopted in the Senate, I will consider opposing the bill at that time.'' 
   The bill before us is one I cannot support. The negotiators who worked out the differences between the Senate and House passed versions of the bill, deleted or weakened many of the provisions that were key components of the Senate-passed bankruptcy reform bill. Both of the amendments that I sponsored were deleted from the final version of the bill. One of those amendments simply required a study to determine if credit card companies use residences or zip codes to determine credit worthiness. The other amendment I sponsored would have prohibited credit card companies from applying interest charges on the paid portion of a balance during a so-called grace period. 
   Another provision that was deleted was Senator SCHUMER's amendment, which passed by an enormous margin in the Senate. The Schumer Amendment would have ensured that perpetrators of clinic violence, who incurred debt as a result of unlawful acts, could not discharge that debt in bankruptcy proceedings. 
   I am also concerned that the Senate-passed proposal to curb debtor abuse by closing the homestead loophole was weakened in conference. The homestead loophole permits debtors in certain states to shield luxurious homes, while shedding thousands of dollars of debt in bankruptcy. The Senate passed an amendment to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on the homestead exemption, thus closing the loophole. The conference report still allows for such abuse of the system so long as the expensive home was purchased two years in advance of the bankruptcy filing. This provision allows sophisticated debtors with the resources to plan ahead for bankruptcy to game the system. 
   Furthermore, I am disappointed with the unusual legislative process the majority used to file this conference report. The bill before us today, H.R. 2415, was originally introduced as the American Embassy Security Act. Last August, when the Senate passed this legislation and requested a conference with the House, it dealt with State Department and international security matters. More than a year later, the House appointed conferees, stripped the international security provisions from the bill and replaced them with a version of a bankruptcy reform bill. That is the wrong way to legislate. 
   Mr. President, I believe that bankruptcy reform could have been resolved in a fair and bipartisan way. Unfortunately, it was not handled in this way and so I cannot lend my support to the bill.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three outstanding people from my home state of Michigan. On December 10, 2000, Dr. Charles G. Adams, Heaster Wheeler and Wendy Wagenheim are being recognized for their outstanding leadership in this year's ``All Kids First'' campaign initiative. 
   Dr. Charles G. Adams has served as Pastor of Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan, since 1969, and is one of Detroit's pre-eminent religious and civil rights leaders. Because of his eloquence and command of the issues, he is highly sought after as a speaker on issues of faith and social justice. He served as Co-Chair of the All Kids First initiative, participating in televised debates and helped to lead the effort among his colleagues in the religious community and the community at large. Finally, I would like to add a heartfelt ``Happy Birthday'' to Dr. Adams, who will be celebrating his 64th birthday on December 13, 2000. 
   Heaster Wheeler is the Executive Director of the Detroit Branch NAACP, the largest NAACP chapter in the United States. Wendy Wagenheim serves as Legislative Director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan. Their combined experience in government, community service and public relations was invaluable in the All Kids First initiative. Together, Mr. Wheeler and Ms. Wagenheim participated in more than 45 debates about Proposal 1 throughout the state of Michigan. Their efforts were instrumental in defeating the proposal and in ensuring that all of Michigan's public schools will have adequate resources to educate our children. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Charles Adams, Heaster Wheeler and Wendy Wagenheim as they are honored for their leadership of Michigan's All Kids First initiative, and in encouraging them to keep fighting on behalf of Michigan's children and to improve Michigan's public schools.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been over a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Last Tuesday, on Election Day, voters in Colorado and Oregon fed up with such violence voted overwhelmingly to close the gun-show loophole, which extends background checks to all prospective purchasers of firearms at gun shows. Voters in those states recognized the need to pass responsible gun laws that can keep our schools and streets safe. Now, Congress should follow their lead. 
   Until Congress acts, those of us in the Senate who are committed to enacting responsible gun laws, will read the names of a number of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year. The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   NOVEMBER 14, 1999 
   Kenneth Jeffcoat, 18, Washington, DC; 
   George Jones, 20, Washington, DC; 
   Derrick Rogers, 43, Detroit, MI; 
   Andrian Thomas, 23, Detroit, MI; 
   Unidentified male, 25, Long Beach, CA; 
   Unidentified male, 20, Norfolk, VA; and 
   Unidentified male, San Francisco, CA. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago on November 2, 1999, the last day the Senate was in session. 
   NOVEMBER 2, 1999 
   Robert Lee Covington, 51, Memphis, TN; 
   Carey Jackson, 34, Fort Worth, TX; 
   Eddie Kennedy, 28, Atlanta, GA; 
   Victor Killebrew, 36, St. Louis, MO; 
   Dwayne Lemon, 36, Chicago, IL; 
   Douglas Pendleton, 30, Chicago, IL; 
   Joseph Slater, 19, Kansas City, MO; 
   Angel Walker, 20, St. Louis, MO; 
   Charles Watts, 19, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Unidentified female, San Francisco, CA; 
   Unidentified male, 40, Honolulu, HI; 
   Unidentified male, 30, Honolulu, HI; 
   Unidentified male, 58, Honolulu, HI; 
   Unidentified male, 54, Honolulu, HI; 
   Unidentified male, 46, Honolulu, HI; 
   Unidentified male, 36, Honolulu, HI; and 
   Unidentified male, 36, Honolulu, HI. 
   The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that Congress must enact sensible gun legislation now.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Thursday, November 16, 2000, the people of Michigan, will pay tribute to Mr. Woodrow W. Woody, president and owner of the longest running car dealership in the Nation--Woody Pontiac Sales, Inc. Mr. Woody, who continued active participation in the business, until he was 92 years old in June 2000, when he officially closed the Pontiac dealership he opened in the city of Hamtramck, MI in 1940. 
   Mr. Woody has come to be known as the pillar of his industry. In 1966, his dealership hit its peak year with the sale of 2,200 cars. Revered by his peers and the people of Michigan, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. Over the 60-year operation of his dealership, Woody, as he is called by friends and family, estimates that he sold over 100,000 Pontiacs, one of General Motors' leading products. He says his success is due to his genuine love of life and people. 
   This immigrant from Lebanon, embodies the ultimate success story of the American dream. Much of why he is being honored is because of his dedication and loyalty to the citizens of the city of Hamtramck and his beloved Lebanon. When the economy recessed and auto sales reflected a downturn, Woody never considered moving his dealership from the community that supported him through prosperous times. Hailed for his philanthropic activities, he spearheaded a drive to build a new facility for the Hamtramck Public Library. In addition, he has worked with Junior Achievement and the Rotary Club for more than 50 years accomplishing projects which support community growth. Woody has also been just as committed to the people of his homeland, where he has built a school and medical clinic. 
   Although Woody promises to continue his work in the community, interacting with various civic and fraternal organizations for the good of the community, the industry has lost its senior statesman and he will be sorely missed. We all wish Woody continued health, happiness and prosperity in the years ahead. I am sure my colleagues join me in the celebration of the life of Mr. Woodrow W. Woody, extending to him the good will and wishes of the Senate.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act addresses many of the water resource needs of our nation. But it also includes a provision relating to the export of water from the Great Lakes which needs some clarification.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week I submitted a list of some of the high profile shootings that took place over the past two years and the casualties that occurred as a result. That list was long, far too long. The number of shootings, in schools and public places, have claimed the lives of too many Americans, especially our young people. 
   I believe all of us want to know why children in the United States seem more vulnerable to gun violence than children in other industrialized nations? Some would argue that it is because American children are watching movies and television programs that are disturbingly violent. Some say that our children are lacking in religious influences. Certainly, these may be factors, and we should do everything we can to steer our kids in the right direction, but if we are going to protect children's lives, we must first and foremost limit our children's access to guns. 
   I have repeatedly made the point that Canadian children, who play the same video games and watch the same movies are much safer than their American counterparts. The reason-- Canadian laws successfully limit minors' access to firearms while American laws do not. 
   How else can one explain that during the year 1999 in Detroit, Michigan there were 337 homicides committed with firearms (Source: Michigan State Police). For the same year, in Windsor, Ontario, a city less than half a mile away from Detroit, there was just a single firearm homicide (Source: Windsor Police Services). In one year, 337 firearm homicides in Detroit versus one in Windsor, even though the children in these cities often listen to the same radio stations and watch the exact same television programs. That is a shocking statistic, one that should jolt this Congress to action. Unfortunately, to my great disappointment, this Congress will adjourn without doing a single thing to protect our children from gun violence in Detroit or anywhere else in America.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 106th Congress is about to adjourn without passing critical legislation to reduce the level of gun violence in this country. 
   Over the last years, the American people have been demanding that their schools, places of worship, and other public places be better protected from gun violence. Congress had an opportunity to address the gun violence problem in our country by passing sensible gun laws that would help ensure that young people or those with criminal backgrounds do not illegally gain access to firearms. In the end, Congress failed the American people. 
   It is very disappointing that Congress refused to act on the issue of gun violence. Too many senseless shootings have put our sense of safety in jeopardy. Here are just some of the high profile shootings that took place during this session of Congress, and the casualties that occurred as a result. 
   In the year 1999: 
   January 14, an office building, Salt Lake City, Utah, one dead, one injured; 
   March 18, a law office, Johnson City, Tennessee, two dead; 
   April 15, a library, Salt Lake City, Utah, three dead, four injured; 
   April 20, a high school, Littleton, Colorado, 15 dead, 23 injured; 
   May 20, a high school, Conyers, Georgia, six injured; 
   June 3, a grocery store, Las Vegas, Nevada, four dead; 
   June 11, a psychiatrist's office, Southfield, Michigan, three dead, four injured; 
   July 4, multiple locations, Illinois and Indiana, three dead, nine injured; 
   July 29, two day trading firms, Atlanta, Georgia, 13 dead, 13 injured; 
   August 5, two office buildings, Pelham, Alabama, three dead; 
   August 10, a Jewish Community Center, Los Angeles, California, five injured, and later in the same day, one dead; 
   September 14, a hospital, Anaheim, California, three dead; 
   September 15, a church, Fort Worth, Texas, eight dead, seven injured; 
   November 2 an office building, Honolulu, Hawaii, seven dead; 
   November 3, a shipyard, Seattle, Washington, two dead, two injured; 
   December 6, a middle school, Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, four injured; and 
   December 30, a hotel, Tampa, Florida, five killed, three injured. 
   In the year 2000: 
   January 23, a Sikh temple, El Sobrante, California, one dead, one injured; 
   February 14, a sandwich shop, Littleton, Colorado, two dead; 
   February 29, an elementary school, Flint, Michigan, one dead; 
   March 1, several locations, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, three dead, two injured; 
   March 8, the scene of a fire, Memphis, Tennessee, four dead, two injured; 
   March 10, a high school dance, Savannah, Georgia, two dead, one injured; 
   March 24, a State office building, Effingham, Illinois, two dead; 
   April 18, a seniors home, Lincoln Park, Michigan, two dead, one injured; 
   April 24, a zoo, Washington, D.C., seven injured; 
   April 28, several locations, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, five killed, one injured; 
   April 28, a restaurant and hotel, Salt Lake City, Utah, two dead, three injured; 
   May 11, a middle school, Prairie Grove, Arkansas, two injured; 
   May 17, a ball park, Ozark, Alabama, two dead, one injured; 
   May 26, a middle school, Lake Worth, Florida, one dead; 
   June 25, a basketball court, Chicago, Illinois, seven injured; 
   August 28, a professor's office, Fayetteville, Arkansas, two dead; 
   September 7, a sewage lagoon, Bunker, Missouri, two dead, two injured; 
   September 24, a high school, outside Seattle, Washington, one injured; 
   September 26, a middle school, New Orleans Louisiana, two injured; 
   October 20, a courthouse, Yreka, California, one dead, two injured; and 
   October 23, a pizzeria in New Baltimore, Michigan, one dead. 
   Gun violence is a critical issue that the majority of Americans care about deeply. The will of the majority can be frustrated in the short run, but not in the long run. This issue will not go away. If this Congress will not pass legislation addressing gun violence in America, I am confident that another Congress will, and I will continue to work toward that objective.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is outrageous that another Congress has passed without the enactment of legislation which would resolve the problem of the interstate transportation of solid waste. The people should not be dumped on any longer. They should have some control over their own jurisdictions and over their own land. It is up to us to give them that authority. I just heard that Toronto Canada is thinking about sending its waste to Michigan and the people of Michigan have nothing to say about it.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, thousands of young people observed the Fifth Annual Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. Students across the country who participated in the day's activities were given the chance to make a strong statement renouncing the violent use of guns by signing a voluntary pledge. 
   In my own State of Michigan, high school senior Vince Villegas of Lansing worked to ensure that the anti-gun violence pledges were distributed to students in his own school district. Vince is the co-founder and current president of Students Against Firearm Endangerment, SAFE, USA, an organization whose mission is to reduce the number of gun casualties by increasing gun education in America's schools. With help from students like Vince, more than one million young people have signed the Student Pledge Against Gun Violence during this year alone. 
   Here is what that pledge says: ``I will never bring a gun to school; I will never use a gun to settle a dispute; I will use my influence with my friends to keep them from using guns to settle disputes. My individual choices and actions, when multiplied by those of young people throughout the country, will make a difference. Together, by honoring this pledge, we can reverse the violence and grow up in safety.'' 
   Vince and students like him around the country have pledged to do what they can to reduce the toll of gun violence in their lives. Now it's up to Congress to learn from our young people and pledge to combat the gun violence that plagues the Nation's schools and communities.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to acknowledge a lawyer, from my home State of Michigan, of great intellectual capacity and a passion for justice, Boaz Siegel, who dedicated his life to fighting for working men and women. On October 20th of this year, hundreds of people will gather for the dedication of the new headquarters for the Pipefitters, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Service Local 636. This dedication will also serve as a tribute to Mr. Siegel, and will culminate in his being made an honorary member of Local 636. 
   Boaz Siegel has dedicated his academic and professional life to studying, teaching and practicing the laws that affect the well-being of all workers. Believing that the law could be a noble profession dedicated to the public good, he enrolled in the Wayne State University Law School. While in law school he balanced the responsibilities of family, work and pursuing numerous social causes. He excelled in his law studies at Wayne State University, and received his Juris Doctorate in 1941. 
   Upon graduating law school, Boaz's plans to enter private practice were delayed as he was asked to work in the Wayne State Law Library. This quickly led to a teaching position at the law school where he taught from 1941 through 1972. During this time, he briefly left to join Samuel Schwartz and Rolland O'Hare in a private practice that my brother, Sander Levin, joined shortly after its inception. After a year in practice, Boaz returned to teaching and was made assistant to the provost and a full professor at Wayne State University Law School. 
   Although passionate about teaching, Boaz Siegel's first love remained labor law. While teaching at Wayne State in the 1950s, he served as legal counsel to the trustees of fringe benefit, pension and health funds. One such fund, the Detroit and Vicinity Construction Workers Health and Welfare Fund, possessed 45,000 participants. In 1962, he was appointed by the United States Secretary of Labor to a position on the first U.S. Council on Employee Welfare and Pension Plans. 
   Two years later, his considerable talents as an arbitrator were acknowledged when he became a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators. However, it was his fund work that consumed most of his time, and led him to leave teaching and enter law practice full-time in 1972. His work with many unions, including Local 636, has ensured a better future for thousands of workers and their families. 
   Boaz Siegel can take pride in his long and honorable service to the working people of Michigan. I am honored to call this man a mentor, colleague and friend. I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Boaz Siegel for his commitment to working men and women, the labor movement and teaching and practicing law.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations conference report (H.R. 4461). Included in this bill is funding which will, among other things, assist our Nation's farmers, aid  rural development, preserve delicate ecosystems and provide food assistance to our Nation's most needy individuals. However, I am concerned about several recent reports conducted by the USDA's Office of Inspector General, and a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) that criticizes the ability of USDA's Office of Civil Rights to process and resolve civil rights cases in a timely fashion. I recognize that Secretary Glickman has done much to remedy the civil rights problems he inherited when he became Secretary, and I encourage him to continue these efforts.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the achievements of an accomplished businessman, distinguished public servant and committed philanthropist from my home state of Michigan, Ambassador David B. Hermelin. On October 22 of this year, the ORT Hermelin College of Engineering will be dedicated in Netanya, Israel. This dedication is a fitting tribute for a man, who along with his wife Doreen, has committed himself to his family, nation and charitable endeavors throughout the world. 
   Through hard work and an unwavering commitment to the public good, David's work has made an indelible mark upon countless individuals. His keen intellect, business acumen and heart for others has led him to pursue a wide array of business and charitable efforts in the United States and abroad. 
   David has been deeply involved with the World ORT, having served as the President of American ORT. Founded in response to a famine in Russia in the late 1860s, ORT is a private, non-profit organization that addresses the educational and technical training needs of workers, providing them with the training and self-sufficiency needed to build a meaningful existence. To achieve this goal, ORT builds schools and develops a curriculum that provides students with vital technical skills. ORT has facilities in nearly 60 nations. This year, over 200,000 students are enrolled in ORT programs. 
   The mission of American ORT is to raise funding necessary to support the efforts of World ORT and administer domestic ORT programs. During David's tenure as President of this organization, American ORT increased its involvement in the mission of World ORT, and strengthened its ties with the larger Jewish community. These strengthened ties were evidenced by the fact that the 1999 General Assembly of the United Jewish Communities of North America was the second consecutive General Assembly sponsored by ORT. 
   American ORT administers two post-secondary training institutes and one college in the United States. These three institutions serve 5,000 individuals annually, many from the former Soviet Union and Newly Independent States (NIS), by providing them with technical training, English language assistance and career development skills. 
   David has been involved in many other charitable endeavors as an administrator, contributor and fundraiser. He has served on the Board of Directors for many community and national organizations including the Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
   As a businessman, David has worked as a real estate developer, venture capitalist and manager of many interests. Currently, he is the co-owner of two of the largest entertainment facilities in the state of Michigan--the Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, and the Pine Knob Entertainment Centers. In addition, he sits on the board of several companies including Arbor Drugs Inc., Arena Associates, Village Green Management Company and First America Bank Corporation--Detroit. 
   In December 1997, President Clinton recognized David's commitment to public service, and appointed him to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Norway. So extraordinary was his service in this capacity that the Norweigian people awarded him the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, which is equivalent to being knighted. 
   David Hermelin has been a community leader for over forty years. As a fellow native of Detroit, Michigan, I have known David for over half of a century. I am pleased to call him an inspiration, a peer and a friend. I am sure that my Senate colleagues will join me in offering my congratulations to David Hermelin for the dedication of the ORT Hermelin College of Engineering, and in wishing him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senate passes the miscellaneous tariff bill, I would like to bring attention to a provision in the bill that would grant permanent normal trade relations, PNTR to the Republic of Georgia. In general, I support the proposition that the time is ripe for Georgia to receive PNTR. However, I also think we should recognize that the Republic of Georgia has demonstrated enforcement of internationally recognized core labor standards. 
   Georgia grants its citizens the right to emigrate. It is a leader in democratic reform in the Caucuses. It has a relatively strong human rights record. It has been shedding its status as a non-market economy, and this year became a member of the WTO. And it has been an important strategic partner of the United States. 
   To a certain extent, these accomplishments are acknowledged in the preambulatory clauses to the PNTR grant. But there is something missing. There is no recognition of Georgia's effective record of enforcing internationally recognized core labor labor standards and its demonstrated commitment to continue its protection of worker rights in the future. I hope that this gap can be filled in when the bill goes to conference. 
   Why should a grant of PNTR to Georgia acknowledge that country's protection of worker rights and its commitment to continue protecting worker rights? Because, increasingly, U.S. trade policy is reflecting the link between trade and labor. Different countries' different levels of protection of core labor standards have an impact on trade. We cannot ignore that. Indeed, we affirmatively recognized that fact in both the China/PNTR bill and in the Africa/CBI bill. 
   It stands to reason that when we make a significant change in our trade relationship with another country--as when we grant PNTR--we ought to take account of that country's enforcement (or lack of enforcement) of core labor standards. Here, the country in issue has a strong record in this area. We ought to recognize that fact, since it reinforces the case for granting PNTR. This sends an important signal to future PNTR candidates. 
   Therefore, I hope that, in conference, we will be able to include a simple recognition of Georgia's record and its commitment going forward.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join many of my colleagues in commemorating National Hispanic Heritage Month. The nationwide celebration of Hispanic heritage was initiated by the 90th Congress in 1968, which designated National Hispanic Heritage Week. Twenty years later, the 100th Congress transformed this week into a month, designating the period of September 15 to October 15 as a time to recognize the Hispanic influence in and contributions to our culture and society. 
   For over 400 years, Hispanic Americans have played a fundamental role in the history of the United States. The first European expedition in recorded history to land in what is today the continental United States was led by the former Spanish Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de Leon. 
   America's diverse and vibrant Hispanic population has made an enormous contributions to the building and strengthening of our nation, its culture, and its economic prowess. As we cross the threshold of a new century, we look to the outstanding contributions of Hispanic Americans for inspiration and leadership. My hometown, Detroit, was made great in the twentieth century in part by immigrants who went there to find work and provide for their families. This great dream lives on today as thousands of immigrants come to Detroit every year from countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Cuba. In fact, Southwest Detroit, known as Mexicantown by its residents, is the fastest growing part of Detroit. Hispanics who have come to Detroit have opened businesses, bought homes and turned a once neglected urban neighborhood into a thriving community that has become one of the centers of the city. 
   One woman, Maria Elena Rodriguez, has had a lot to do with this turnaround. Her hard work as president of the Mexicantown Community Development Corporation has helped to provide the spark needed to reinvigorate a community. Ms. Rodriguez is currently in the process of helping to build a welcome center for people coming into Detroit across the Ambassador Bridge, an effort she hopes will fulfil her mission to bring more business and visitors to her neighborhood.  
   Hispanic contributions to Michigan businesses abound. The Kellogg Company, founded and headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan, has millions of customers in over 160 countries, and is the world's leading producer of cereal. Its CEO is Carlos Gutierrez, who started with Kellogg's as a sales representative in Mexico City, and after 25 years with the company is now in charge of this global giant. 
   Education has long played a prominent role in Hispanic culture. The first free integrated public school was established in St. Augustine, Florida in September of 1787. On March 31, 2000 Rebecca Arenas was awarded the ``Caesar Chavez Civil Rights Achievement Award'' for her work to better the lives of Hispanics in general, and migrant workers in particular. Rebecca's parents brought her to Michigan at the age of 5 from Crystal City, Texas. Her parents were migrant workers who chose to stay in Michigan because they believed it would allow Rebecca to have a better education. Because of the actions of her parents, Rebecca developed a commitment to education that would last a lifetime. Rebecca passed this commitment to education onto her children, all seven of whom have received a post-secondary education. In addition to the ``Caesar Chavez'' award, Rebecca has received recognition on numerous other occasions because of her work in education, health care, and voter registration. 
   For these and countless others reasons, it is a pleasure for me to stand today with my Senate colleagues in commemorating National Hispanic Heritage Month.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the last few years, high profile school shootings across this country have left teachers, parents, and students scared and confused. In response, the FBI has conducted an exhaustive study on school shootings in an effort to assess, intervene and prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future. The report, entitled, ``School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective,'' recommends specific steps for school officials to take to prevent youth violence. The report notes that in the vast majority of cases, kids do not turn violent overnight. Instead, those who become violent tend to exhibit increasingly disturbing patterns of behavior as their fascination with violence builds. By learning to recognize these behavioral signs, teachers and students can be prepared to investigate and intervene before potentially violent situations get out of control. 
   The FBI report goes on to suggest specific measures schools can take to head off potential shootings. The report recommends that students and faculty should be trained to recognize certain warning signs that students may be considering committing violent acts; groups of faculty and students should be established to encourage students not to keep silent when they recognize potential threats; programs should be developed to teach parents to recognize behavior that may indicate that their children are prone to acts of violence. In addition to these preventive measures, the FBI recommends that schools establish specially trained Threat Assessment Teams to handle evaluating and responding to threats if and when they arise. 
   The FBI warns teachers, parents, and students that they should not ignore any threat of violence. We in Congress should follow the same advice. Yet, while parents and school officials are pursuing more vigorous responses to potential violence, we in Congress seem to be less responsive to such danger. Over the last few years, many of us in Congress have continually tried to close the loopholes in our laws that permit school children to gain access to firearms. Unfortunately, our efforts have been stymied by the leadership in the House of Representatives. In a few weeks, this session of Congress will come to an end. Before we adjourn, let's do our part and reduce the threat of gun violence in our schools and communities.

   Mr. LEVIN. First, I want to compliment the Chairman and the Ranking Member, Ms. MIKULSKI, for bringing this bill to the Senator floor and for the Subcommittee's attention to the health, rehabilitation and research programs funded by this bill that are critical to our Nation's veterans. 
   I also want to compliment the Chairman and the Ranking Member for the subcommittee's report language that urges the VA's Rehabilitation Research Office to conduct a demonstration project to assess the impact of a new mobility technology on the ability of veterans to perform work functions, thereby leading to increased opportunities for veterans with disabilities to return to work. This innovative mobility device is a major advance in that it has  the ability to climb stairs, traverse all terrain and balance the seated user at standing eye-level. It should, I hope, provide veterans who have mobility impairments with significant additional opportunities in the workplace. The demonstration project called for by the Subcommittee's language will help clarify the additional employment opportunities that such a device should create for our Nation's veterans. I thank the Subcommittee for its assistance in making process on this matter. 
   With new and emerging technologies becoming available that can assist veterans with disabilities, it is vital that the VA keep pace with the marketplace and ensure that veterans with disabilities have access to these advancements. I have had the pleasure of seeing this new mobility device perform its functions and it clearly holds great promise. I am hopeful that this demonstration project will show a significant impact that this device can have on the ability of veterans with disabilities to return to work and I am eager on review the findings of the demonstration. Would the Chairman agree that the demonstration that is requested in the Subcommittee's language be completed by May 1, 2001?

   Mr. LEVIN. The Great Waters program, authorized by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, assesses air deposition as a source of toxic contamination to key water bodies, including the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. Research suggests that at least half of all new toxic pollution loadings entering the Great Lakes may be transported and deposited by the atmosphere. Consistent funding for the monitoring of air deposition of toxic contaminants is especially critical at this time as the international community completes negotiations of an international treaty on persistent organic pollutants. The Great Waters program will provide a key component of the database used to judge the effectiveness of this international agreement in lowering the toxic contaminants entering the Great Lakes, and other great waters of the United States, from foreign sources.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this year's VA, HUD Appropriations bill contains $1 million for the City of Detroit for the Detroit River walkway or promenade. The riverfront is a focal point of Detroit's redevelopment efforts in connection with the City's upcoming 300th anniversary and plans are underway to construct an extensive, pedestrian-friendly walkway or promenade along the shoreline. I have personally been able to obtain support from this body for that purpose. The grant provided for in this bill will help defray the costs of the project, such as land acquisition, walkway installation and building demolition, and will help give Detroit a world-class waterfront. 
   We also have before the Senate today two very important amendments to this bill. The first would strike language in the report which delays the Environmental Protection Agency from making a final regulation for arsenic in drinking water. The National Academy of Sciences has found that the current regulations for the levels of arsenic in our water are unacceptable. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to lower the standard from the current 50 parts per billion to 5 parts per billion. I support that proposal and regret that I had to vote against this amendment. However, this amendment contained two provisions and it is the other provision I do not support. 
   That part of this amendment would strike language in the report which prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from designating an area in nonattainment under the Clean Air Act pursuant to the 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for ozone. I agree that an ozone standard should be in place to protect public health and  the environment. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to issue the 8-hour standard is currently under review by the United States Supreme Court. The Court will hear argument on November 7 to decide whether to uphold a Court of Appeals decision that invalidated the 8-hour standard on the grounds that the agency had assumed an ``unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.'' Even the EPA has agreed that it cannot actually implement efforts with respect to the 8-hour standard. Until the Supreme Court hears this case, we do not know whether the EPA even had the authority to make this new rule. Therefore, I agree that the EPA should refrain from using the standard--a standard that may be struck down as unenforceable--until the Supreme Court has made its determination regarding the constitutionality of the EPA's actions. 
   Now this isn't a frivolous matter. A nonattainment designation can detrimentally affect an area and, if not justified, would cause needless economic hardship, such as costly transportation conformity measures, should the Supreme Court rule that the 8-hour standard is unenforceable. Further, this standard could impose unfair economic burdens on a number of communities in Michigan that suffer from significant ozone and other pollution transported from more severely polluted areas. And it could be all for nought if the Supreme Court strikes down the standard. 
   Mr. President, I support the goals of the Clean Air Act. However, it needs to be applied in a common sense equitable manner if it is to retain the support of the American People. It is not equitable to designate an area in nonattainment if that designation may become null and void in a matter of months. For these reasons I voted against the Boxer Amendment. 
   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. President, I am pleased that, with my support, the Senate took another step today toward fulfilling our country's commitment to provide health care for our veterans. The fiscal year 2001 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report that passed the Senate this afternoon contains a $1.4 billion increase in veterans health care funding from the last year's appropriations level. 
   While I am pleased that we have finally come around to talking about additional funding for veterans health care, as opposed to three years of flat-line budget levels, I am disappointed that the funding level in the FY2001 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report falls short of the level proposed by veterans organizations. 
   The authoritative Independent Budget is produced by major veterans organizations including AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the VFW. The Independent Budget and The American Legion agree that the Veterans Administration will need at least $500 million more in funding than provided by this conference report. 
   I am pleased to have led the effort last year in the Senate to increase veterans health care funding. Through my efforts on the Senate Budget Committee and on the Senate floor, we were able to start reversing the negative effects of three years of flat-lined veterans health care budgets with an increase of $1.7 billion. I am pleased that my efforts appear to have convinced the Administration and Members of Congress to start talking about increases in veterans health care funding instead of keeping this budget stagnant. 
   This year, I was successful in getting a bipartisan amendment passed to the Senate Budget Resolution that added an additional $1.9 billion to last year's funding for veterans health care. The conference report that passed the Senate today fell $500 million short of this goal and will prevent the VA from adequately funding a number of important programs including medical care, research, long term care, and necessary facility construction and renovation. 
   While the $1.4 billion increase in this year's VA budget and the $1.7 billion increase from last year are important improvements, I'm afraid the funds are simply providing budgetary backfill for the years when the veterans health care needs were ignored. We need a VA veterans' health care budget that can adequately offset years of underfunding, the higher costs of medical care caused by consumer inflation, wage increases, and legislation passed by Congress. For the first time in a number of years, we're working with overall budget surpluses instead of budget deficits. Clearly, the funds are there to provide for veterans health care. It is simply a question of whether the political will is there to make veterans health care a priority instead of an afterthought. 
   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will continue to do all I can to encourage my colleagues to approve adequate funding levels for veterans health care. I look forward to continue working on a bipartisan basis with my Senate colleagues as well as with representatives of the veterans community in South Dakota.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator BRYAN, for purposes of clarification with respect to one definition in the Intelligence Authorization bill. And that's the definition of ``classified information'' in Section 304 of the bill which amends Section 798A of Title 18. Section 304 establishes as a crime the willful disclosure of classified information to an unauthorized person. In paragraph (c)(2) it defines ``classified information'' as ``information that the person knows or has reason to believe has been properly classified by appropriate authorities, pursuant to the provisions of a statute or Executive Order.....'' 
   Mr. President, I would like to ask the Vice Chairman's assurance that this bill is not intended to alter in any way the existing definitions of classified information contained in other statutes relevant to the protection of classified information and whistleblower rights. Is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. That was indeed the next point. We are blessed with a committee which operates on a bipartisan basis. The members of the committee work well together. The chairmen of our subcommittees work well. Our staffs work well together. We have many blessings to count being able to serve in this body and to serve our Nation, but surely one of our great blessings is being on a committee which is able to operate on such a bipartisan basis. 
   I echo Chairman WARNER's comments about the tragedy in Yemen this morning that involved the Navy ship, the U.S.S. Cole. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of those who have been lost in this despicable act of terrorism. Our hearts and prayers go out to the sailors who have survived who are now struggling for life. Our hearts and prayers go out to their families. We are in, as we surely understand, for a long battle against terrorist acts. 
   I notice my good friend from Kansas on the floor, chairman of the subcommittee that addresses new threats we face. The terrorist threat which was exemplified this morning in Yemen has been repeatedly pointed out by him and other members of the subcommittee and of the Senate as being the type of threat that we face. That kind of terrorist act is a real world threat which is here and now. 
   That was not a weapon of mass destruction, but it was a weapon that caused massive injury, massive death. We must put our brains and our resources together with allies to try to prevent these kinds of actions from occurring and, when they do occur, to bring the perpetrators to justice. 
   The Senator from New York has requested that I yield 5 minutes to him so he may make a statement at this time. The order that we had established by unanimous consent was that after my opening statement the Senator from Minnesota would be recognized, and then the Senator from Alabama would be recognized. I want someone on the other side of the aisle to hear this, but I ask unanimous consent that that be modified at this time so I may defer my opening statement to yield to the Senator from New York 5 minutes.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the Senator from New York is still on the floor, I commend him for his thoughtful comments about the Middle East. I was not only struck by the content of his comments, but also by the way in which they were so forcefully and calmly delivered, which I think will reverberate throughout this Chamber. 
   These are times of great violence in the Middle East. One of the most striking things to me is the silence of Chairman Arafat relative to violence. Prime Minister Barak has said to his own citizens, ``I urge our Jewish citizens to refrain from attacking Arabs and their property under any circumstances.'' From Chairman Arafat, we have had silence about the actions of the Palestinians in the streets. That silence speaks volumes. It was referred to by the good Senator from New York, and I want to again say that I thought his comments were exactly the right substance and tone. 
   I also want to expand on that one thought, about what we have not heard once from Chairman Arafat, which is a statement saying that violence--by whoever--is wrong. We have not even gotten that much from Chairman Arafat, and it is a huge and very obvious and intentional omission on his part, which speaks very loudly about what his intentions are. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend from Nevada.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the good Senator from New York. 
   Mr. President, let me now continue with my remarks relative to the Defense authorization bill itself. 
   The most far-reaching step that we have taken in this conference report is to answer the call of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to address shortcomings in the health care program. We provide health care for our military personnel and our retirees and their families. But there are shortcomings. There are gaps. There are holes. There are lapses. We are trying to fill those. We are trying to make the commitment of health care to our military men and women and to their families, and after they retire, a real-world commitment. We want to fulfill the promise of lifetime health care to those who complete a military career by providing, as we do in this bill, that retired members and their families remain in the TRICARE health program for life. When they become eligible for Medicare, TRICARE would serve as a Medigap-type policy and pay virtually all costs for medical care that are not covered by Medicare itself. This means that retirees will be able to choose any medical provider that accepts Medicare, and TRICARE would pay the deductibles and the copayments. 
   Second, the budget request that we approved improves access to health care for families of active duty members by eliminating deductibles and copayments for care provided by the TRICARE program. 
   We would also make TRICARE Prime available to the families of service members assigned to remote locations where they don't have access to military treatment facilities. And we provide for physical exams for family members when required for school enrollment. 
   Finally, we would address the rising price of prescription drugs by providing a generous pharmacy benefit for military retirees. Under this provision, prescriptions filled in a military facility will be free. Prescriptions filled through the military's national mail-order pharmacy will cost $8 for a 90-day supply. Retirees would pay a 20-percent copayment for prescriptions filled in a way which is on an approved list of retail pharmacies. There is the so-called ``network retail pharmacy.'' They  would pay a 25-percent copay for prescriptions filled in a non-network retail pharmacy; in other words, from a pharmacy not on the approved list. 
   I am appalled, as so many Members of this body are appalled, by the rising costs of pharmaceuticals in this country, and by the growing gap between the prices paid for drugs by our citizens and people who live in other countries--frequently, by the way, for prescription drugs manufactured in this country and often subsidized either directly by taxpayers in the form of NIH grants to people who develop those drugs and do the research on them, and indirectly through the Tax Code. We provide credits for research and development. We have this gap between what our citizens pay and citizens in other countries pay for drugs manufactured in the United States. We are not curing that gap in this bill, except we are taking a step relative to military retirees. This step at least addresses that problem for military retirees. 
   It is my hope that before the end of this session or in the next Congress that we will provide a similar benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The importance of this prescription drug program is shown by the effort that was made to achieve it. The importance of this benefit is reflected in the fact that military retirees brought to our attention the extraordinary expense to them of prescription drugs. We are responding to that. We have a moral obligation to respond to that because we made a commitment to them. 
   This country has a moral obligation surely to our seniors--I think to all of us, but at least to our seniors--to make prescription drugs affordable. We haven't made the same kind of commitment technically to our seniors. But surely we should feel the moral obligation to make sure our seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs. That commitment that we surely should feel, I believe, will be advanced by this action that we are taking relative to our military retirees. Hopefully it will prod us to do the same for all of our seniors as we do for our military retirees in the area of prescription drugs. 
   We cannot overlook the fact that these provisions are going to be expensive to implement. This bill would establish a new entitlement program for military retiree health care at an estimated cost of $60 billion. 
   The $60 billion cost of this program is over the next 10 years. It is actually, technically, a $40 billion net cost to the Government for reasons that I will go into when we get to the waiver of the point of order relative to the budget. 
   It is a significant amount of money, $60 billion of direct spending, or $40 billion net, over the next 10 years. Either one of those numbers is a big number. We should be very conscious of what we are doing. That is why it is very important this body act openly and forthrightly on this proposal. 
   Senator WARNER mentioned that we had made a proposal in committee which would have achieved this same goal on a phased-in basis, first for 2 years and then permanently, in a way which would have met the requirements of the Budget Act without creating a point of order. 
   In the wisdom of the conferees, we made this a permanent benefit. It is the right thing to do. But there is a cost to it which exceeds the amount of money this committee has been authorized to allocate under our mandatory spending limits. This body will then be offered the opportunity and presented with the question: Do we wish to waive that limit, to use the waiver authority as provided for us in the Budget Act, in order to approve this permanent benefit? 
   That will be argued at a later time in this debate. I intend to vote to waive the Budget Act and permit this benefit to go into effect for our retirees. However, it is important that this body, when it exceeds these spending allocations, does so in a way where everyone has a chance to recognize what it is we are doing in that regard. 
   As I said, there was no provision made in this year's budget resolution for this level of mandatory spending. We were given a very small amount, closer to half a billion. There was a way we could have operated within that level in a 2-year program, then expecting to make that permanent later on in a way which would have complied with the Budget Act. But this conference went in a different direction. It is a reasonable approach, perhaps even a more straightforward approach. In any event, it does create this point of order which we now need to address in this bill. 
   I believe these steps to address problems in the military health care system are the right thing to do. Again, we just should do so openly. We should not do so blindly. The problem is not with this bill but in the budget resolution itself, which is not realistic in the amount of money it provided for this and for other purposes. 
   The conference report also includes a title numbered 35 in the Senate bill which is the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. This Nation now has a great debt to the many workers in our nuclear weapons facilities who played such a vital role in winning the cold war, a deterrent which they produced which was able to deter aggression to help maintain security and peace. But we now know that many of these workers were exposed to dangerous radioactive and chemical materials in the course of their work, and they are now suffering from debilitating and often fatal illnesses as a result. It is simple justice that these workers and their families should be compensated for those illnesses. 
   The Department of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act provides that compensation, and it does so in a fair and balanced manner. We were able to overcome significant opposition in the House of Representatives and provide compensation to the loyal Department of Energy workers who were poisoned by that work in support of our Nation's defense. Now there is a cost. We should be aware of that cost. It is a cost of $1.1 billion over 5 years and about $1.6 billion over 10 years. 
   I am particularly pleased that the conferees rejected a House provision which would have prohibited the continued deployment of United States ground combat forces in Kosovo under certain 
   circumstances. What the House provision said was, if the specified contributions by our allies for civilian policing and reconstruction were not met by a target date, then our troops would automatically be withdrawn. 
   First of all, our European allies are almost to those levels. They are now clearly the senior partner in Kosovo. That is the right thing. We want our allies to be senior partners and the United States to be the junior partner. Many times we are not the senior partner. That is a very good development. 
   It would be a mistake, and this body voted it would be a mistake, to put in an automatic withdrawal date because of the uncertainty that would create, the weakening of the NATO alliance which would be created, and the negative impact of morale on our men and women who would then believe, somehow or other between now and that automatic removal date, that our troops may be removed. That kind of uncertainty is not healthy either in terms of who our adversary was and could still become theoretically; it is not healthy in terms of the NATO alliance; it is not healthy in terms of the morale of our men and women in uniform. 
   We have all put pressure on our European allies to do more. It is something in which many of us, if not most of us, believe. They are now doing more. Our response should be a positive response rather than this automatic threat that unless they meet a specified numerical target by a fixed date, something would automatically happen without any further action of the Congress. 
   The process in the House bill, which was rejected by the Senate after a lengthy floor debate, but adopted by the House, would have led to the automatic withdrawal of our forces, even if there was no action in the future by Congress. That at least, in my judgment, would not have been a responsible exercise of congressional authority but rather its abdication. Putting this on automatic pilot would not have been the best way to exercise congressional authority. 
   We have the power of the purse, and we have a right to exercise it. If we want to withdraw troops, we have the right to do that. If we have troops in too many places, we have the right to say: Pull them out, don't spend any money to keep them there. We have that responsibility. If we are in too many places, we are the ones with the  power of the purse. We can say: Pull forces out of here, pull forces out of there. 
   The specific effort to do that was made relative to Kosovo. It was rejected. I am glad, by the way, that both the candidates for President rejected that approach. But if we are going to do it, we ought to be accountable ourselves for doing it and not put something on automatic pilot so that something will happen in the future even if we do nothing between now and then. That is not the way I believe the power of the purse should be used. 
   I believe very deeply in the power of the purse, and I believe there are occasions when we want to say we believe that troops should not be in a certain place and we are not going to provide money for it. But that ought to be done directly and not be done at a future date in the absence of a decision by the Congress. 
   The conferees also rejected a provision that would have placed burdensome restrictions on our efforts to support the antidrug effort in Colombia. We rejected a provision that undermined our ability to implement agreements designed to prevent development of nuclear weapons by North Korea. We rejected a provision which implied that a national missile defense would be deployed immediately without regard to the system's operational effectiveness or affordability or the impact that it might have on our overall national security. Those were unwise provisions, in my judgment, and I am pleased they were not included in the conference report. 
   I am pleased the conferees did adopt a series of provisions implementing the agreement between President Clinton and the Governor of Puerto Rico regarding the status of training exercises by the Navy and Marine Corps on the island of Vieques. Training on Vieques, as we know, was suspended last year after the tragic death of a security guard at the training range. The Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations, and others have testified that there is just no adequate substitute for that training on the island of Vieques. 
   As of today, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has lived up to its obligations under the agreement. The training range on Vieques has been cleared of protesters with the assistance of the government of Puerto Rico, and Navy training exercises have now resumed on the island with the use of inert ordnance, as provided for in the agreement. 
   The Navy is working with the citizens of Vieques and others throughout Puerto Rico towards the resumption of live-fire training on Vieques. This bill, hopefully, provides the framework for the resumption of that training. 
   The President's budget request added $12 billion of defense spending to last year's appropriated levels, and the Congressional Budget Resolution added an additional $4.5 billion. For the most part, the conference report spends this money wisely, to meet needs that were identified as priorities by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or to accelerate items that are included in the Future Years Defense Plan. 
   The bill also provides funding support and legislative guidance for key Department of Defense priorities, including the Army's transformation plan and the Joint Strike Fighter Program. 
   On the first point, the conference report provides appropriate support for the Army transformation plan, the plan that was put forward by Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki. The conferees concluded that the Army needs to transform itself into a lighter, more lethal, survivable, and tactically mobile force. We approved all of the funds requested by the Army for this purpose, and we actually added some research money to the amount requested to help the Army in the long-term transformation process. 
   At the same time, we directed the Army to prepare a detailed roadmap for the transformation initiative and to conduct appropriate testing and experimentation to ensure that the transformation effort is successful. 
   Mr. President, I have a few more minutes but I have taken a little longer than I expected. I would like, at this point, if the Senator from Minnesota is ready, to yield to him for his presentation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, on the hate crimes legislation issue, my good friend from Virginia has accurately presented the facts. There are some additional facts, though, which should also be brought to bear. 
   I can't remember a time, although there may have been one, when the Senate has adopted language, as we did by a vote of 57-42, and when the House of Representatives has adopted language, as they did by 30 or 40 votes--when I say ``adopted language'' in the House, let me be clear, what the House of Representatives did was even more precise than adopt the hate crimes language; they instructed their conferees to agree to our hate crimes language by 30 or 40 votes--I cannot remember a time when one body has adopted language and the other body has instructed their conferees to yield to the first body's language where that language has then been dropped in conference. 
   I am not saying that has never happened because I haven't checked the records to be sure. I can say I can never remember it happening. Think about it. We had a big debate on this issue. We adopted Senator KENNEDY's hate crimes language by a vote of 57-42 in this body. Then the House had a debate, instructing their conferees to agree to our language, and somehow or other it is dropped in conference. 
   Let it be clear as to what happened. The House conferees would not accept our language, despite the instruction from the House of Representatives. Then we were faced with the question, Do we then give it up, despite the vote in the Senate? 
   There was a vote among Senate conferees. Ten Republicans and one Democrat voted basically to give it up, which was the 11-vote majority. Eight Democrats and one Republican voted not to give it up; let us maintain this fight; let us bring this language back in the conference report. If someone wants to filibuster a conference report, they have that right. But this legislation is too important. This is the hate crimes bill that this body adopted. It is simply too important a subject to be dropped because of the threat of a filibuster after being adopted in the Senate and having the House telling their folks to yield to us. If we refused to adopt important legislation around here whenever there was the threat of a filibuster, we would never adopt anything important. The civil rights legislation of the 1960s was adopted after weeks of debate, a filibuster that lasted weeks, with numerous cloture votes, because it was important legislation. 
   Let me say this about our chairman: He is absolutely correct that he felt that his responsibility was such that he had to bring a bill to the floor. He made the judgment, as he indicated, and it was a good faith judgment. I may disagree with him, which I do, but I don't in any way disagree with the fact that the chairman made a good faith judgment that it was necessary to drop this language because the House would not accept it. And even though I disagree with it and think we should have put this language in here and let someone filibuster, nonetheless, I surely agree that as always he acts in the best of faith.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank him for his contribution to this debate, so many debates of this body. 
   I am going to be briefer than I had actually planned to because our good friends from Alabama and Kansas have been waiting for some time. I do want to spend a couple more minutes. 
   One of the items in this conference report which should be noted is the fact that we have agreed to the language in the Senate bill that would replace the Army's School of the Americas with a new Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. This new institute is going to provide professional education and training to military personnel, law enforcement personnel, and civilian officials of Western Hemisphere countries in areas such as leadership development, counterdrug operations, peace support operations, disaster relief, and human rights. 
   The legislation specifies that the curriculum of this institution include mandatory instruction for each student of a minimum of 8 hours of instruction on human rights, the rule of law, on due process, on civilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a democratic society. In a very significant addition, we have a Board of Visitors, which includes, among others, four Members of Congress and six members from academia, the religious community, and the human rights community, to review the institute's curriculum and its instruction. The Board of Visitors will submit an annual report to the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the Secretary of State, will submit an annual report to Congress on the operation of the institute. 
   I am hoping that this will be a positive, new chapter and that some of the controversial history of the School of the Americas can now be, in fact, in the history books and that we can turn to a new approach in terms of our relationship with the leadership, both civilian and military, in the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere. 
   We have some important beliefs that we want to share with others in democratic societies about civilian control of the military and human rights. These and other subjects, such as due process, are vital to us and, we believe, vital to the success of any democratic institution. They have been under challenge, under stress in too many countries in the Western Hemisphere. They have been too often violated. We have a positive role to play in this area. This provision, particularly now with the kind of Board of Visitors we are going to have that includes members of the religious community, human rights communities, and Members of Congress, I think is now going to make it possible for us to have a new Western Hemisphere Institute which is going to have a proud record of achievement. 
   Second, the bill contains an amendment that I offered to prohibit DOD from selling to the general public any armor-piercing ammunition or armor-piercing components that may have been declared excess to the Department's needs. This prohibition was enacted on a one-year basis in last year's Defense Appropriations Act, and Senator DURBIN has introduced a bill in the Senate to make the ban permanent. There is no possible justification for selling armor-piercing ammunition to the general public, and I am pleased that we have taken this step toward enacting the ban into permanent law. 
   Third, the conferees rejected House language that would have effectively restricted the bidding when DoD privatizes its utility to the sole utility authorized by a state government to operate in that particular area. The conference agreement requires competitive bidding, with a level playing field for all bidders, when DoD privatizes these assets, and allows DoD to determine the rates they will pay after privatization as a matter of contract rather than by state regulation. The conference agreement also protects people on military installations by requiring DoD to enforce prevailing health and safety standards. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill as far as it goes. But I am deeply disappointed, however, by the failure of the conference to include several important provisions that were added in the Senate. 
   First, I am disappointed that conferees refused to include title XV of the Senate bill--the Kennedy hate crimes legislation--in the conference report despite the clear support of a majority of both Houses for this legislation. 
   Hate crimes are a special threat in a society founded on ``liberty and justice for all.'' Too many acts of violent bigotry in recent years have put our nation's commitment to fairness to all our citizens in jeopardy. When Matthew Shepard, a gay student was severely beaten and left for dead or James Byrd, Jr., was dragged to his death behind a pick-up truck, it was not only destructive of the victims and their families, but threatens more broadly to others, and to the victims' communities, and to our American ideals. 
   When a member of the Aryan Nations walked into a Jewish Community Center day school and fired more than 70 rounds from his Uzi submachine gun, and then killed a Filipino-American federal worker because he was considered a ``target of opportunity,'' it not only affected the families of the victims and their communities, but the broad group of which they were a part of. 
   The conferees had an opportunity to address this problem and send a message that America is an all-inclusive nation--one that does not tolerate acts of violence based on bigotry and discrimination. Sadly, we failed to do so. 
   Despite a 232-192 vote in the House of Representatives instructing the conferees to adopt the Senate provision, the House majority refused. And then despite a 57-42 vote in the Senate to make the hate crimes legislation part of the bill, the Senate conferees voted 11-9 to drop the legislation. 
   Mr. President, this issue will not go away. If this Congress will not pass legislation addressing the acts of hatred and violence that terrorize Americans every day, I am confident that another Congress will, and I will continue to work toward that objective. 
   The Senate bill also included landmark legislation authored by Senator CLELAND that would have permitted our men and women in uniform to extend the benefits of the GI bill to family members in appropriate circumstances, and would have addressed an inequity toward disabled veterans by eliminating the requirement that disability pay be deducted dollar-for-dollar from retirement pay. I am disappointed that we were unable to find a way to include these important provisions. 
   Overall, however, this is a bill which should become law. Once again, I want to thank our chairman, Senator WARNER, all of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the staff on both sides of the aisle, for their long hours of hard work on this legislation. I hope the Senate will join us in passing this bill and sending it to the President for signature. 
   I thank my good friend, the chairman of the committee, for his fine leadership, and all the members of the committee and our staffs. 
   I yield the floor.

On the other hand, I do not know where that leaves us in terms of this unanimous consent agreement. And if I could complete my thought, everyone reasonably wants to have some idea as to when the votes will begin, and to a large extent that is going to depend upon Senator GRAMM's decision of how much time he wants to use of his time. 
   I want to, as a factual matter, see if my good friend from Virginia has the same understanding. Both of us have time remaining, I believe, on our time.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at some point there will be a vote on a waiver of the Budget Act for that purpose--I don't want to estimate the number of billions because I am not privy to it--but for a significant amount of money. I want to put that in this context. This is not going to be the last time this year that there is going to be a vote on whether to waive the Budget Act because the ceiling is exceeded. 
   I fully agree with Senator DOMENICI. I couldn't agree more in terms of what his comment was about Senator KERREY's instincts. As always, he seems to me honest and open. That is what this point of order is going to force. Even though I will 
   vote for waiving the Budget Act--I am going to vote that way on this point of order--I must say that I think it is very important that this point of order be made. It is so important that if Senator KERREY had not made it, I was going to make it, because I think the Senate has got to understand what we are doing. I think we are doing the right thing. But we are not going to be doing it quietly in a closed way, which is hidden. We are going to be doing it openly or we are not going to do it at all. Maybe there will not be enough votes to do it at all. 
   But the important point that Senator KERREY and others are making, it seems to me, No. 1, is in their judgment we should not do it. That is the matter of disagreement. But where I think there is agreement is when we do it and when we consider it, we should not be burying it in some bill that nobody knows about. That is why this point of order is valuable, in my judgment. 
   I thank the Senator for his comments. 
   One other point: That the size of this item is a 10-year item. The question I asked the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, was approximately how much will the appropriations bills for just 1 year go above the budget ceiling and discretionary spending. It is that figure which perhaps by the end of the evening I can try to get an estimate of from the staff of the Appropriations Committee. But it will be a significant amount. We are going to have to vote on it. I hope we vote on that explicitly. I hope we vote on that in that final appropriations bill just as openly as we are going to vote on this. I hope it is not just going to be buried in the final appropriations bill and fly through here without a conscious decision on whether or not to waive the Budget Act. Otherwise, there is no fiscal discipline at all. If it is not done openly, there will be even less fiscal discipline. 
   I want my comments to go against my time, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 contains direct spending that far exceeds the Armed Services Committee's allocation of mandatory spending under the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, this conference report would increase mandatory spending by over $19 billion over the next 5 years, and by $61 billion over the next 10 years. 
   Most of this increased spending is for the new ``Medigap'' entitlement for Medicare-eligible military retirees. This new benefit would add $18.7 billion in new direct spending over the next 5 years, and $59.9 billion in new direct spending over the next 10 years. This year's congressional budget resolution established a $400 million reserve fund for mandatory spending on military health care benefits over the next 5 years; the mandatory spending on health care in this conference report would exceed that allowance by $18.3 billion. 
   The net cost to the federal budget is somewhat less, because current, discretionary spending must be subtracted out. While the net cost to the federal budget--that is, the amount of the projected future surpluses that these health care benefits would consume--is somewhat smaller, it is still a very substantial amount of money. The health care provisions in this conference report, when both the mandatory and discretionary components are added together and the costs that are moved from one category to another are netted out, would require $14 billion of new spending over the next 5 years and $40 billion of new spending over the next 10 years. That is a lot of money. 
   This new spending was not contemplated in this year's congressional budget resolution. When Congress enacted the budget resolution earlier this year, we provided only $400 million for new military health care benefits over the next 5 years. So this conference report contains over $13.6 billion over the amount of direct spending on health care that was approved in the budget resolution. 
   I support the new medical benefits provided by this conference report. I support them because I believe that it is incumbent upon the Congress to answer the call of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to address shortcomings in the health care that we provide for our military personnel, military retirees, and their families. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton, told the Armed Services Committee earlier this year.  
   For years our recruiters have promised health care for life for career members and their families. As we all know, that is not what they receive. ..... Keeping our promise of ensuring quality health care for military retirees is not only the right thing to do, it also is a pragmatic decision because it sends a strong signal signal to all those considering a career in uniform.  
   General Shelton went on to point out that we have actual recruiting posters that specifically state that military members and their families would receive health care for life. That, he said, is ``basically what we committed to at the time they were recruited to the armed forces.'' 
   Last year, we enacted pay and retirement reform provisions to send a strong message that we recognize the demands that we place on our men and women in uniform, the circumstances in which they must live and work, and the fact that we often pay them less, and expect them to do far more, than employes in the private sector. The health care provisions in this year's bill should send an equally strong message, and will hopefully have an equally strong positive impact on military recruitment and retention. 
   I believe that providing these health care benefits is the right thing to do, and that we should use the waiver open to us to provide them. At the 
   same time, however, Senator KERREY has done the right thing in raising a point of order relative to these provisions under the Budget Act. We have the responsibility, if we are going to spend tens of billions of dollars on a new benefit, to do so openly and in accordance with our budget rules. Those rules allow us to exceed the spending limits we set for ourselves should we deem it wise and prudent to do so. 
   We do so by voting to waive the Budget Act. That is our way of standing up openly and acknowledging what we are doing, acknowledging that we are about to use some of our surplus for a benefit that was not included in the fiscal plan the Congress adopted in April. We owe it to ourselves and our constituents to be willing to stand up and say either we think this is a good idea worth doing and we should waive the Budget Act, or to say we shouldn't be doing this and voting not to waive it. 
   There is one other significant new entitlement in this conference report and that is the compensation program for contract and federal employees of the Department of Energy who became ill due to their exposure to radiation, beryllium, or other hazardous materials while working to build our nuclear weapons. While much less expensive than the health care benefit, this compensation program also entails direct spending of $1.1 billion over 5 years, and $1.6 billion over 10 years, that was not provided for in the Budget Resolution. As with the health coverage for our military retirees, I think this is the right thing to do, but we have to be willing to waive the Budget Act to do it. 
   Either this bill is wrong, or the congressional budget resolution was wrong in the limitations that it placed on Federal spending. In my view, the problem is not with this bill, but with the budget resolution itself, which was never realistic in the amount of money that it provided for this and other purposes. I believe that the American people would want us to provide improved access to health care and a comprehensive pharmacy benefit for military retirees--and that they would want us to take similar action on behalf of other retirees. 
   Others may disagree, but we cannot have it both ways. We cannot say that we support the strict spending limits in the congressional budget resolution and that we also support the new entitlement programs in this conference report, which would violate those spending limits. The two are inconsistent, and we must make a choice. That is what this vote is about. 
   I commend Senator KERREY for raising a point of order under the Budget Act. For the reasons that I have stated, I will vote to waive the point of order and allow this conference report--and the new benefits that it includes--to become law. 
   I again quote from the testimony of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he told us earlier this year:  
   For years our recruiters promised health care for life for career members and their families. As we all know, that is not what they receive....... Keeping our promise of ensuring quality health care for military retirees is not only the right thing to do, it also is a pragmatic decision because it sends a strong signal to all those considering a career in uniform.  
   Last year, we increased the retirement benefit to where it previously had  been 10 years before when we said it would be 50 percent of your base pay when you retire, rather than the 40 percent which it had been reduced to 15 years ago. We did not make that subject to people's earnings. There is no earnings test. That was an entitlement. It was a retirement benefit. It was a recruiting aid. It was a retention aid. So is this. 
   Most important, it is keeping a commitment which has been made to the people who joined the service. I know very well Senator KERREY did not join for that purpose. Indeed, many do not join for that purpose. But the expert recruiters and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs tell us this is a very important recruiting and retention tool, No. 1. No. 2, it keeps a commitment which has been made, and when the Government makes that commitment, we should keep it. Whether or not the private company keeps it or not, we may not have any control over it. Senator KERREY raised the question of what happens if a private company breaks a commitment. That is very different from when we, the people, make a commitment to our men and women in the military.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate completes action on this important legislation, I want to again congratulate the chairman of the Committee, Senator WARNER, for his leadership and determination in completing this important bill. 
   I also want to thank and congratulate all of the members of the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this bill over the past year. The subcommittee chairpersons and ranking members carried the brunt of the workload in conference, but the fact is that every member of the committee played an active and constructive role in this legislation, from the committee and subcommittee hearings in the spring to the committee markup, to floor action and finally in conference. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to say a special word of thanks to the staff of the Armed Services Committee. The majority staff under the capable leadership of Les Brownlee works very cooperatively with the minority staff under David Lyles. The Committee's long tradition of bipartisanship among the members extends to the staff as well. They truly work together as a single team for the benefit of the men and women of the armed forces and for the national security of our nation. 
   In addition to David Lyles, I want to thank all of the members of the Armed Services Committee minority staff for their efforts this year: Peter Levine, Rick DeBobes; Richard Fieldhouse;  Creighton Greene; Mike McCord; Gary Leeling; Dan Cox; Chris Cowart; and Jan Gordon. I also want to recognize the efforts of the associate staff members of all of the Democratic members of the committee for their efforts this year.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge a distinguished public servant and tireless advocate for our nation's cities, Ben Johnson. The people in my hometown of Detroit, Michigan, realize that ours is a nation of cities. Later this month, many individuals will gather there to celebrate the career of this man who devoted his life to ensuring that all Americans are able to share in our nation's wealth and prosperity. 
   Ben Johnson has dedicated his professional life to expanding opportunity for all Americans. For over two decades, he has tirelessly worked to assist communities, particularly minority communities, in their efforts to fully participate in the pursuit of the American dream. 
   Since 1993, Mr. Johnson has honorably served in the Clinton Administration. During his tenure in this Administration, he worked in the Office of Public Liaison, and served as both a Special and a Deputy Assistant to the President. Currently, Ben Johnson serves as the Assistant to the President and Director of The White House Office on the President's One America Initiative. The One America Initiative office he oversees is the first freestanding White House office established to close opportunity gaps that exist for minorities and the underserved in this nation. In all of these capacities, he has shown a steadfast commitment to ensure economic opportunities for all people. 
   Serving in the Clinton Administration was not Mr. Johnson's first job at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. During the Carter Administration he was Director of Consumer Programs and Special Assistant to Esther Peterson, the Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs. In the years between his service at the White House, Mr. Johnson served in a variety of capacities within the District of Columbia's city government, and worked to ensure that the residents of our nation's capital lived in an efficient, safe and clean city. 
   Ben Johnson can take pride in his long career of service and dedication to assisting minorities and the underserved in our nation. He has been a vocal advocate for the people of Detroit and all the United States. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting Ben Johnson, and in wishing him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up and voting on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act Conference Report, which includes the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. I commend the sponsors of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 women and children are trafficked in the United States every year, many of whom are sexually exploited and forced into involuntary servitude. This bill will provide a comprehensive approach to prevent trafficking as well as ensure vigorous prosecution of those involved in this deplorable practice. 
   I am also pleased that this bill includes the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which has provided an unparalleled level of support for programs to end domestic and sexual violence. VAWA grants have made it possible for communities across the nation to provide shelter and counseling for hundreds of thousands of women and their children. Since 1995, more than $1.5 billion has been appropriated under VAWA's grant programs. Michigan has been awarded about $50 million in Federal grants under VAWA. Those grants provided invaluable resources to survivors of domestic and sexual violence in Michigan. For example, Rural grants have permitted 12 rural counties in Michigan to hire full time advocates for providing services to victims through outreach programs. VAWA Civil Legal Assistance Grants have allowed more than 5 Michigan communities to develop Civil Legal Assistance Programs, which provide quality legal assistance to hundreds of women and children. In addition, 35 Sexual Assault Services Programs and more than 20 Sexual Assault Prevention Programs have been created or strengthened in our state as a direct result of VAWA. 
   Furthermore, VAWA has been tremendously successful in the training of judges, court personnel, prosecutors, police and victims' advocates. Mary Keefe, Executive Director of the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, explained in a letter to me that ``with the heightened training of police, prosecutors, and other in the criminal justice field, many of these systems are now routinely referring the victims they encounter to domestic violence and rape crisis programs.'' 
   VAWA programs have been especially important to women in rural communities, where support networks had been limited due to distance. Here is just one case of such a victim--forwarded to me from the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence--whose life was possibly saved by a VAWA grant.  
   ``Jamie'' (not her real name) was referred to the Domestic Violence Program by the Prosecutor. Jamie had shared with the prosecutor that she was ``afraid for life,'' and that she was afraid to participate in prosecution because of repercussions she may have to bear from her assailant. She soon fell out of contact with the prosecutor and the case against her assailant was on shaky ground. 
   The county prosecutor referred Jamie to the VAWA funded advocate. She came to the program in January, reluctant and fearful, but open to talking to the advocate. The advocate was able to provide two full days of intensive interaction with this survivor. Counseling her, preparing a safety plan for her and her children, telling her how the legal system works and preparing her for what she could expect each step of the way. 
   The advocate was actually able to pick Jamie up, drive her to court each time, sit by her, reassure her throughout the process, listen to her when she was angry and fearful, explain what was going on, and nurture her through the process of being a witness to this case. 
   The perpetrator was eventually convicted on several counts, and is serving time in the County jail.  
   Jamie has begun picking up the pieces of her life and is hopefully on the road to safety.  
   Despite the successes of VAWA, almost 900,0000 women continue to be victims of domestic violence each year, making it the number one health risk for women between the ages of 15 and 44. This Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization will build on the successes of VAWA by more than doubling the amount available for programs to support women and children subject to domestic abuse. 
   Although I support the underlying Trafficking Victims Protection Act, I am concerned about a provision in this bill referred to as Aimee's Law. When the Senator from Pennsylvania introduced this provision as an amendment to he juvenile justice bill, I was one of the few who voted against it. I understand the positive motive of those who support this provision and I agree that we should act to limit the number of tragedies that occur when persons convicted of serious offenses are paroled and then subsequently commit the same offense, but I do not support this unworkable procedure. 
   I remain concerned that this bill will federalize state criminal court systems. Currently, the crimes covered in this bill are defined differently in different states, which is appropriate since the 50 state court systems handle 95 percent of all criminal cases in this country. It is inappropriate to apply federal definitions and federal sentencing guidelines to criminal cases tried in state courts. I also remain concerned about how the penalties will be imposed since the average terms of imprisonment imposed by states are different than actual lengths of imprisonment and the cost of incarceration can not be known unless one can predict life expectancy. 
   On balance, I will vote for this Conference Report because I strongly support the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and Violence Against Women Act.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to acknowledge a distinguished public servant, from my home state of Michigan, Judge Roman S. Gribbs, who will be retiring from the bench of the Michigan Court of Appeals, at the close of this year. In November, hundreds of his colleagues, friends and family will celebrate the career of this gentleman of the bench who played a distinct role in shaping Michigan's history. 
   Judge Gribbs dedicated his academic and professional life to studying, teaching, enforcing, practicing and interpreting the laws that govern the citizens of Michigan. He excelled in his studies at the University of Detroit where he received his Juris Doctorate in 1954, graduating Magna Cum Laude. He taught at his alma mater from 1954 through 1956 and served as an Adjunct Professor and Faculty member at the University of Michigan and the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. He implemented the law as an Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor from 1956 through 1964 and in his service to the City of Detroit as presiding Traffic Court Referee. 
   In 1968, Roman Gribbs' career in the law took a new turn when he was appointed, then elected, Sheriff of Wayne County. His commitment to strong and fair enforcement of the law earned him respect far beyond the boundaries of Michigan's most populous county. 
   In 1969, Sheriff Gribbs was elected mayor of the city of Detroit, just 2 years after the city had endured one of the most destructive civil disturbances in the Nation's history. Under his leadership, the people of Detroit began to heal the city's wounds, to bridge their differences and to build their common future. As a newly elected member of Detroit's City Council in those years, I can testify with first hand knowledge to the debt this great American city owes to the calm, determined leadership of Mayor Roman Gribbs. 
   After stepping down as mayor, Roman Gribbs followed his love for the law and won a seat on the bench of the Third Judicial Circuit and then on the Michigan Court of Appeals where he has served the people of Michigan with a high standard of ethics and courage. 
   In addition to being a dedicated man of the bench, Judge Gribbs also finds solace in his involvement in the arts. His interest in the humanities and the cultural arts is evidenced through his service as a member of the Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of Art, the Detroit Historical Society and the Michigan Opera Theater. 
   Despite all that Judge Gribbs has accomplished in a life of service to others those of us fortunate enough to have enjoyed his friendship may admire him most for the quiet qualities we have seen in him over many years--his unyielding integrity, his uncommon decency and perhaps most amazingly, given the tumultuous times he has lived in, his gentleness. 
   Judge Gribbs can take pride in his long career of service and dedication to the law and to the people of Michigan. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting this man from Michigan, and in wishing him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in recent years, lobbyists for the National Rifle Association, NRA, have been pressing state legislatures around the country to pass so called ``shall issue'' laws. ``Shall issue'' laws require that licensing authorities shall or must issue concealed weapons permits to those who meet standard eligibility requirements. The state laws take discretion away from local law enforcement agencies, who would ordinarily use their own criteria to determine who should carry a concealed weapon. 
   When such a law was proposed in my home state of Michigan, every major law enforcement organization in the state spoke out against it. Athletes, entertainers, religious leaders and some lawmakers joined them in their public plea to keep concealed firearms off our streets. In the end, although both the State House and Senate passed the ``shall issue'' legislation, lawmakers yielded to public pressure and refused to proceed to a conference committee, thereby rejecting the law. 
   While Michigan's citizens acted quickly to ensure that lawmakers rejected the NRA backed proposal, other state legislatures embraced the law as their own. This week the Los Angeles Times published an extensive report on the effects of the relatively new law that gives Texans the right to carry concealed weapons into public places, including churches, hospitals, nursing homes, and amusement parks. The Times story reveals that since the ``shall issue'' law's inception in 1995,  and its expansion in 1997, Texas has issued concealed weapons permits to more than 400 criminals with prior convictions, and has since arrested more than 3,000 licensees. 
   Based on the LA Times investigation, it appears that the law billed as part of an ``anti-crime'' package could really be more accurately described as pro-crime. A recently released study from the Violence Policy Center disclosed that Texans with concealed-carry licenses were 66 percent more likely to be arrested for firearms violations than Texans who did not have such licenses. 
   The LA Times story explains that part of the problem is that in many cases, concealed permits were given to those whose records should have disqualified them. Perhaps the most disturbing case is that of Terry Gist, also known to his friends as ``Holsters'' because of his well-known affection for guns. Before he even applied for his permit to carry a concealed weapon in Texas in 1997, Gist had already been to court for trying to choke his wife and threaten her with a gun (she had a restraining order out against him) and arrested while in the army for brandishing his handgun at a local citizen in Haiti. After he passed the state background check and received his concealed weapons permit in the mail, he was known to carry two semiautomatic handguns, sometimes three, with him at all times. Gist bragged that he displayed one of those guns to a driver during a ``freeway feud.'' In 1998, Gist was arrested and convicted for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl who said during the trial that she was afraid he was going to shoot her. 
   The most common category of problems associated with concealed weapons holders, however, are not those of Terry Gist, but those of people like Paul Leuders. Leuders, a Houston computer analyst, became so upset when he almost missed his bus that the concealed weapons licensee took out his gun and shot the bus driver in the chest. 
   Law abiding citizens, armed with concealed weapons, are too often turning what would otherwise be unpleasant but not catastrophic events, such as fender-benders and commuting hassles, into tragedies. The ``shall issue'' laws in Texas and in states around the country don't make us safer, they make us less secure. In addition, they send the wrong message to our children, that the way to deal with the problems of modern life is with a gun. People around the country reject the NRA logic that they are unsafe in public places if they are not armed. Legislatures should do the same. 
   America has come a long way since the days of the wild west. Over the last years our law enforcement agencies have developed better ways to reduce violent crime and keep our streets safe. ``Shall issue'' laws go in the wrong direction by increasing the number of weapons on the streets and the dangers we and our children face.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now approved an increase in the total number of H-1B nonimmigrant visas made available to skilled foreign workers. 
   I supported that increase because I believe it will help meet this country's growing demand for people with high skills, particularly in fast growing industries such as the high technology industry. However, I want to make clear that I understand this bill to be a short-term fix for the needs of our economy and not a long-term solution. 
   If Congress is going to deal with the workforce needs in this country we can not simply rely on the H-1B program. The national skill shortage problem must be resolved by expanding training programs for American workers and increasing educational opportunities for our young people. 
   Section 10 of this bill provides significant new resources for funding new innovative activities in K-12 math and science across the nation. It also represents a major boost beyond what was provided in the H-1B legislation in 1998.  Under the 1998 H-1B bill, the amount of funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) K-12 activities was fairly small--less than $6 million in FY 2000. Thanks to the leadership of Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator KENNEDY, this legislation would more than double that amount to $15 million. 
   We can make further progress in our education and training needs by increasing the fee that sponsors pay for H-1B visas. Hopefully, the Conference Committee will increase the fee to $1000 more than tripling the amount made available for job training grants, low income scholarships and NSF enrichment courses--opportunities, which in the long-term, will produce a better trained American workforce. The bill before us today does not increase the fee because the Senate can not originate a revenue measure. However, I supported the bill because of a commitment made by both Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to increase the fee to $1000 when the bill goes to conference with the House. 
   The focus on technology training for teachers addresses a critical need, one that I've fought for in my home state of Michigan. That is why I'm happy to note that we've included language in this bill, which I proposed, with the support of Senator CONRAD, specifying that the NSF should make teacher training in the integration of technology into the math and science curriculum a priority in funding projects from resources provided under this legislation. My office will be working with the National Science Foundation as they develop programs to be funded under this legislation so that investments in such professional development will lead the list of funding initiatives. 
   This provision is essential if we are going to realize the full potential of our investment in new technology in the classroom. So few of our school districts have been able to offer state-of-the-art training, or any training at all for that matter, to their teaching staff. Last year, a report by Education Week's National Survey of Teachers' Use of Digital Content revealed some startling findings relative to the lack of teacher training in integrating technology into the curriculum. In a national poll of over 1,400 teachers, 36 percent of teachers responded that they received absolutely no training in integrating technology in the curriculum; another 36 percent said they had only received 1 to 5 hours of such training; 14 percent received 6 to 10 hours of such training; and only 7 percent received between 11-20 hours. 
   This bill is an important step towards addressing this problem, a step that I hope is followed by many others. We are fortunate in my state and across this country to find in the ranks of teachers men and women who are deeply committed to helping America's children learn. I believe we have to match their commitment to our children with our own commitment to helping them acquire the skills they seek to be effective educators in the digital age. 
   I also supported this bill because it guarantees that H-1B visas will be made available to those working at educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and non-profit or governmental research organizations. Currently, these institutions, who recruit scholars and researchers with the highest possible credentials, are forced to compete with for profit companies for the limited number of visas available, and have had difficulties obtaining H-1B visas for their prospective employees. 
   Some of those visa holders are people like Thomas Hofweber, a first-year assistant professor in the Philosophy Department at the University of Michigan, who has conducted research in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology and is believed to be among the most talented young metaphysicians in the world. Another H-1B visa holder at Michigan State University's Department of Agricultural Economics is a researcher and teacher in Agribusiness Management and brings an outstanding background in the economics of horticultural enterprises and the management of their labor forces. 
   It is of great benefit for Michigan students to be able to study with these scholars. I am pleased that universities and research institutions will be able to obtain more needed visas under this bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate today will vote on the confirmation of a number of judicial nominees. I not only have no problem with that, I very much favor it. These nominees deserve a vote. The districts in which they will serve surely deserve to have their nominations acted upon. I believe the Nation, as a whole, deserves to have these nominees, and other nominees awaiting hearings and votes acted on by this Senate as well. 
   The Judiciary Committee held hearings for three of the nominees and approved those nominations less than a week after the nominations were received. Other nominees wait in vain for years just for a hearing. That strikes me as being an arbitrary and inexplicable system, unfair to nominees awaiting hearings, awaiting votes, and unfair to the districts or the circuits in which they would serve if confirmed. I believe it is also unfair--perhaps this is most important of all--to the people who await justice in their courts. 
   Two Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit have been waiting unsuccessfully for a hearing for more than 3 1/2 years and 1 year respectively. Two women, highly qualified, nominated from Michigan for the Sixth Circuit where there is a severe shortage of judges and an enormous caseload that sits there pending, while they have been waiting for more than 3 1/2 years and 1 year respectively. 
   Judge Helene White, who is a court of appeals judge in Michigan, was first nominated in January of 1997. Her nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has never been acted upon. She has never been granted a hearing. 
   Kathleen McCree Lewis was nominated to the Sixth Circuit over a year ago. It has been pending before the Judiciary Committee for over a year. No hearing, no action. 
   These are two judicial nominees from my home State of Michigan. Despite there being no objection that I know of to their nominations, and in the absence of any explanation whatsoever, they have been kept in limbo without even a hearing for 3 1/2 years and 1 year respectively. I believe that is truly unconscionable. In the history of the Senate, no nominee has waited as long as Judge White for a confirmation hearing. The seat that she has been nominated for has been vacant for 5 1/2 years. It is considered a ``judicial emergency'' by the Judicial Conference of the United States. 
   There is no apparent reason for the denial of hearings for these two nominees. No one has questioned their qualifications for the bench. No one that I know of objects to their candidacies. It is well known Judge White and Ms. Lewis are both talented, hard-working nominees. 
   Each are highly respected for their records which show them to be women of integrity and fairness. Judge White has had a distinguished career. She was a trial judge for 10 years on the Wayne County Circuit Court bench and in 1992 was elected to the Michigan Court of Appeals where she has served ever since. She also serves on the board of directors of the Michigan Legal Services and the board of governors of the American Jewish Committee. 
   Kathleen McCree Lewis is a distinguished appellate practitioner at the Detroit law firm of Dykema Gossett, one of the most prestigious law firms in our State. She also served as a commissioner on the Detroit Civil Service Commission and on the Civic Center Commission. She has argued dozens of cases and is a respected appellate lawyer in the very circuit to which she has been nominated. She also happens to be the daughter of the late Wade McCree, a highly respected judge who served on the Sixth Circuit, and was a former Solicitor General of the United States. If confirmed, Kathleen McCree Lewis will be the first African American woman ever to serve on the Sixth Circuit. 
   Gov. George Bush has said that the Senate should act on nominees within 60 days. That deadline passed years ago for Judge White and for Kathleen McCree Lewis. According to Governor Bush:  
   The Constitution empowers the President to nominate officers of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  
   Then he said:  
   That is clear-cut, straightforward language. It does not empower anyone to turn  the process into a protracted ordeal of unreasonable delay and unrelenting investigation.  
   To keep these nominees pending for so long without hearings is unfair to the nominees, particularly where there is no known objection and where there is no explanation for the refusal to grant hearings. 
   Even more important, it is unfair to the citizens served by the court. There is a large backlog of cases in the Sixth Circuit which is a serious concern for not just Michigan but for all the States that are served by that court. Over one-fourth of the judgeships on the Sixth Circuit are currently vacant, and that is among the highest vacancy rate of any circuit court in the country. 
   Judge Gilbert Merritt, who recently served as chief judge of the Sixth Circuit, wrote in a March 20 letter to Chairman HATCH: The court is ``hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its workload due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to our court.'' 
   Judge Merritt went on to say the following--and this is the former chief judge who still sits on the court. This is what Judge Merritt said:  
   Our court should not be treated in this fashion. The public's business should not be treated this way. The litigants in the Federal courts should not be treated this way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated this way. The situation in our court is rapidly deteriorating due to the fact that 25 percent of the judgeships are vacant. Each active judge of our court is now participating in deciding more than 550 cases a year--a caseload that is excessive by any standard. In addition, we will have almost 200 death penalty cases that will be facing us before the end of the next year. 
   The Founding Fathers certainly intended the Senate ``advise'' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, debate and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider any vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, understaffed and unable to properly carry out their responsibilities for years.  
   That is Judge Merritt's letter. In addition to that, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator HATCH, received a letter from 
   14 former presidents of the State bar of Michigan. These include, by the way, Democrats and Republicans. That letter pleads for action relative to the situation on the Sixth Circuit. 
   The Michigan bar presidents wrote in their letter to Senator HATCH that the state of affairs on the Sixth Circuit has ``serious adverse effects on the bar and the administration of justice for our clients. We urge you to promptly schedule hearings for, and to pass to the Senate floor for a vote, the nominations of Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis.'' 
   In the last few months, there have also been several articles and editorials in papers around Michigan calling on the Senate to confirm the court of appeals nominees for Michigan. 
   An editorial in the Detroit Free Press said:  
   The Senate's delay in considering President Clinton's nominations to the [Sixth Circuit] court is unfair to Michigan, to the nominees, and to anyone whose future might be affected by a decision of this court.  
   An editorial in the Observer and Eccentric newspapers urged the Judiciary Committee and its members to ``give two thoughtful and well-respected Michigan lawyers the courtesy of timely hearings on their nominations to the Federal judiciary that is currently hamstrung in carrying out its work.'' 
   An editorial in the Detroit News described the failure to act on Sixth Circuit nominees as ``the sort of die-hard intransigence that should be out of bounds.'' 
   And a Jewish News editorial called the stall a ``travesty of justice.'' 
   If Senators have concerns about something in the records of these Michigan candidates--and no one has raised anything to that effect--then Senators should air their concerns in a committee hearing and then let the committee vote. It is unfair to Michigan, it is unfair to the citizens who use this court to keep these judicial nominees endlessly in limbo, despite the absence of any objection that I know of to their nominations and with no explanation forthcoming whatsoever. 
   A number of us have spent many hours over the last few years trying to get hearings for these Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals nominees from Michigan, and yet two well-qualified candidates, each deserving a hearing and a Senate vote, have been left in limbo with no explanation, no stated objection. 
   What we are doing today in approving these four nominees, it seems to me, is surely our function, totally appropriate, and I believe and hope the nominees will be confirmed. 
   As we do this, we should also focus on nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, awaiting hearings or awaiting a vote by the committee after a hearing, who are left there no matter how long they have been waiting, sometimes, again, years in the case of Helene White and Barry Goode. We have others who have been waiting since April of last year, June of last year, August of last year, September of last year. I think we can do better than that. We should rise above that kind of nonaction on the part of our Judiciary Committee. 
   No plea from me or from others who have worked with me on these nominations has produced hearings, despite the editorials, despite the letters from the bar associations and from Judge Merritt. Despite all these efforts, we have received just silence and statements about waiting a little longer or ``we'll see'' or ``we'll try.'' 
   We should be better than that. The Constitution wants us to be better than that. I will vote to confirm these nominees whose nominations, in many cases, were sent to the Senate, heard by the Judiciary Committee, and approved by the Judiciary Committee in less than a week. At the same time, I will be thinking of the vacancies that exist on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that have remained unfilled for years, where there is a judicial emergency, an enormous backlog, and where, despite all the pleas from the bar association, the Sixth Circuit, from indeed the Chief Justice of the United States, to vote on confirmations, we have these two well-qualified women from Michigan sitting there, awaiting a hearing, endlessly in limbo, nothing but silence, no explanation as to why their hearings are refused, no objection being noted or stated to their nominations, only two well-qualified women left in limbo and in silence. 
   We can do better. We should do better. I hope we find a way some day to do better. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the following letters and editorials.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is not even one month into the school year and yet school is canceled for the week at Carter C. Woodson Middle School in New Orleans, Louisiana. On Tuesday afternoon, a 13-year-old boy, who had been expelled from school for fighting, allegedly slipped another 13-year-old a .38-caliber revolver. The expelled teen was seen passing the handgun through the school fence to the other 13-year-old, who allegedly used the gun to shoot a 15-year-old schoolmate. According to witnesses, the 15-year-old then managed to get the gun from his attacker and return gunfire.  
   As a result of this school day skirmish, two teenagers have been hospitalized in critical condition and another teen-ager has been booked on charges of illegally carrying a gun and being a principal to attempted first-degree murder. In addition, the 600 student middle school is in a ``cooling off period,'' meaning classes are canceled for the rest of the week. 
   It is deeply disturbing that teen-agers have such easy access to handguns. The laws in this country make it illegal for a juvenile to possess a handgun or a person to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a handgun to a juvenile. Yet, with so many loopholes in our firearm distribution laws, it is easy for prohibited users, such as young people, to find illegal access to thousands of guns. 
   Congress can close those loopholes and act to prevent tragedies like the one in New Orleans. With only one week left until the Senate's target adjournment, the time is now. We must pass sensible gun laws and reduce the threat of gun violence in our schools and communities.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate nears adjournment I want to pay a special tribute to a special member of the Armed Services Committee's Minority staff. After a long and successful career in both the Executive and Legislative Branch, but mostly here in the United States Senate, Jan Gordon will be leaving our staff on November 30. Speaking not only for myself, but on behalf of the entire Committee and our staff, I can tell you that Jan will be sorely missed. 
   A native North Carolinian, in 1972 Jan Gordon was recruited by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to come to Washington, D.C. to work as an executive secretary in their Intelligence Division. While her heart always remained in North Carolina, her feet became firmly planted in Washington. 
   After four years at the FBI, Jan began her Senate career, working first on the staff of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee, and then nine and a half years for the Secretary of the Senate in the Office of National Security Information, which later became what is now the Office of Senate Security. Countless numbers of my colleagues and staff who attended classified briefings or conferences up in S-407 of the Capitol during that period have first hand knowledge of Jan Gordon's superior administrative abilities and organizational skills. 
   In 1987, Chairman Sam Nunn of the Armed Service Committee appointed Jan Gordon as a staff assistant, and she was charged with the very demanding task supporting the staff and work of the Strategic Subcommittee. Not surprisingly, Jan rose to the occasion. She met all of the needs of the Subcommittee, while at the same time she had sole responsibility for the processing and printing of typically 20-25 hearing transcripts per year, many of which were classified. Because her work was so excellent, Jan Gordon was the person Committee's Chief Clerk turned to when new staff assistants needed to be taught ``how to do things the right way.'' 
   When I became Ranking Minority Member of the Committee in 1997 following Senator San Nunn's retirement from the Senate, one of the quickest and easiest decisions I made was to ask Jan to continue working for me and the rest of the Committee's Minority Members and staff. I was delighted that she accepted my offer, because Jan is a valuable and key member of the Minority Staff of the Armed Services Committee. 
   Jan Gordon's service on the staff of the Armed Services Committee has been remarkable. She has an uncompromising work ethic and a strong dedication to duty. Of the over 5,000 days she will have worked for the Armed Services Committee when she retires, she has only had seven sick days. Being late to work, cutting any corner for the sake of moving a project forward, or not being totally cooperative and responsive are foreign and unacceptable concepts to Jan. Her steadfast attention to detail is legendary around the Committee, as is her commitment to meeting the highest standards in everything she does. 
   Jan Gordon has always given completely of herself each and every day of the nearly fourteen years she has served on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. When she departs the Committee staff, all of us will remember her for her professionalism, her enthusiasm, and the consistently high standard she set for herself. We are grateful for her service to the Senate and the Nation, and we wish her many years of health and happiness in the future.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we have before the Senate the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. I had great concern with the amendment offered last week by Senator ABRAHAM because the amendment sought to define terms which could have resulted in  increased domestic diversion of Great Lakes water. This amendment, which was accepted as part of the manager's package until I asked that it be removed, could have led to the opposite of what we need for the Great Lakes. Specially, the amendment as accepted by the managers last week defined bulk fresh water as ``fresh water extracted in amounts intended for transportation outside the United States by commercial vessel or similar form of mass transportation, without further processing.'' This definition could have been interpreted as allowing more diversion of Great Lakes water within the United States. This threat to the Great Lakes was unacceptable and I would have strongly opposed the amendment with that definition. 
   I still have reservations about the amendment because some might try to use it to argue that the current protections against diversions of Great Lakes water provided by existing law are not sufficient. We currently have an effective veto over bulk removals of Great Lakes water outside of the Great Lakes basin. When we passed WRDA in 1986, we acted to make sure that each Great Lakes governor would have a veto over such removals. This protection is legally sufficient and we should do nothing to imply otherwise. 
   If the states formally adopt a conservation strategy and standards, and the governors are currently working on those standards, such standards might provide an additional safeguard to strengthen our position that our current gubernatorial veto policy over bulk removals of Great Lakes water is consistent with the rules of international trade. This conservation strategy and standards might also provide additional protection against removals from the basin. But I favor seeking that additional strength for our position in a way which has no possible implication that it is necessary. While this amendment falls short in this regard, once offered, it would be worse if it were not adopted so I will not object to it.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, American consumers should have access to reasonably priced medicines. That seems like such a simple and reasonable statement to make, yet it is a bold one to make in this Congress. Drug prices should be a central part of the debate. I firmly believe we must do two things relative to prescription drugs (1) add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program and (2) address the high price of drugs. It is the second issue that the bill I am introducing today with Senator BRYAN seeks to address. 
   The Prescription Drug Price Anti-Discrimination Act provides that when a prescription drug manufacturer has a policy that discriminates against U.S. wholesalers by charging them more than it charges foreign wholesalers, a 10 percent discriminatory profits tax would be imposed on that manufacturer. This 10 percent discriminatory profits tax will be dedicated to Part A of the Medicare trust fund. 
   This legislation does not attempt to control drug prices. The manufacturer may charge what it chooses to a foreign wholesaler or a U.S. wholesaler. But if the manufacturer does not have a non-discriminatory pricing policy, the discriminatory profits penalty kicks in. It is up to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer reports that it has a policy to charge U.S. wholesalers no more than foreign wholesalers, there is no penalty. That statement would be attached to the company's tax return, and it would be treated like any other representation on a tax return. 
   This bill applies to U.S. manufacturers distributing to foreign wholesalers in Canada and any country that is a member of the European Union. By limiting the bill to Canada and the European countries, we still allow for prescription drug manufacturers to sell AIDS drugs at lower prices to African countries or other countries ravaged by diseases. The bill refers only to other countries whose resources are comparable to ours. 
   Fortune magazine recently reported that pharmaceuticals ranked as the most profitable industry in the country in three benchmarks-return on revenues, return on assets, and return on equity. Yet, Americans are forced to pay extraordinarily high prices for prescription drugs in the U.S. when they can cross the border to Canada to buy those same drugs at far lower prices. This legislation should help bring Americans the prescription drugs that they need at lower prices. 
   I have come to the Senate floor on previous occasions to talk about my own constituents who travel from Michigan to Canada just to purchase lower priced prescription drugs. We found that seven of the prescription drugs most used by Americans cost an average of 89 percent more in Michigan than in Canada. For example, Premarin, an estrogen tablet taken by menopausal women costs $23.24 in Michigan and $10.04 in Ontario. The Michigan price is 131 percent above the Ontario price. Another example, Synthroid, a drug taken to replace a hormone normally produced by the thyroid gland, costs $13.16 in Michigan and $7.96 in Ontario. The Michigan price is 65 percent above the Ontario price. 
   To add insult to injury, these drugs received financial support from the taxpayers of the United States through a tax credit for research and development and in some cases through direct grants from the NIH to the scientists who developed these drugs. In 1996 (the latest year that we have data) through a variety of tax credits, the industry reduced its tax liability by $3.8 billion or 43 percent. 
   Research is very important and we want pharmaceutical companies to engage in robust research and development. But American consumers should not pay the share of research and development that consumers in other countries should be shouldering. 
   Manufacturers of prescription drugs are spending fortunes for advertising. According to the Wall Street Journal, spending on consumer advertising for drugs rose 40 percent in 1999 compared with 1998. In 1999 the drug industry spent nearly $14 billion on promotion, public relations and advertising. 
   Mr. President, I have been sent a letter from Families USA, a noted health care advocacy group, which states that the bill we are introducing today ``will help Medicare beneficiaries buy drugs at lower prices.'' 
   Our citizens should not have to cross the border for cheaper medicines made in the U.S. U.S. consumers are subsidizing other countries when it comes to prescription drug prices. That is simply wrong and this legislation will help to correct this situation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to the experts, the number of heroin users is on the rise while the average age of first heroin use is dropping. Heroin addiction is a public health crisis of significant proportion. This legislation, the Hatch-Levin Drug Addiction Act, S. 324, will allow us to effectively utilize a new medical discovery of a substance called Buprenorphine, which has proven to be an extraordinarily effective means for combating heroin addiction by blocking the craving for heroin. 
   But this anti-addiction medication can help us win the war against heroin and heroin addiction only if we change our laws so that the medication can be dispensed in physician's offices instead of a centralized clinic. That is what this legislation accomplishes. 
   It is estimated that there are approximately one million heroin addicts in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, many of these heroin addicts want to kick their habit, but do not wish to receive treatment in methadone clinics ``..... because of the stigma of being in methadone treatment or their concerns about the medical effects of methadone.'' 
   The Drug Addiction Treatment Act has now passed the House of Representatives in slightly different form than we passed in the Senate on November 19. Its adoption again by the Senate as Title XXXV, Section 3501 and Section 3502 of the substitute amendment to H.R. 4365, the Children Health Act of 2000, paves the way for physician office-based dispensing of a medication which has been the subject of extensive successful research and clinical trials in the U.S. and France. This medication, Buprenorphine, was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a private pharmaceutical manufacturer, and is expected to receive FDA approval in the weeks ahead. Buprenorphine has already been in use, in physician offices, for a number of years in France, where significant success has been achieved in getting individuals off of heroin, reducing crime and heroin-related deaths. For example, since the introduction of Buprenorphine in France, there has been an 80 percent decline in deaths by heroin overdose--from 505 in 1994 to 92 in 1998; user crime and arrests are down by 57 percent--from 17,356 in 1995 to 7,649 in 1998; and trafficking arrests have declined by 40 percent--from 3,329 in 1995 to 1,979 in 1997. 
   Over a year ago, I introduced the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, S. 324, along with Senator HATCH, Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator BIDEN, in order to put in place the necessary mechanisms to accommodate this revolutionary new treatment that can block the craving for heroin and dramatically restore the quality of the lives of individuals and families who have struggled to get out from under heroin addiction. 
   There are a number of reasons why our legislation is necessary. Under current law, the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, the process by which individual physicians must be approved in order to prescribe narcotics in drug treatment is a cumbersome and complex regulatory process. Federal regulations and State regulations, which could, under existing law, be written to allow Buprenorphine to be utilized in physician offices will take an extensive period of time to be written and take many years to be implemented. Indeed, there is no assurance that such regulations will ever be written by both federal and state governments. In the meantime, a very effective medication is unavailable to those who are addicted to Heroin. 
   The Hatch-Levin legislation would allow for the utilization of Buprenorphine by qualified physicians in a physician's office. It will also assure that Buprenorphine will be made available in every state unless a state expressly opts out of the program through legislation. 
   The current federal regulatory process needed to be utilized before treatment of addiction in an office-based setting is allowed include: (1) Writing the regulations, which could take up to a year or more; (2) Issuance of the proposed rule which would be published in the Federal Register, including the announcement of a period of time for public comment on the proposed rule; (3) A review of the public comments, which could take a year or more; (4) The issuance of the final rule, (5) Then each State is required to affirmatively approve and implement the physician office approach which typically takes 2-4 years, in those states that do act. 
   Based on the experience with the introduction of LAAM for the treatment of heroin addiction--a medication similar to methadone which is effective for up to three days, as opposed to the daily dosage required by methadone--most states may never approve the physician office approach and for those that do the process could go on for as many as 4-5 years. That was the case with California and New York. According to findings reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on July 14, 1999: ``Current federal and state regulations prevent ease of entry into methadone or LAMM maintenance treatment. .....'' 
   So, while it is possible under current law for regulations to be written by HHS allowing for the use of Buprenorphine in the treatment of heroin addiction and to allow for it to be prescribed in physician offices,

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the last several months, many of us here in the Senate have been urging our colleagues to pass sensible gun laws. Each year, more than 30,000 Americans are killed by gunfire (an average of 10 children and adolescents and 74 adult Americans each day) and until we act, thousands more will be lost to gun violence. 
   Those of us who are committed to this issue have pledged to read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 21, 1999: 
   Colden Hurt, 28, Baltimore, MD; 
   Troy Jones, 32, Washington, DC; 
   Billy Peaks, 23, Chicago, IL;

   Charles Walker, 17, St. Louis, MO; 
   Omar Williams, 24, Memphis, TN; 
   Jessie Williamson, 42, Memphis, TN. 
   We cannot allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a painful reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation today.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which provides fair relief to schools in Michigan and other states. 
   In 1993, the state of Michigan and our school districts worked out an agreement which would provide schools a portion of Federal Medicaid dollars based on school based health related activities that were being provided to eligible children receiving special education services. When these school superintendents looked around in 1996, they saw a similarly situated state which was providing administrative services to help special needs kids, and they decided to follow suit for children in Michigan. Michigan then implemented the Administrative Outreach component of school based services based on a program that had been in operation in that state for the previous two years. 
   Recently, HCFA disallowed $103.6 million in claims submitted by the state of Michigan to reimburse the schools for services already rendered in this effort. It is simply unfair that these school districts are now being penalized when they have been trying to provide health services through the schools for special needs kids in ways used in other states and after relying on HCFA regional guidance. 
   I have met with a large group of Michigan school superintendents and their staff and I know how committed they are to helping children with special needs. Apparently, the rules need to be clarified, and in a meeting with HCFA that the Michigan superintendents had this week, HCFA committed to sitting down with the education community by the end of this month to finalize an administrative guide regarding claims for reimbursement. That is surely an appropriate goal, but in the meantime, Michigan claims have been disallowed although the state relied on regional HCFA guidance. While national guidance is being clarified, we should not penalize states who have acted reasonably based on existing guidance. 
   I believe Michigan school superintendents when they say they believed they were acting appropriately in providing services for children with special educational needs. These are honest hardworking people trying to run school districts on tight budgets. I am introducing this legislation because I believe any attempt to penalize schools who acted in good faith will ultimately hurt special needs kids as well as our schools themselves.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are weighty arguments that can be made on both sides of the question regarding whether or not to grant permanent normal trade relations status, PNTR, to China. But in the end there are two compelling arguments for granting PNTR that, I believe outweigh the arguments against it. 
   The first is that our current trade relationship with China is unacceptable and the second is that the existing annual review of our trade relationship has failed to improve either that relationship or the human rights situation in China. Granting China PNTR will result in concrete improvements in our trade relationship and offers the promise of a significantly more effective  tool for both monitoring and changing the human rights conditions in that country. 
   When I say that our trade relationship with China is unacceptable, I am referring to the $69 billion trade deficit with China we ran up last year ($82 billion in imports versus $13 billion in exports). And as bad as that deficit is, economists are predicting it will grow. These levels are totally unacceptable. Today, access to China's highly regulated and protected market is extremely difficult. China protects its domestic market with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers that limit access of foreign companies. There is also inadequate protection of intellectual property and trade-distorting government subsidies. 
   There are clearly some advantages to this agreement in terms of gaining greater access to Chinese markets. China's current trade barriers, for instance, are especially high in the automotive sector. Concessions made by China in the agreement with the United States to open up their automotive sector to our exports are significant, including tariff reductions. Before the agreement, China's auto tariffs average 80-100 percent. China agreed to lower that to 25 percent by 2006. Before the agreement China's tariff on auto parts averages 20-35 percent. That is reduced to 10 percent by 2006 under the agreement. 
   There are significant tariff reductions in other areas than the auto sector. Before the agreement, China's agricultural equipment tariffs average about 11 1/2 percent. China will reduce them to 5.7 percent by 2002. Before the agreement the Chinese tariff on apples, cherries and pears is 70 percent. After the agreement, China will reduce that to 10 percent, by 2004. China's tariff on chemicals averages 14.75 percent now, and in the agreement China has agreed to reduce it to 6.9 percent by 2006. It also agreed to reduce its tariff on filing cabinets from 18 to 10.5 percent by 2003. Chinese tariffs on refrigerators would come down from 25 percent to 20 percent by 2002. American farmers and exporters have told me they believe they can export to and compete in China with these lower tariffs. 
   China has also agreed to phase out its restrictive import licensing requirements and import quotas for vehicles. China agreed to phase out all restrictions on distribution services, such as auto maintenance and repair industries, giving U.S. companies the right to control distribution of their products, which is currently prohibited. In its agreement with the European Union, which will apply to all WTO members once China joins the WTO, China agreed to let foreign auto manufacturers, not the Chinese government, as is currently the case, decide what vehicles they wish to produce for the Chinese market. Also, as a member of the WTO, China would be required to drop its local content restrictions. Such changes are significant and long overdue. 
   If the status quo in our trade with China is unacceptable, so too is our mechanism for impacting the human rights climate in that country. I know that some have argued that Congress should not grant China PNTR status because they are reluctant to abandon our annual human rights review process and thus reduce our leverage with China on human rights practices. But what real leverage has this annual review and certification process given us when the United States has granted China normal trade relations status every year for 21 years without interruption? Even in 1989, after Tiananmen Square, China's normal trade relations, NTR, status was renewed. If we can certify China even after Tiananmen Square, what is this annual review pressure really worth? 
   The human rights situation in China is miserable. That's the current situation, the status quo before the agreement we are considering. Describing the violations of human rights in China now doesn't answer the question of whether we should grant China PNTR any more than whether we should have granted PNTR to Saudi Arabia or other countries where human rights are violated. 
   In other words, the current situation before this agreement is bad regarding human rights as is true with many other countries with whom we have PNTR. I don't see how we are worse off 
   with this agreement in terms of getting China to improve their human rights. In fact, the PNTR bill we are voting on includes a specific mechanism to monitor and report on China's human rights practices that was proposed by my brother, Congressman SANDER LEVIN. Through the establishment of a congressional-executive commission on human rights, labor market issues and the establishment of the rule of law in China we will be keeping some public, visible and ongoing pressure on China to reform in these areas. Even the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, who was critical of the House vote approving PNTR acknowledged that my brother's provisions,  
   ..... marked an historic turning point: a trade bill cannot be passed in Congress anymore unless it addresses human rights and workers' rights.  
   In addition to the improved human rights enforcement we gain under PNTR, I believe it is at least possible the opening of Chinese markets to our products and involving them more and more in the world economy will produce human rights results which the current approach hasn't produced. 
   There may be some truth in the argument that the year-to-year certification creates some uncertainty for American businesses thinking of investing in China if they export some of their Chinese production back here despite their stated intention not to. This uncertainty, it is argued, results in lower levels of US investment in China, and lower levels of job transfers which sometimes accompanies that investment, than would be the case without the tariff uncertainty created by the annual review. However, it's unrealistic to expect that investments will not be made in China by companies from other countries even if not made by our companies. European and Asian companies will presumably fill any gap. And they could just as easily export their Chinese-made products to the United States, in which case more US jobs would probably be displaced as a result of those imports than would be displaced if American companies were the investors. 
   Let's assume you have an American and a German refrigerator manufacturer vying to make refrigerators in China. If both companies were going to ship refrigerators back to the United States, the jobs of people making refrigerators in the United States would seemingly be at least as much jeopardized by the German made-in-China refrigerator as the American made-in-China refrigerator. Actually, the job displacement would probably be less with the American made-in-China refrigerators being sold back here because the American company is more likely to use some US made components, stimulating at least some US exports. And not only will European and Asian businesses probably be less likely to use American made components in items they assemble in China, they will probably have fewer US stockholders gaining from their investments in China than would be the case with an American company's investment. 
   For instance, even though General Motors started production of the Buick Regal two years ago in Shanghai, no GM vehicles have come back to the US and $250 million a year worth of American made auto parts were used in that production. As a result of General Motors and other US vehicle manufacturers' investment in China, in 1999 Chinese imports of US automotive parts grew by 90 percent over the prior year. Percentagewise, China's imports of US automotive parts are increasing faster than China's exports of automotive parts to the United States. We are seemingly better off with some US content in Chinese-made products than with none. 
   It's clear to me that the status quo is failing to improve human rights conditions in China and failing to improve our trade relationship with that country. Given that I believe our trade relationship with China is intolerable and China's human rights climate is miserable, I do not vote for PNTR to reward China. Far from it. I have no desire to reward China for creating unfair barriers to American products and maintaining tariffs on our exports while Chinese imports flood our marketplace. Nor do I want to reward China for its failure to comply with earlier trade agreements. And I have no desire to reward China for persecuting those who only seek to practice their religious beliefs or to secure their rights as workers. But in the end PNTR is not a reward to China, it is a tool our country  should use and use aggressively to open China's markets to our goods the way our market has been open to China's goods and to exert meaningful pressure on China to join that community of nations that respects basic human rights. My vote for PNTR is a vote against a status quo that has failed to advance either of those goals. It is a vote for a measure, however imperfect, that can move us closer to a fair trading relationship with China and to a day when the people of that country can enjoy their fundamental human rights.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a concurrent resolution along with Representative BART STUPAK which recognizes the Native American men and women who have served in the United States military. 
   This resolution recognizes the contributions of Native Americans in the United States Military service which are indeed impressive. Native Americans have served in the United States military since the American Revolution. During the Civil War, there were 3 Confederate units and 1 Union unit primarily made up of Native Americans from the Oklahoma tribes. Many Native Americans fought in the Spanish American War. In fact, one warrior from Michigan, Jonas Shawandase, fought bravely with Teddy Roosevelt on San Juan Hill. 
   In World War I, many Native Americans were so eager to join that they went to Canada to enlist before the United States entered the war. 6,000 of the more than 8,000 who served during this war were volunteers. This tremendous act of patriotism persuaded Congress to pass the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924. During World War II, 25,000 Native American men and women fought on all fronts in Europe and Asia, receiving more than 71 Air Medals, 51 Silver Stars, 47 Bronze Stars, 34 Distinguished Flying Crosses and two Congressional Medals of Honor. In fact Ira  Hayes, a Pima Indian, was one of the men to raise the flag on Iwo Jima. 
   In the Vietnam War more than 41,500 Native Americans served in the United States Armed Forces. Of those, 90% were volunteers, giving Native Americans the highest record of service of any ethnic group in the country. In 1990, prior to Operation Desert Storm, some 24,000 Native American men and women were in the military. Approximately 3,000 served in the Persian Gulf. One of every four Native American males is a military veteran. 
   Native Americans in Michigan have told me that veterans are greatly respected in Native American societies and this honor is nowhere more apparent than at powwows. At a powwow celebration, the veterans are given the honor of carrying the flag and are the first to enter the powwow circle. 
   This resolution recognizes those Native Americans who with dignity served in the U.S. military. We note today their service to this country and honor Native Americans for their military contributions.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, as Ukraine approaches its first decade of independence, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there are many accomplishments which the people of Ukraine can be proud. 
   For over a millennium, the Ukrainian people have successfully preserved and maintained their unique culture, language, religion and identity. Such an achievement stands as an inspiration for free people everywhere, and is a testimony to the depth, character and vibrancy of the Ukrainian culture. 
   The November 14, 1999, re-election of Leonid Kuchna as Ukraine's President is a cause for great optimism. High turnout in this election, and a refusal by the voters to return to a Communist past, speaks to the vibrancy of Ukranian democracy. 
   With this election, the Ukranian people chose to move forward with a program of economic reform. While the transition from a centralized economy to a free-market system has not been easy, Ukraine has been blessed with vast natural resources, a sizeable industrial infrastructure and a hard-working and resourceful people that promise to ensure Ukraine's economic transformation. The decision, this year, by the Supreme Rada to privatize large parts of the Ukrainian economy will further enable this industrious nation to continue with its economic progress. 
   Ukraine's unique geographical location has given it a vital role in ensuring the peace and stability of not only the region, but of all Europe. Ukraine has shown its commitment to a secure Europe by providing troops to the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo, and by seeking to enhance its partnership with NATO. By entering into the Status of Forces Agreement with NATO, and hosting NATO military exercises in Odessa, Ukraine has reiterated its commitment to the world's most powerful military alliance. 
   At this time when we honor Ukraine's independence, it is only fitting that we laud the many advances made by the Ukrainian people in the  past decade. The advances Ukraine has made today are built upon the sacrifices and dedication of countless patriots who have struggled to preserve the independence and freedom of the Ukranian people. I am sure that my Senate colleagues would join me in saluting the Ukranian people for their tremendous courage in promoting free and fair markets and participatory democracy during a difficult transition period.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a new study conducted by researchers at Hamilton College reveals that students across the country are strongly in favor of sensible gun laws. According to the report, approximately ninety percent of high school students surveyed support proposals such as the registration of handguns and licensing of handgun owners, criminal background checks for prospective gun purchasers, and five-day ``cooling off periods.'' In addition, eighty to ninety percent of the teens surveyed in the poll support laws that would require all guns to be sold with trigger locks, require all gun buyers to pass a safety course, and hold adults criminally responsible for keeping a loaded firearm where it could be reasonably accessed by a child and that child harms himself or others. 
   Here are some of the other findings from the report: ``High school students back handgun regulation at higher levels than respondents in recent adult surveys; High school students believe that the Constitution protects the right of citizens to own guns. But they reject the idea that government regulation of the sale and use of handguns violates this right; Almost half of high school students say it would be easy for a teenager to obtain a handgun in their neighborhood. A third report that they know of someone at their school who has been threatened with a gun or shot at.'' 
   The Hamilton College researchers were the first to nationally survey high school students about their feelings toward gun issues. I am not surprised that the results show overwhelming support for the gun safety proposals that many of us in Congress have been trying to enact into law. Students are well-versed on the dangers of guns in their homes and schools. In this survey, more than twenty-five percent of students reported that they or someone close to them has been ``shot by a gun.'' 
   Mr. President, with just a few weeks remaining until the Senate's target adjournment date, it's long past time to act. Let's listen to our young people and enact the sensible gun laws they want and need to keep American schools safer from gun violence.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Smith amendment would require the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China to monitor the actions of the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners. I believe the allegations that Chinese officials harvest organs from executed prisoners are extremely serious. However, the Congressional Executive Commission already has jurisdiction to look at this practice because it is a human rights violation and the Commission has jurisdiction to monitor and report on human rights violations in the PRC. This very serious allegation should not be singled out among all the human rights abuses of the Chinese government when it is already covered as part of what the Commission can monitor and report on.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my shock at the recent statement of independent counsel Robert Ray in last week's New York Times that he will shortly be releasing findings and conclusions in the Whitewater matter. Only the special court has the authority to release the final report of an independent counsel or any portion of a final report, and the only authority the law gives an independent counsel is to prepare a final report and file it with the special court. Mr. Ray has no legal authority to unilaterally release results of his investigation, and if he does so, he is defying the law. 
   Section 594 of the independent counsel law lists the authority and duties of an independent counsel. And, although this law has expired with respect to the appointment of new independent counsels, it is still the applicable law with respect to already existing independent counsels like Mr. Ray. And here's what the law says with respect to reports by independent counsels.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in each of fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999 the Congress was able to provide $500,000 for this project--funds which were spent to begin construction of models for six priority tributaries. Models of the Nemadji River, and Saginaw River have been completed, but lack of funding in fiscal 2000 has delayed completion of models of the Maumee River, Menominee River, Buffalo River, and Grand Calumet River. Plans to begin development of additional models for priority tributaries in Mill & Cascade Creeks, PA and Grand River, MI have also been delayed. With the first models just finishing completion, we are already seeing the benefits of the program. In the case of the Nemadji River model, the county government is starting to use the model to explore potential effects of changes to forestry practices in the Nemadji River watershed to reduce bank erosion and soil loss to Lake Superior. Preliminary analysis carried out on the Maumee model indicate that soil conservation can reduce future dredging and disposal costs. 
   We note that the House Committee has provided $500,000 in fiscal 2001 funding for the modeling program and ask the distinguished ranking member to make funding for this program a high priority in conference with the House.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year 2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations, we would like to bring to the attention of the distinguished chairman and ranking member the critical problem which the Great Lakes region faces in dealing with a legacy of sediment contamination. 
   In 1987, the International Joint Commission designated 43 Areas of Concern on the Great Lakes where human use of the aquatic resources is severely impaired. Of the 31 U.S. sites, none have been cleaned up to the point of de-listing in the 13 years which have passed since listing. In most cases, the remaining recalcitrant problem is sediments which are contaminated with persistent toxic substances.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, all over America, young people are back in schools. A record 53 million students are in our classrooms and teachers across the country are gearing up to prepare them for the new millennium. In many ways, teachers are doing what they always have at the start of a new school year--they are learning names, starting curriculums, passing out text books and coaching athletic teams. There is nothing highly unusual about recent new school years except that teachers are more concerned for their safety than they were in the past. 
   Over the last few years, the number of high profile school shootings--in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Littleton, Colorado, and Mt. Morris Township, Michigan--have changed Americans' perception of safety in school. On the last day of school in Lake Worth, Florida, a 13 year old boy allegedly shot and killed his language arts teacher with a .25-caliber handgun he brought to school. 
   Teachers in this country fear what may happen to them in the classroom and for good reason. Listen to this middle school teacher in Michigan, who participated in a study conducted by Dr. Ron Astor, an assistant professor of  social work and education at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The teacher said: 
   ``A lot of us are afraid. You come in the morning and you're just afraid to even go to work. You're just so stressed out, because you're all tensed up, you can't feel happy and teach like you want to because you've got to spend all of your time trying to discipline. You're scared somebody's going to walk in. We keep our doors locked. We have to keep our doors locked.'' Middle school teacher. (Meyer, Astor & Behre, 2000). 
   Teachers, students, and staff are fearful of the presence of firearms in school and those of us who feel strongly about education and school safety feel we must do something to ease their fears. During the last few years, we have continually tried to close the loopholes in our laws that give young people access to firearms. In May of 1999, the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill with common sense amendments that would have strengthened our gun laws. After the House passed its version of the bill, the legislation went to a conference committee where Senators and Representatives were supposed to work out the differences between their two versions of the bill. Unfortunately, that conference committee has met only once and that was more than a year ago. 
   In the United States, another ten young people are killed by firearms each day. Congress must pass sensible gun laws and help keep our schools safe.

The Eurasian milfoil is a non-indigenous water plant that floats on the water's surface and forms large mats of plants, which lower the oxygen levels in the water below them, killing fish and making passage by boat very difficult. A large amount of the lake's surface has been infested by the milfoil.

   I thank the Committee for including an $100,000 appropriation for the Clinton River Spillway for an evaluation to determine whether the Clinton River Spillway in Michigan has a design deficiency requiring remediation. 
   During the 1950's, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed a dam on the Clinton River and a spillway to alleviate flooding. Since the completion of the project, debris has built up at the confluence of the Clinton River and spillway. 
   I agree with the Committee that a study must be conducted, however I ask that the study include an analysis of the cause of the debris build up as well as a determination as to whether or not there is a design deficiency. This is a continuing problem in this river basin and the Corps needs to examine the cause of the problem in order to devise a long term solution.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is taking up, as an amendment to the reauthorization of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp, the Semipostal Act, an amendment I sponsored with Senators FEINSTEIN and HUTCHISON. 
   My amendment is very similar to the McHugh bill that we sent to the President yesterday, which establishes the authority to issue semipostals in the U.S. Postal Service. However, it is different in that it requires the Postal Service to recoup the full costs associated with the stamp. This bill will ensure that the Postal Service recovers its costs before funds are made available to the agency to carry out the designated program. We do not want the Postal Service using its own budget to fund contributions to causes designated by semipostals. Only the true net profit from the sale of the semipostals will be made available to  the appropriate agency. This bill also gives the Congress the power to reject a stamp proposal chosen by the Postal Service, if for example, the stamp subject is deemed inappropriate. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that we are giving the authority to issue semipostal stamps to the Postal Service, which is where these decisions belong.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week we received some positive news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. According to newly released statistics, firearm deaths among young people decreased in 1998. 
   The new report shows that firearm deaths among children and adolescents under 20 dropped 10 percent--from 4,223 in 1997 to 3,792 in 1998. Perhaps even more significant, in 1998, deaths among young people were down 35 percent since 1994, when firearms led to the deaths of 5,833 young people. 
   It is no coincidence that firearm casualties have been reduced by 35 percent since 1994, the year the Brady Law went in to effect. The Brady Law, which requires licensed firearms sellers to conduct criminal background checks on prospective gun purchasers, has successfully kept guns out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of criminals and youths. 
   Although we can rejoice that fewer youths are subject to the danger of guns, we should still be dismayed that 10 of our young people (on average) die from guns every day. 10 children and adolescents as well as 74 adult Americans suffered gun-related deaths daily in 1998, and that is far too many. 
   Congress must do more to protect our children and loved ones from these gun tragedies. We can start by strengthening the Brady Law by closing the gun show loophole. That loophole allows perpetrators of violent crimes to buy guns from non-licensed or private sellers, who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This loophole undermines the successes of Brady by arming those who would otherwise not be permitted to purchase firearms. In May of 1999, the Senate passed legislation to close this loophole by extending criminal background checks to guns sold at gun shows and pawn shops, but opponents of this common sense provision have kept it from becoming law. 
   It is disheartening to know that Congress has not yet passed sensible gun laws--laws designed to protect American lives. Without addressing this issue, America will continue to lose 10 young people a day to guns, and that is 10 too many.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for more than 60 years, the Social Security program has been one of the most successful governmental initiatives this country has ever witnessed. August 14, 2000 marks the 65th anniversary of the Social Security Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. This historic event in 1935 changed the face of America by providing protections for retired workers and for those who face loss of income due to disability or death of the family breadwinner. We must look to the future to ensure a strong Social Security program for every individual in America. 
   During the time of the Great Depression, jobs were scarce and many were unable to compete for new employment. President Roosevelt recognized that a change was needed, he called for reform and the Social Security Act was born. 
   Social Security has changed remarkably over the past six decades. Under the 1935 law, Social Security only paid retirement benefits to the primary worker. A 1939 change in the law added survivor benefits and benefits for the retiree's spouse and children. In 1956 disability benefits were added. Thus, we have seen how Social Security has grown to meet the needs of not only retirees, but also their families. 
   For many Americans, Social Security has become a crucial component of their financial well-being. In fact, an estimated 42% of the elderly are kept out of poverty because of their Social Security checks. Today more than 44 million people receive retirement, survivor, and disability benefits through the Social Security program, 1.6 million in Michigan. Social Security has had an enormous effect on the lives of millions of working Americans and their families. 
   As we celebrate this historic event, we remember what America was and how Americans have shaped their country into the prosperous nation that it is today. Since 1935 Social Security has served the American people well and will continue to do so into the future.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill includes a provision to establish a special postage stamp called the semipostal, intended to raise funds for programs to reduce domestic violence. 
   I am a very strong supporter of programs to reduce domestic violence--I believe Congress should fully fund those programs--but I do not agree that another semipostal issue should be mandated by the Congress. 
   Semipostals are stamps that are sold with a surcharge on top of the regular first-class postage rate, with the extra revenue earmarked for a designated cause. Those causes are invariably causes which I think most, if not all, support. They are very appealing causes that come to Congress and ask to require the Postal Service to issue a stamp that has an amount for first-class postage more than the regular 33 cents amount, with the difference going to their cause. 
   The one and only time that we ever did that was for an extraordinarily worthy cause--breast cancer research. The question now is whether we are going to continue down that road and, as a Congress, mandate the Postal Service to issue those stamps for a whole bunch of causes that are competing with each other for us to mandate the Postal Service to issue such a stamp. 
   Section 414 of this bill says:  
   In order to afford the public a convenient way to contribute to funding for domestic violence programs, the Postal Service shall establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail under this section.  
   It then goes on to describe what that rate shall be. It says in part of this section that:  
   It is the sense of the Congress that nothing in this section should directly or indirectly cause a net decrease in total funds received by the Department of Justice or any other agency of the Government, or any component or program thereof below the level that would otherwise have been received but for the enactment of this section.  
   I am not sure how this can possibly be enforced. But that is just one of the problems, not the basic problem, with this language. 
   As I indicated, the first and only example in American history of a semipostal stamp being issued was the breast cancer research stamp which required the Postal Service to turn over extra revenue, less administrative costs, to the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense for its breast cancer research programs. That stamp broke tradition in Congress, not just because it was the first semipostal in our Nation's history but also because it was the first time that Congress mandated the issuance of any stamp in 40 years. I think our tradition of keeping Congress out of the stamp selection process has worked with respect to commemorative stamps, and I believe we should follow that with respect to semipostals as well. 
   For the last 40 years, Congress has deferred to the Postal Service and to an advisory board which it has set up, nonpartisan, out of politics, objective. That Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee recommends subjects for the commemorative stamp program. That committee, the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, was created more than four decades ago to take politics out of the stamp selection process. Committee members review thousands of stamp subjects each year and select only a small number that they believe will be educational and interesting to the public and meet the goals of the Postal Service. 
   Although Congress advises that advisory committee on stamp subjects by making recommendations through letters that we send or through sense-of-Congress resolutions, until now, for the last 40 years, Congress has left the decisionmaking on stamp issuance up to the Postal Service. 
   This is what the Postal Service says about the role of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee:

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are problems with each of the major tax bills. I may spend a moment on each of those problems. On the estate tax bill, it has problems. There is an alternative which is a better alternative, which would help more people. For those relatively few people who do pay an estate tax, the alternative Democratic plan would provide immediate relief--100 percent relief to people who have less than $8 million per couple for family farms and small businesses; total and immediate relief for those people in the alternative plan. 
   The bill which has been adopted has a major problem in that it favors upper income individuals, the wealthiest among us, and most of its benefits go to those people rather than the people who need this the most, which are individuals and married couples who have estates that might be, in the case of a family farm or small business, $8 million or less. But there is a bigger problem, whether we are talking about repeal of the estate tax or the marriage penalty tax. And there--regarding the marriage penalty, we have an alternative as well which would benefit a larger number of low and moderate income people with a greater benefit instead of a group of people who are at the upper end of the income level. The major problem I have with these tax bills is that when you put them all together, what it means is that we would not be able to apply this surplus to reduction of the national debt. 
   I am out there, as all of us are, in our home States. I talk to people and ask people in all the meetings I have: What do you primarily want us to spend the surplus on? Do you want tax cuts--putting aside for the moment whether they benefit upper income folks or benefit working families, put aside that issue for the moment; that is a major issue--do you basically want us to take this $1.8 trillion and pay down the national debt? Or do you want that to go in tax cuts? 
   Overwhelmingly, repeatedly, I hear back from people, they want us to pay down the national debt. Whether we are talking about younger people, middle-age people, older people, they all come to the same conclusion: No. 1, we can't be sure the surplus will be that large so don't spend it all on anything, be it tax cuts or other programs. Spend most of it on protecting the future economy of the United States. Spend most of it on that $6 trillion debt that has been rung up--to reduce the amount of that debt, to try to assure that the economy, which we now have humming, will stay humming; that an economy which we finally have at a  point where we don't add to the national debt with annual deficits each year, that is healthy in terms of interest rates and job creation and in low inflation, that that economy will be there for us next year, next decade, next generation. 
   I believe that is what the American people overwhelmingly want us to do. We can argue, and we should, and we can debate, and we should, which estate tax proposal is a better estate tax proposal. That is a legitimate debate. We obviously have an alternative to the one that was adopted which is targeted to the people who need it the most, people who have farms and small businesses and estates worth up to $8 million, people who are still paying an estate tax even though it might mean in some cases that they could lose that family farm. Our alternative provides total relief to those families and immediate relief to those families, unlike the one that was passed by the Republican majority which gives most of its cuts to the people who need it the least, people who are in the higher brackets, higher asset levels, and phases it in and then only does it partially. 
   We should, and we do, debate those issues: Which alternative plans on the estate tax or on the marriage penalty tax provide the fairest kind of tax relief to the people who need it the most. But the underlying issue, which is one I hope we will keep in mind, is whether or not we want to commit this projected surplus of almost $2 trillion in 10 years to any of these proposals to the extent that we have. 
   Be it tax cuts or be it efforts to improve education or health care or what have you, it is my hope and belief that the greatest contribution we can make to our children and to their children is to protect this economy, to try to keep an economy, which is now doing so well, healthy in future years, as it has been in the past few years. That means we need to protect that surplus, not spend it; not use it for tax cuts on the assumption that there is going to be $1.8 trillion or $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, because there is too much uncertainty in that, because our people sense--and correctly--that we do not know for certain that that budget surplus will in fact be there. 
   There has been recent public opinion polling which seems to me illuminating on this subject. When people are asked whether or not they want to protect Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt, or whether or not they think passing a tax cut is the better way to go, 75 percent believe protecting Social Security and paying down the debt is the most important priority we have right now. Only 23 percent favor passing tax cuts as an alternative. When asked the question of whether or not the trillion-dollar tax cut package that was passed last year, without a penny for Medicare, and whether or not the tax cuts that are being added this year to the same amount, still without a penny for Medicare, is the better way to go, 63 percent say no, 32 percent say yes. 
   So the public senses that with the surplus we have, the proportion we project, the best thing we can do to protect our economy and the best thing we can do with that projected surplus is in fact to pay down the debt, protect Medicare, and to target our efforts on some of the needs we have as a country, rather than to provide for the kind of tax cuts that we have seen the Republicans enact. 
   What I have said about the estate tax is also true relative to the marriage penalty bill. We have two alternatives--the one that passed, but we also have an alternative that did not pass, which provides targeted, comprehensive relief and is fiscally more responsible because it leaves more for debt reduction and, therefore, overall is a better value for the American taxpayer. The alternative completely eliminates the penalty in all of its forms, not just in a few, as the marriage tax penalty legislation we passed does. The Democratic alternative eliminates it for couples earning up to $100,000, which is 80 percent of all married couples, and it costs $29 billion per year when fully phased in. 
   The plan that was adopted, the Republican plan, confers 40 percent of its benefits on taxpayers who currently suffer a penalty. In other words, only 40 percent of the benefits of the Republican plan go to taxpayers who currently actually suffer a penalty. The rest of the people who get a benefit in the Republican plan either don't suffer a penalty--indeed they received a bonus when they got married--or are left untouched one way or another. And the Republican plan addresses only 3 of the 65 instances of the penalty in the Tax Code, whereas the Democratic alternative plan addresses every place in the Tax Code where the marriage penalty exists. And the Republican plan costs $40 billion when fully phased in as compared to $29 billion per year for the alternative Democratic plan. 
   So, again, it seems to me it is a pretty clear choice that we have: Do we want a plan that is targeted to people who earn under $100,000, that confers benefits on people who are truly penalized when they are married, in terms of the taxes they pay, and a plan that does so at a cost significantly less than in the Republican plan that was adopted? Or do we want to adopt the more costly plan, most of the benefits of which go to people who are in the upper income brackets, and then do not address totally the problem that exists for those people who do suffer a tax penalty upon marriage? 
   The same thing is true with the overall tax cut that has been proposed. We have basically two alternatives that have been set 
   forth to the American people, not yet put in the legislative form, but which have been proposed by Governor Bush and Vice President GORE. According to the Citizens For Tax Justice, the distribution of benefits of the Bush plan basically provides that 10 percent of the taxpayers get 60 percent--the upper 10 percent, the top 10 percent of taxpayers, get 60 percent of the benefits; the bottom 60 percent of the taxpayers get 12 percent of the benefits. That is the tax plan that has been proposed by Governor Bush. 
   It would reduce revenues by $460 billion over the first 5 fiscal years, and by $1.3 trillion over 9 fiscal years, plus an additional $265 billion in associated interest costs. That is an extraordinarily expensive plan. We haven't seen that yet in legislative form, and I am not sure we will. Nonetheless, the American people are again going to be presented with very different approaches as to how we should use the surplus. 
   Some people say, ``Senator, that is our money you are talking about; what is wrong with the tax cut?'' My answer is that it is our money, your money. It is also our economy. It is also our Social Security program. It is also our Medicare program. It is also our education program. It is our health care program. 
   So the argument that this money belongs to the people of the United States is clearly true. I think it is undeniable. I can't imagine anybody suggesting that anything in the Treasury is anything but the property of the people of the United States. But the other half of that, which is too often left out, is that the economy, which is now healthy, belongs to the people of the United States. They have made it possible, through their work, for us to have a strong economy. Keeping that economy healthy is also the job of this Congress, as well as the job of the people of the United States. 
   The Social Security system, which has made such a difference for so many that the poverty rate among seniors is now 5 percent, compared to the poverty rate among children, which is 20 percent, mainly because of the existence of Social Security--that program belongs to the people of the United States. Protecting that program is also our responsibility. So to say that, yes, the surplus belongs to the people is true. But the Medicare program, Social Security program, health care program, education program also belong to the people of the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to a remarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Senator Jackie Vaughn III. On July 30, Senator Vaughn, the Associate President Pro Tempore for the Michigan State Senate, will be honored for his tireless public service to Detroit and the entire state of Michigan. 
   Senator Vaughn's history of public service is truly deserving of recognition. For the past twenty-two years this ``Man of Peace'' has represented the Fourth Senatorial District of Michigan with a sense of justice and concern for all members of society. He has drafted wide-ranging legislation that has, among other things, sought to expand voting rights, promote peace and provide educational opportunities for all citizens. 
   Such a diverse array of interests and concerns should come as no surprise to those who know Jackie. Senator Vaughn is a renaissance man who has been educated at many of the world's finest institutions of higher learning. The recipient of a Fullbright Scholarship, Senator Vaughn has received the Oxon B. Litt from England's Oxford University, a Master's Degree from Oberlin College and a B.A. from Hillsdale College. In addition, has been awarded honorary doctorates from Highland Park College, Marygrove College, Shaw College and the Urban Bible Institute. 
   Senator Vaughn has sought to pass his love of learning on to subsequent generations through his teaching at the University of Detroit, Wayne State University and Hartford Memorial Church where he has led the Contemporary Issues Sunday School Class for twenty years. 
   Senator Vaughn can take pride in his long and honorable service in the Michigan State Senate. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Senator Jackie Vaughn for his commitment to Detroit, the State of Michigan and the entire Nation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 which included an amendment I sponsored to outlaw the resale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition, including .50 caliber ammunition, to civilians. 
   This amendment requires the Department of Defense to ensure that military surplus armor-piercing ammunition is not sold or transferred to anyone except foreign militaries or law enforcement or other government agencies. Armor piercing ammunition is extremely lethal and is powerful enough to pierce an armored limousine or helicopter. It has no legitimate civilian use. 
   Last year, Congress approved legislation which instituted a one-year restriction on the civilian sale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition; the amendment approved by the Senate last week would put that temporary restriction into permanent law. Before the one-year restriction was enacted, under the Conventional Demilitarization Program, a contractor working with the Department of Defense was paid $1 per ton to take possession of its excess armor-piercing ammunition, which it was free to refurbish and resell to the general public. 
   The Department of Defense should not be a party to making this extraordinarily destructive ammunition available to the general public. Once available on the market, this powerful ammunition is subject to virtually no restriction, making it easier for someone to purchase armor piercing ammunition capable of piercing an armored car, than it is to buy a handgun. These loose restrictions make armor piercing ammunition highly popular among terrorists, drug traffickers and violent criminals. 
   An investigation by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that armor piercing .50 caliber ammunition is ``among the most destructive and powerful ammunition available in the United States'' and the ``widespread availability'' of the bullets ``poses a threat to public safety.'' In the year ending in March, 1999, more than 113,000 rounds of military surplus armor piercing .50 caliber ammunition were sold in the United States. 
   The amendment to prohibit the resale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition is a small but important step in keeping our streets safe.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which would assist apple growers who suffered losses from fire blight and other weather related and economic damage. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators COLLINS, SCHUMER, GORTON, MURRAY, SNOWE, LEAHY, JEFFORDS, MOYNIHAN, DURBIN, ROCKEFELLER, ROBB, ABRAHAM, and LIEBERMAN. This spring, apple growers in Michigan suffered huge crop losses and damage due to several hail storms which caused thousands of acres of apple trees to be infected with fire blight. Fire blight is a bacterium that has destroyed thousands of acres of fruit trees in Michigan. Experts at Michigan State University anticipate that 1/4 of all MI apple farmers have trees that are afflicted by fire blight. As a result of this weather related disaster, many of Michigan's best apple producers face diminished production this fall, and decreased revenues for many years to come. My amendment provides essential assistance for apple and potato producers that have suffered quantity losses due to fire blight or other weather related disasters. These hardships could not come at a worse time for our nation's apple farmers who, according to USDA, have lost nearly $1 billion over the past three years due to a variety of factors including diseases, such as fire blight. This legislation also includes assistance for apple and potato farmers who have incurred quality losses due to weather-related disasters.

I want to thank Senators COCHRAN and KOHL for staying with this issue for those of us who represent States with true disasters, true emergencies, that were not represented in the bill as it came to the Senate.

Our Governor has requested that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman grant a disaster designation for seven counties in Michigan that have been afflicted by fire blight.

   Mr. LEVIN. We are always the No. 2 or No. 3 state in terms of apple production. Every year we vie with New York for who comes in second after the State of Washington. But our apple industry has suffered major devastation in southwestern Michigan. We have had the largest problem with fire blight in the history of our State. It is a true disaster. It seems to me some people just look at the whole and ignore the parts. They also have a responsibility of looking at the parts. Our part was a disaster which we addressed in the form of an amendment providing relief on June 19. Senator COLLINS and 12 bipartisan cosponsors joined this amendment. I thank them very much for their assistance. We cover potatoes as well as apples because there has been an honest to goodness disaster emergency amongst potato growers as well. 
   I once again, thank the managers of this bill. I know how difficult this is. Those of us who represent States that had emergencies that were not reflected in the bill, as it came to the Senate, counted on the managers and our colleagues to do justice for our emergencies in the same way this bill, as it came to the Senate, addressed emergencies in other States. 
   We are deeply grateful to the managers. We thank Senator STEVENS and others who were able to work out this agreement so our true disaster could be taken care of.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate S. 2536, the Fiscal Year 2001 Appropriations Act for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. I am concerned that this bill omits an appropriation included in the House version of this bill (H.R. 4461). 
   H.R. 4461 appropriates $309,600 for the Agriculture Research Service (ARS) to fund research addressing Postharvest Handling and Mechanization to Minimize Damage for Fruits. This research is vital, not only for Michigan, but for all fruit producing states. 
   This research has the potential to allow fruit growers to realize greater profits by better ensuring fruit quality. Given the significant potential of this program to assist fruit producers in my home state, I am troubled by its exclusion in S. 2536.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. One agricultural emergency that currently affects my home state of Michigan, and which threatens livestock in the Upper Midwest is bovine tuberculosis (TB). Due to a host of factors, Michigan is the only state in the Union where bovine TB has actually been transferred from livestock into the wild. Most frequently, this disease has been transferred from cattle to members of the Cervid family, such as whitetail deer. Deer then are able to transfer TB to herds of cattle, wild animals or humans. As a result of this disease, neighboring states have restricted the entry of Michigan cattle, farmers have been required to test their cattle for this disease and some livestock producers have had to eradicate their herds. I would ask the Senator from Wisconsin, if he believes that the matter of bovine TB constitutes an emergency.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator JEFFORDS and Senator DORGAN for this amendment. There is no reason why American consumers should not have access to lower-priced medicines, while assuring the safety of those medicines that are imported. 
   I quote from an editorial from the Detroit News. This is an editorial department which is very outspokenly conservative, avowedly conservative in its editorial policy. It says:  
   ......Congress should remove the prohibition because the federal government ought not to restrict the purchasing options of Americans.  
   It goes on to say:  
   ......using government coercion to prevent Americans from purchasing drugs from abroad is not the way to go.  
   That is what this issue is all about. This is whether or not we are going to use the free market. This has nothing to do with setting prices. This has to do with using a free market to allow the reimportation of something manufactured in the United States after it has been certified by the FDA that it is safe to do so. 
   It is incredibly galling as well as incredibly expensive for my constituents in Michigan to go across the border to Canada in order to buy drugs at about half the price of what they are charged for those same drugs in Michigan. Again, these are drugs manufactured in the United States and exported to Canada. All this amendment says is that it ought to be possible for our wholesalers and our pharmacists to import something back into the United States manufactured in the United States and having been approved by a process of the FDA to make sure that it is safe. 
   We have done a survey in my home State. We have compared the prices of these drugs. They are quite extraordinary. We have many people who cannot afford these drugs. These are often lifesaving drugs, life-extending drugs. These are drugs which reduce pain, which make it possible for people to be more mobile than they otherwise would be. 
   We looked at seven of these most popular drugs because there were three on which we could not make a comparison because they were over-the-counter drugs in Canada or otherwise unavailable to get prices, but seven of the most popular drugs. Premarin is an estrogen tablet taken by menopausal women. It costs $23 in Michigan, $10 in Ontario. Synthroid--this replaces a hormone which is normally produced by the thyroid gland--costs over $13 in Michigan, under $8 in Ontario. We could go through the next five drugs on this list, and I have done this already in the RECORD in previous remarks I made on the Senate floor. 
   We cannot afford to be subsidizing the consumers in other countries. We ought to use the free market that we are all so proud of to allow the import of something which is, by the way,  manufactured in the United States and, by the way, in some cases had previously received financial support from the taxpayers of the United States through either the Tax Code on research and development or, in some cases, direct grants from the National Institutes of Health to the scientists who developed these drugs. 
   It is really an intolerable situation when we have people in our States who can't afford these critically important drugs and are simply prohibited from having a wholesaler or a pharmacist import that drug from another country. Since the amendment provides for safety through a process which has to be approved by the FDA, it seems to me this is a sensible thing to do. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join with all of my colleagues today in praising the life and celebrating the life and grieving the loss of PAUL COVERDELL. He was a friend and someone whom I trusted. I think we all trust each other here because we are family. But I had a special fondness and a special trust for PAUL COVERDELL. He was a man of tremendous integrity, directness, and modesty. 
   There are many instances over our time period together that come to mind. But one in particular is perhaps the most recent one. I had a matter that was of great personal concern to me. It was an issue where he and I differed philosophically but where I needed his help in order to get my position heard. He agreed it should be heard, even though he disagreed with it. I went to him and asked him whether or not he might assist me in that process, and he said, ``CARL, I don't agree with you on this issue, but this is a matter of great import for this country and your views clearly should be considered by the decisionmaker here. I am going to do everything I can to make sure that in fact those views are considered.'' 
   That said a lot about this man and about this place. Although we disagreed on an issue, he believed that the principle of having both sides heard was more important than the specifics of the issue. His integrity was indisputable and undoubted. We came to rely on him in so many ways. His background made him particularly able to make a special contribution to this Senate. He had great skills as a legislative craftsman and tactician. He, of course, had a wonderful background in the Peace Corps, and there were so many other ways he was able to contribute as a very special force in the deliberations on this floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Reverend Nick Hall Jr. On July 23, Rev. Hall will retire after 48 years of service to the Bethesda Baptist Church in Saginaw. 
   Reverend Hall's history of pubic service is truly deserving of recognition. After serving his country in the Navy during World War II, he received his Bachelor of Theology from the Chicago Baptist Institute in 1950. He then moved to Saginaw, Michigan and organized the Bethesda Baptist Church in 1952, where he has ministered there for nearly five decades. In 1990, he furthered his studies in Theology by earning his Doctor of Divinity from Urban Bible College in Detroit. In addition to his career in the ministry, Rev. Hall has dedicated himself to civic leadership through his work with many community organizations. From civil rights activist to County Commissioner, he has won many hats in his long public career, but all of them have shown a true dedication to his community. For the last 48 years, Rev. Hall has served with integrity and compassion. 
   Rev. Hall's departure from Bethesda Baptist Church will certainly mark a new chapter in his life. I can only hope it is as successful as this previous one. Though I am sure he will remain active in his many church and community activities, I hope that he will be able to spend more time with his wife, Marie, and their children and grandchildren. I am pleased to join his family, congregation, and friends in offering my thanks for all he has done. 
   Mr. President, Reverend Nick Hall, Jr. can take pride in his long and honorable career to Bethesda Baptist Church. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Rev. Hall's commitment to his community and religion, and in wishing him well in his retirement.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR) reauthorization  bill (H.R. 2392) that will reauthorize the SBIR program for eight more years. An eight year reauthorization will allow participating agencies to continue to do long term planning for their research and development (R&D) needs. I'm especially pleased that this legislation includes my bill to establish a volunteer mentoring program. 
   The SBIR program, originally established in 1982 and reauthorized and expanded in 1992, expires this year. This highly competitive program has a well-deserved reputation for success and has enjoyed bipartisan support over the years. It improves upon what is already a successful program that gives small high technology companies access to federal research and development dollars and the federal government access to some of the world's best innovation. I am pleased the full Senate is considering this legislation today and I hope House consideration will swiftly follow so that contracting agencies can be assured funding will be available in this contract cycle. 
   I am a long time supporter of the SBIR program. The SBIR program creates jobs, increases our capacity for technological innovation and boosts our international competitiveness. According to a recent GAO study, about 50 percent of all SBIR research is commercialized or receives additional research funding. That's a pretty good success rate. It's also a great example of federal agencies working together with small businesses to develop technologies to solve specific problems and fill government procurement needs in a cost effective way. 
   The SBIR program is a highly successful program and we can make it even more successful by establishing an outreach and volunteer mentoring program to bring more high technology small businesses into the program and help them successfully compete for awards. Many states believe they can do better regarding the number of SBIR awards their small businesses win. Since the SBIR program is a highly competitive and merit-based program, I believe the best way to increase participation is through outreach and mentoring. The SBIR reauthorization bill before the Senate today creates programs to do both. 
   The Federal and States Technology Partnership Program (FAST) included in this bill establishes an outreach program through a technology economic development program that aims to build more support for science and technology research in states. 
   A natural complement to reaching out to new companies to tell them about the SBIR program is the establishment of a ``mentoring network'' to increase their odds for success in that program. Many SBIR company officials have benefitted from this R&D program, are committed to its success and have told me they want to give something back by way of mentoring small companies new to the SBIR program. Many attribute their SBIR contracts with federal agencies as the main reason they have been able to successfully commercialize their research, make a ``real'' product, and expand employment in their companies. Through my proposal, mentoring networks will be established to match volunteer mentors with new applicant high technology small businesses to help increase their chances for success in the SBIR program, and, ultimately, the commercialization of their research. A small business's failure to obtain a phase I or phase II SBIR award may have nothing to do with the capability of its technology but rather is often a result of a lack of understanding the government procurement process and procedures. Mentoring will address this concern by matching the new company with one that already knows the ropes of the SBIR program and federal procurement process. 
   This is a cost effective program. Modeled after the successful SCORE program, the mentoring networks' volunteer mentors would be reimbursed only for their out-of-pocket expenses. Their time, energy and know-how would be donated free-of-charge. Specifically, the bill provides for the establishment of mentoring networks that are eligible for matching grants within the FAST program in each state. The mentoring network (an association, organization, coalition or other entity) will provide business advice and counseling and assist small business concerns that have been identified as good candidates for the SBIR program. Volunteer mentors are people associated with small businesses that have successfully competed one or more SBIR funding agreement and have agreed to guide small business concerns through all stages of the SBIR program process. 
   The mentoring networks program also establishes an important publicly accessible national database housed at SBA to compile information on mentoring networks and volunteer mentors. This database will provide an important tool to increase small business' access to mentors. I urge SBA to devote its full attention to getting it up and running upon enactment of this legislation. 
   H.R. 2392 also expands the collection, reporting and maintenance of information for an SBA database regarding SBIR awards. It fixes a problem identified by GAO by requiring a uniform definition of ``extramural R&D budget,'' the formula used by each participating agency to determine the level of funds dedicated to the SBIR program. It establishes a five year competitive matching grant pilot program administered by the SBA for an organization or consortia to perform outreach and technology economic development within states, including establishing or operating a mentoring network to provide advice and counseling to SBIR applicants. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of this important high technology small business procurement program and the improvements to it that H.R. 2392 provides.

I also want to reiterate my support for a program of great interest to me and my colleagues from the Great Lakes states. 
   The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act authorizes funding for a grants program for the implementation of fish and wildlife restoration projects recommended in the Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study. Enthusiasm for this program has been high and proposals for grants have exceeded available funds. Nevertheless, the Administration has proposed discontinuation of these grants in its budget request. I thank the chairman and ranking member for recognizing the value of Great Lakes fish and wildlife restoration grants and maintaining funding for these grants at this year's $398,000 level. 
   I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member if, should additional funds become available, he would consider increasing the grants funding for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Program by an additional $500,000?

   Mr. LEVIN. I am aware that the bill before us contains funding for Operations of the National Park System in the amount of $1,443,795,000, which is more than $80 million above the Fiscal Year 2000 level. I am also aware that approximately $25.6 million has been provided for increases in the base operating budgets of more than 80 parks and related sites, including increases of $325,000 for Isle Royale National Park and $850,000 for Keweenaw National Historic Park. I greatly appreciate that the chairman and ranking member have been able to provide these amounts. I must say to my colleagues, though, that there is also a significant  need for operating increases at other Michigan parks such as the North Country National Scenic Trail and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from West Virginia whether such additional needs, including those above the President's request, will be considered in conference, or, in the event additional resources are not available, whether he would consider a reallocation of operational funds for Michigan parks?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Fiscal Year 2001 Appropriations Act for the Department of Interior and Related Agencies. 
   I want to express my support for the American Heritage Rivers Initiative. This bill contains a provision that prohibits funds in the Act from being given to or used to provide support for the Executive Office of the President in coordinating the American Heritage Rivers. It also prevents the Council on Environmental Quality from receiving funds and support to coordinate and oversee the initiative. 
   The American Heritage Rivers Initiative, which redirects federal resources without new spending, has greatly improved the Detroit River, a designated American Heritage River, through shoreline development and protection of wetlands. In the ten months that the River Navigator for the Greater Detroit American Heritage River has been in operation, over $1 million has been acquired for Detroit River projects. This program also assists communities in the use of Federal resources to help communities revitalize parks--to help celebrate their history and their heritage. 
   This initiative needs our support and full participation and I strongly oppose any language which would put this program in jeopardy.

I voted for the Democratic plan and had it passed would not have supported the Hollings amendment. However, since the Democratic alternative to the pending bill was defeated yesterday by a 46-50 vote, and since the Republican bill would cost a wasteful $40 billion a year, reflecting the wrong priorities, I will support the Hollings amendment to better use those funds to pay down the national debt.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican marriage penalty tax reform proposal and support the Democratic alternative for three simple reasons: the Democratic alternative is targeted, provides comprehensive relief, and is fiscally responsible, and the Republican plan is not. 
   First, the Democratic relief plan is targeted: It confers 100% of its benefits on couples suffering a marriage penalty--when two individuals pay more in income taxes as a married couple, filing jointly than they would if they remained single. The Republican plan confers only 40 percent of its benefits to taxpayers who currently suffer a penalty. Of the remaining benefits, 37 percent go to couples currently receiving a marriage bonus--when two individuals pay less in income taxes as a married couple, filing jointly than they would if they remained single. So the Republican plan is effectively a singles penalty bill. 
   Second, the Democratic relief plan is comprehensive: There are 65 areas of the tax code where a marriage penalty occurs--from the standard deduction to the earned income tax credit. The Democratic plan addresses all of them. In fact it completely eliminates the penalty--in all its forms--for couples earning up to $100,000, 80% of all married couples. The Republican plan addresses only 3 of the 65 places in the tax code where the marriage penalty occurs--it doesn't address the other 62. So the Republican plan provides inadequate, incomplete relief. 
   Despite these deficiencies, or perhaps, because of them, the Republican plan carries an enormous, fiscally irresponsible price tag of $40 billion per  year when fully in place--compared with $29 billion per year for the Democratic alternative. Allocating so much money to an inefficient, poorly targeted tax cut leaves no room for other important national priorities and threatens the very prosperity that has made tax cuts possible. The Democratic proposal is simply a better value for the American taxpayer.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican proposal to repeal the Federal estate tax and support the Democratic alternative proposal to provide relief from the estate tax to those who need it most--small businesses and family farms. 
   The current estate tax was first enacted by Congress in 1916, partly at the behest of President Theodore Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt was right. It's appropriate to tax a little more those who have prospered greatly from the American political and economic systems in order to provide some assistance to those who have also worked hard but have fallen behind. That's the basic tenet of our progressive system of taxation. Roosevelt was also correct that the tax should not discourage people from seeing to it that their children are well-off, but rather be aimed at immense fortunes. That is why I support the Democratic proposal to reform the estate tax to provide prompt relief to small business owners and farmers, rather than the Republican proposal to repeal it gradually over the next ten years, but totally for even the greatest fortunes while making small businesses and farmers wait for relief. 
   The Democratic proposal targets tax relief to persons with more modest estates and to small businesses and family farms and it does so at a more reasonable cost. By increasing the exemption for Qualified Family-Owned Business Interests from its current level of $2.6 million per couple to $4 million per couple in 2001, the Democratic alternative provides immediate relief by removing altogether more than 90 percent of family farms and more than 60 percent of small businesses from the estate tax rolls. In stark contrast, the Republican plan removes no one from the estate tax burden for another 10 years.  
   In addition to providing relief immediately, the Democratic proposal does so at a more reasonable cost--$64 billion over 10 years, compared to $105 billion for the Republican repeal. This $40 billion difference can and should go to other important national priorities--such as a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, making a college education more affordable, extending Medicare's solvency, or reducing the national debt. But the Republican repeal will cost much more than that. In its second 10 years, 2011-2020, the same decade in which the baby boomers begin to retire and place enormous strains on the Medicare system and on Social Security, the Republican repeal is estimated to cost up to $750 billion. To give such a huge tax cut to a few thousand of the wealthiest among us at the expense of important national priorities for our children, grandchildren, and senior citizens is simply wrong. 
   I believe that taxes should be distributed fairly among all Americans. I also believe that we have a responsibility to protect Medicare and Social Security, to pay down the national debt, and to make the investments in health-care, education and other key areas that will keep America strong in the future. The Democratic estate tax reform plan is consistent with these goals. The Republican plan puts them at risk.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments this afternoon to explain why I opposed the Republican proposal to repeal the Federal estate tax and why I supported the alternative Democratic proposal to provide relief in the estate tax for those who, in any judgment, need it the most, that is, small businesses, family farms, and those who are more modestly situated than those who would receive the most of the relief under the Republican proposal. 
   The current estate tax was first enacted by Congress in 1916, partly at the behest of President Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt was right; it is appropriate for there to be an estate tax on those who prosper so greatly in the American economic system in order to provide some assistance to those who have worked hard but have fallen behind and in order also to do some things we must do in order to improve our society and our communities. That is the basic tenet of a progressive system of taxation. 
   I think President Teddy Roosevelt was also correct that the tax should not be designed in such a way as to discourage people from seeing to it that their children are more secure but, rather, it should be aimed at immense fortunes which have been created. 
   That is why I supported the Democratic proposal to reform the estate tax to provide prompt relief to small business owners and farmers rather than voting for the Republican proposal which 
   would have repealed it more slowly over the next 10 years but then would have totally repealed it for even the greatest portion. 
   The Democratic proposal targets tax relief to persons with estates, small businesses, and family farms of up to $8 million. By increasing the exemption for qualified family-owned business interests from its current level of $2.6 million per couple to $4 million per couple in 2001 and $8 million per couple in 2009, the Democratic alternative provides significant immediate relief and then removes altogether the tax for the vast majority of the 2 percent of family farms and small businesses that are currently subject to the tax. 
   In contrast, the Republican plan removes no one from the estate tax burden totally for another 10 years but then removes even the largest estate completely at huge costs to the Treasury. 
   In addition to providing relief immediately, the Democratic proposal does so at a more reasonable cost--$64 billion over 10 years--compared to $105 billion for the Republican repeal. This $40 billion difference can and should go to other important national priorities, such as a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, making a college education more affordable, extending Medicare solvency, or reducing the national debt. 
   The Republican repeal would cost much more than that because in the second 10 years--from 2011 to 2020, the same decade in which the baby boomers begin to retire and place strains on the Medicare system and on Social Security--the repeal is estimated to cost up to $750 billion. 
   That is what these two charts show. There is a significant revenue loss from the Republican repeal, starting in 2010 at the rate of about $23 billion a year, going up to $53 billion a year in 2015, and then $66 billion a year in 2020, $82 billion in 2025, and so forth. 
   That kind of severe strain on the Treasury begins in about the year 2010--that is, at the same time when there is a great demand on the Treasury to make payments to Social Security. Until about 2012, Social Security is in surplus. But then in about 2012, Social Security takes in less than it is paying out, and the Treasury from the general fund must begin to pay back to Social Security a part of the debt which has been built up for Social Security. Those payments significantly increase, starting in the near 2015 from $12 billion a year, to $183 billion in 2020, to $416 billion a year in 2025, and so forth. 
   That is one of the major problems with the estate tax proposal the Republican majority offered--that the drain it is going to place on the Treasury, the loss to the Treasury, begins to hit severely at precisely the same time, or at least approximately the same time, as there is a significant shortfall for Social Security and when payments must be paid from the Treasury to Social Security if we are going to keep our promise to those who retire in those years. 
   I believe taxes should be distributed fairly among all Americans. To give a huge tax cut to the wealthiest among us at the expense of important national priorities for the rest of us, at the risk of not being able to pay what is required to Social Security recipients, what is committed to be paid to them, and what was promised to be paid to the recipients of Social Security starting in the years 2012 and beyond, is a serious mistake. It is simply wrong. 
   I believe the Democratic estate tax reform plan is consistent with national priorities and is consistent with keeping our commitments to Social Security. The alternative Republican plan puts those commitments at risk and puts those priorities at risk. That is why I thought the Democratic plan was fairer to our taxpayers and fairer to this Nation. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the life of one of Michigan's great civic leaders, William J. Beckham, Jr. After living a remarkably accomplished life, sadly, Bill passed away April 27th while on vacation with his beloved wife, Mattie Maynard Beckham. This week, Bill's friends and colleagues and members of the Senate and the House will come together in our Nation's capital to celebrate his memory and his legacy. 
   Bill loved life and all the important things in it--his family, his friends, school kids, and his African American heritage. Bill loved the difference that he was making in Michigan through his work on school reform--enhancing and expanding the quality of education for all students in the Detroit public school system. Behind Bill's dignified, gentle yet deliberate manner was a fierce determination to help improve the everyday lives of families. Multitudes were beneficiaries of his visionary efforts. He showed that character and the principles of hard work, integrity and perseverance can transform one's dreams into reality. He has left a mark of great achievement in civil rights, education, economic and political reform. 
   Bill had a distinguished career of public service in Michigan, which included positions as Vice Chair of the School Board for the Detroit Public Schools, Chairman of the Schools of the 21st Century Corporation, President and Trustee of The Skillman Foundation, the first Deputy Mayor of Detroit, and President of New Detroit, Inc. His successful career in the private sector included key leadership positions at Burroughs/Unisys Corporation, Envirotest Systems Corporation in Phoenix and the Ford Motor Company. 
   Bill also enjoyed a long and noteworthy career in federal service from 1967 through the early 1980s. Over a period of eight years, he served Senator Phil Hart in several capacities including Policy Adviser in his Washington office for 4 years, Chief of Staff of the Senator's office in Detroit for three years, and Campaign Assistant for one year. Bill subsequently served as Staff Director to the House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Equal Opportunity, chaired by Representative Gus Hawkins. Sought out by President Jimmy Carter, Bill was nominated and confirmed first as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and later as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   During his tenure on Capitol Hill, Bill joined with several of his staff colleagues to establish the first minority congressional staff group to study and act on the political and legislative demands of minority communities nationwide. The group's pioneering efforts in Quitman and Cohoma Counties in Mississippi, along with civil rights leader John Lewis and, my brother, Sander Levin (both of whom now serve in the House) helped to mark a new and powerful political and participatory direction for the people of the Mississippi Delta. Wise and loyal colleagues--Gordon Alexander, Jackie Parker, Judy Jackson, Willa Rawls Dumas, Alan Boyd, Dora Jean Malachi, Mattie Barrow and Bob Parker--declared Bill their leader. The group moved ahead and soon designed the legendary mission to the Mississippi Delta; and, under the direction of Julian Bond of the then-Southern Elections Fund, pursued other worthy political initiatives.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise as an original co-sponsor of the Domenici Nuclear Cities amendment and to note that this important amendment was unanimously agreed to by the Senate. 
   The Russia nuclear weapons complex is a vast collection of highly secret closed cities. This complex is far larger and has significantly more capability to produce nuclear weapons than the US nuclear weapons complex. Just over two years ago, the Department of Energy was presented with a unique opportunity to help Russia significantly reduce this complex, including the opportunity to close 2 of the three Russian nuclear weapons assembly facilities. 
   The DOE through its nuclear cities initiative has been working closely with its Russian counterpart, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, known as MinAtom, to reduce the size of the Russian nuclear complex by 50 percent. DOE started this effort just over two years ago, and while it took a while to get off the ground, the Nuclear Cities Program has begun to demonstrate real progress. 
   This amendment would direct the Secretary of Energy to expand and accelerate the activities under the Nuclear Cities Program and further assist Russia in downsizing its nuclear weapons complex. To help with this effort the amendment will provide an additional $12.5 million over the current $17 million authorized in the bill. Compared to the overall defense budget this is a small amount but an amount that can help reduce the Russian nuclear weapons complex. 
   This amendment directs the U.S. DOE and MinAtom, to enter into an agreement to establish a plan, with milestones, to consolidate the Russian nuclear weapons complex. In addition, MinAtom must agree, in writing, to close some of its nuclear weapons facilities, before the additional $12.5 million can be spent. 
   We have a unique opportunity to further U.S. national security interests by closing some of the Russian nuclear weapons facilities. While the full burden to downsize the Russian complex remains a Russian obligation we can and should help. It is important to improve and further our relationship with Russian at all levels. The Nuclear Cities program provides many benefits to the U.S. and to Russia. The U.S. should grab this opportunity. In the future, Mr. President, I would like to see the program expanded further; this amendment is a good first step.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank our chairman for his extraordinary leadership. Since Congress, in 1959, said that we were required to pass an annual authorization bill for the Defense Department, we have never failed. We have succeeded again this year, despite some real odds. We passed a record number of amendments. We did it because of the work of all the members of the Armed Services Committee, our staffs, and our leadership on both sides. 
   If I can just single out one person, I want to single out, in the leadership, if  I may, Senator REID, for just sort of being here constantly to help us move the process forward. 
   Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, all the leadership, our subcommittee chairmen, ranking members, our staffs really deserve credit for this. It is an extraordinary accomplishment, and it is a real feather in our chairman's cap.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two new studies just released show that states with a high concentration of gun industry activity and weak gun laws tend to be the major suppliers of crime guns in other states. 
   On June 28, 2000, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) released Gunland USA, a study which ranks states by their level of gun industry activity. For each state VPC reported the number of gun shows, licensed firearms retailers (including pawnshops), manufacturers producing firearms, and licensed machine gun dealers as well as the number of registered machine guns. In each of these categories, Texas ranks number one. Other states that showed a very high level of gun industry presence were California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia and Ohio. 
   People in my state of Michigan may wonder how activity in other states like Illinois or Georgia affects them at home. A study released by Senator SCHUMER entitled War Between the States explains that many of the crime guns used in Michigan come from out of state. Interstate gunrunners acquire guns in states with weak laws and flood the markets in specific states and regions that have stricter gun laws. According to this report, states such as Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, and Ohio--the same states with high levels of gun industry activity--are the major suppliers of guns used to commit crimes in other states with tougher gun laws. The study cites Michigan as a state ``with strict gun laws'' and as one with 41% of guns traced to crime coming from other states such as Ohio and Georgia. 
   These findings demonstrate the need to tighten our national gun laws. Without national standards, states with a  high level of gun industry presence and weak gun laws will continue to serve as major suppliers for gunrunners who traffic guns to states with tougher gun laws--states like Michigan. We must close the loopholes in our national framework for firearms distribution by among other things closing the gun show loophole.

   Mr. LEVIN. I say to my good friend from Massachusetts, I happen to agree with his thoughts on this subject. We are very close in terms of our views. However, there is a complete misunderstanding about the year 2005. That is not the year when the intelligence estimates say North Korea will be able to pose a threat to us.

   Mr. LEVIN. They can do it today. But 2005 is the year which the Secretary of Defense thought at the time he was making an assessment some time ago would be the earliest time that we would be able to field the national missile defense. 
   So everybody--in the media, on this floor and just about everywhere--has  now taken the common wisdom that the 2005 date is when the national intelligence estimate says the threat will arrive. 
   That is not what the national intelligence estimate is. The threat is any time when a three-stage Taepo Dong II could deliver a several-hundred-kilogram payload anywhere in the United States. And that day is when they next test it. 
   With the general point my good friend from Massachusetts is making, I happen to agree with what he is saying. I certainly support the good Senator from Illinois on his amendment, but I think we ought to try to change the wisdom which has evolved around that date or the assumption or the press coverage of that date. 
   Everybody uses that date for the wrong reason. Whether it is possible to reverse it, correct it, I don't know. But I think it would help the debate a great deal if we were able to look at that date for what it is, which is the first date that the Secretary of Defense thought, at the time he made the assessment some months ago, that a national missile defense could possibly be deployed.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from Illinois for this amendment. It is a very important amendment. It really shows congressional interest in an area which is going to require a great deal of attention. That is the statement of General Welch himself, which my good friend from Virginia just read. 
   I want to reread one of the lines in the Welch report, which is that: ``more advanced decoy suites are likely to escalate the discrimination challenge. The mid-course phase BMD concept used in the current national missile defense program has important architectural advantages. At the same time, that concept requires critical attention to potential countermeasure challenges.'' 
   The countermeasures issue requires critical attention. 
   What the Senator from Illinois is saying is that the Congress should pay some attention to this, not just the executive branch. I have no doubt, and my good friend from Virginia has no doubt, Secretary Cohen will pay attention to this. We do not know if the next Secretary of Defense will be as interested in this issue--we hope he will be--as this Secretary. 
   But the fact that the executive branch is doing something has never prevented the Congress from putting something into law. We have had Presidents who have had Executive orders that we agree with, that we repeat in law. Why would we hesitate to simply express our own view, show congressional interest, and reinforce something which hopefully the Defense Department will continue to do? So it is not unusual for us to direct something. I think we ought to adopt this amendment overwhelmingly. 
   This is a very complicated system. The Senator from Virginia pointed out that a few of our colleagues voted against the Cochran bill. Almost all of us voted in favor of it. One part of the  Cochran bill said it should be our national policy--it is our national policy--to deploy a system when ``technologically feasible'' or words to that effect. 
   But there is another provision in the Cochran bill which was added by amendment, by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, which I cosponsored, which said that it is also the policy of the United States to seek to continue to reduce, by negotiations, the number of nuclear weapons in this world. That is also the policy of the United States. 
   We have two policies--a policy to deploy a limited missile defense and a policy to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. What happens when those two policies clash is unresolved in the Cochran bill. 
   We must continue on both those courses. If there is a conflict between deploying a limited defense, after it is technologically proven--assuming it is--and reducing the number of nuclear weapons through continuing negotiations, if there is a conflict--as there apparently is at the moment, since Russia says she will not reduce further nuclear weapons if we are going to unilaterally deploy a national missile defense--if and when there is such a conflict, that conflict will have to be resolved under the circumstances at that time. 
   So I think the Senator from Massachusetts was very proper in using the term ``we'' because many of us supported the Missile Defense Act because of the presence of a number of policies, both to deploy a system when technologically feasible, subject to appropriation, as well as to reduce, through negotiations, the number of nuclear weapons in this world. 
   This amendment is a commonsense, fly-before-you-buy amendment. It is consistent with the Senate's traditions. And it is something we have almost always required. 
   The few times we have deviated from the fly-before-you-buy approach, we have paid heavily for it, at least in a number of those instances. We should test against countermeasures. We are testing against countermeasures. This amendment simply says that it wants the Welch panel to be reauthorized, to continue in existence, to report to the Congress on defenses against countermeasures. 
   Finally, I will reread the one line which I think is so important from the Welch panel: The national missile defense program requires critical attention to potential countermeasures challenges. 
   That says it all to me. The current system does not address future countermeasure threats. It only addresses the so-called C-1 threat, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out. There are going to be in the future much more sophisticated countermeasures which this system has to be able to address or else it won't make sense to deploy. That is what we would be going on record as saying we believe is important. We would be doing what the Welch panel says is important: paying critical attention to potential countermeasures challenges, saying that the Congress cares about this issue, that it makes sense to us that as part of any decision of operational effectiveness, that there be testing against reasonably likely countermeasures that could be faced by a national missile defense. 
   I am glad my good friend from Virginia believes this is kind of a commonsense amendment, that it reinforces what the Secretary is already doing. I think it is very appropriate for Congress to do exactly that, to show our support when we do support something that is done by the executive branch and to state our opinion on the subject, and to put it in law so the next Secretary of Defense realizes it is in law and that there is congressional interest in the subject.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor today and support the nomination of a very talented and a highly qualified member of the Armed Services Committee staff to be the Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs of the newly created National Nuclear Security Administration. 
   Madelyn Creedon has served her country for her entire professional life in a variety of important national security positions. She has served as Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy, working closely and directly with Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis. She was the general counsel for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, and she has served as minority counsel to the Committee on Armed Services and counsel under my predecessor, Senator Sam Nunn. She spent 10 years as a trial attorney in the Department of Energy. 
   Madelyn Creedon's nomination for this important position was unanimously reported to the full Senate by the Armed Services Committee on April 13. After working with her for more than 8 years on the Armed Services Committee, I know firsthand of her extraordinary understanding of the national security programs of the Department of Energy and of her passionate commitment to the success of these programs and to the national security of the United States. 
   There are few people who have Madelyn Creedon's depth of experience and her knowledge in the nuclear weapons programs of the Department of Energy. 
   Last month the Senate confirmed the nomination of Gen. John Gordon to be the Under Secretary of the Department of Energy and the head of the new National Nuclear Security Administration. All of us are aware of the significant challenges General Gordon is facing in this position. The Administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Administration is responsible for maintaining the safety, security and reliability of our Nation's nuclear warheads; for managing the Department of Energy laboratories; for cleaning up some of the worst environmental problems in the country; and for addressing security problems that continue to undermine pubic confidence in the Department of Energy. As one of the senior deputies in the National Nuclear Security Administration, Madelyn Creedon's knowledge and experience in all of these areas will be of great assistance in helping General Gordon address the challenges he is facing. 
   I had a discussion with General Gordon last week. He told me that he wants Madelyn Creedon to be his deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, and he is anxious for Madelyn Creedon to get to work as his Deputy Administrator. 
   Madelyn Creedon is well known and respected by Senators on both sides of the aisle. Prior to her confirmation hearing in the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER and I received a letter from Senator LUGAR. I would like to quote just a few sentences from Senator LUGAR's letter:  
   As you know, Mr. Chairman, I am a strong supporter of U.S. nonproliferation efforts in the former Soviet Union. These programs have continually garnered bipartisan support because of the outstanding efforts of dedicated Members of Congress and staff on both sides of the aisle. Madelyn's efforts in this area have made tremendous contributions to the successful implementation of these important programs. Her oversight and legislative analyses of these programs have improved our country's national security. I am confident that she will provide the same level of expertise and dedication if confirmed as Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at the Department of Energy. 
   It is with great enthusiasm that I offer my strong support for Madelyn's nomination, and I am hopeful that members of the Armed Services Committee and the full Senate will concur.

   Mr. LEVIN. If confirmed today, I understand that Madelyn Creedon will be the first woman to be placed in charge of the safety and reliability of America's nuclear deterrent. I cannot imagine any individual who would be better qualified to handle this awesome responsibility. We will miss Madelyn Creedon on the Armed Services Committee, but I think we all know that the committee's and the Senate's loss will be the country's gain.  
   In closing, I first thank Madelyn Creedon for her dedicated service on the staff of the Armed Services Committee. I congratulate her on her nomination by the President to this important position in the Department of Energy. Finally, I thank Madelyn Creedon for her continued willingness to serve the country. And I thank her family--her husband Jim, her daughter Meredith, and her son John--for their sacrifices in supporting her in this demanding position.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend from New Mexico for support of the Creedon nomination. It is important his support be there and his voting for her is a very significant step on his part. I know how deeply involved he is in the issue and how hard he fought for the creation of the semiautonomous agency, the National Nuclear Security Administration. She has satisfactorily assured him and all of us she will fully carry out this law. 
   As a matter of fact, when she was helping the staff when this bill was in the Senate, she helped us work out the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 97-1. The good Senator from New Mexico was very much in the forefront of that effort to create the bipartisan effort that we successfully created in the Senate. Again, there was only one vote against the bill as it passed the Senate, and she helped us perfect that bill. I want to give her some credit. 
   Perhaps even more importantly, the responsibility of whatever bumps that have been along this road are ours, not hers, because she staffs us. Just the way we want her to be the right arm of General Gordon, so she has been staffing us as well and carried out that role very well. 
   We are, as Senators, responsible for our staff's work. If there is disagreement on this with some of the difficulties in creation of this particular semiautonomous agency or in the way it has been implemented, those disagreements lie with the Secretary of Energy or, to the extent they are legislative, lie with perhaps some Senators but not surely with our staffs who are carrying out our wishes, as we want and expect her to carry out General Gordon's wishes.

   Mr. LEVIN. It is a fair assessment, and I think General Gordon is ready to have Madelyn there assisting him and will be a big boost. That is what he told me on the phone. The Senator from New Mexico recounted a conversation with General Gordon. I had a similar conversation with him. I wanted to be sure he truly wanted Madelyn Creedon because he was not the administrator at the time that nomination was forthcoming. I wanted to be sure he was, in fact, desirous of having her as his deputy, and he is so desirous and very much supports the nomination. We now can proceed to that vote, and, hopefully, she will receive an overwhelming vote of support.

   Mr. LEVIN. I will just use one of my minutes to fill in part of the record, and then we want to proceed to a vote. 
   Madelyn Creedon has also served as Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy for National Security Programs. It is a very important part of her background where she worked directly with then-Deputy Secretary of Energy Charles Curtis. In addition to being minority counsel for the Armed Services Committee, she served as counsel under my predecessor, Senator Nunn, when he was chairman of the committee. 
   So there are some additional important facets of her experience. As the Senator from Arizona mentioned, and as the Senator from New Mexico mentioned, General Gordon, who is the new person to run the agency, to run this new semiautonomous entity, specifically told me not just that he has no objection, but he supports her being both appointed and confirmed, and he had no objection to my putting it that way. 
   So the person for whom we have voted and confirmed overwhelmingly to run this semiautonomous agency is anxious to get her on board and very much supports her nomination and confirmation. 
   With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators MCCAIN, FEINGOLD and LIEBERMAN in voting to send to the President H.R. 4762, a bill that hopefully will lead to closing one of the gaping loopholes in our Federal campaign finance laws. I use the words ``lead to'' because we aren't closing the so-called 527 loophole here today--we are forcing the disclosure of the contributors who use the loophole. Just as the disclosure of soft money hasn't yet ended the soft money loophole, this disclosure won't automatically close the 527 loophole. Most of our reform work lies ahead. But, our action today will hopefully give us momentum toward ending both the Section 527 loophole and the soft money loophole. 
   Having been in the Senate over 20 years, now, I've witnessed how slow and frustrating the legislative process can be, and I've also witnessed how we as an institution can come together quickly and directly when we see a compelling need to do so. Senators LIEBERMAN, DASCHLE, MCCAIN, FEINGOLD and I introduced legislation in the Senate, similar to H.R. 4762, in April of this year. With the upcoming November elections we were ever aware of the explosion in sham issue ad campaigns by anonymous contributors across the country that the public was going to experience this year without Section 527 reform. We wanted to beat the clock and get this legislation in place in time to have an effect on this year's campaigns. 
   With the leadership of a committed group in the House, and a significant bipartisan majority supporting such reform in the Senate, we have been able to do that. I commend the many dedicated House members and Senators who worked to bring this vote about over the past few weeks. The reforms we are passing today will have a meaningful effect on the campaigns being run this year. 
   The Section 527 loophole allows undisclosed, unlimited contributions. These are stealth contributions--tens of millions of dollars of stealth contributions that are off the campaign finance radar screen. How does that happen--that an organization that claims--on its own--to exist for the purpose of influencing an election can receive unlimited contributions and kept them secret? Well, it happens because these organizations seeking a tax exemption under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Service Code say one thing to the IRS to get the tax exemption and say the opposite to the Federal Election Commission to avoid having to register as a political committee. 
   The Internal Revenue Service Code defines an organization subject to a tax exemption under Section 527 as an organization, ``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State or local public office .....'' The Federal Election Campaign Act defines a political committee which is subject to regulation by the FEC and that means disclosure as an organization that spends or receives money ``for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'' So people creating these organizations are claiming, with a straight face, that they are trying to influence an election in order to get the benefits of one agency while representing they are not trying to influence an election in order to avoid the requirements of another. We often say, ``You can't have it both ways,'' but persons forming these organizations, Mr. President, turn that saying on its head. They are, so far, having it both ways, and our campaign finance system and the respect and trust of the American people in our elections and government are paying the price. 
   Section 527 was created by Congress in the 1970's to provide a category of tax exempt organizations for political parties and political committees. While contributions to a political party or political committee are not tax deductible, Congress did provide for a tax exemption for money contributed and spent on political activities by an organization created for the purpose of influencing elections. At the time Congress established the tax exemption, it assumed that such organizations would be filing with the FEC under the campaign finance laws for the obvious reason that the language for both coverage by the IRS and coverage by the FEC were the same--``influencing an election.'' Consequently it was assumed that Section 527 didn't need to require disclosure with the IRS, since the FEC disclosure was considerably more complete. 
   The legislation before us would require Section 527 organizations to file a tax return, something they are not required to do now, and disclose the basic information about their organization as well as their contributors over $200. 
   As good and important as this bill is, however, it does not stop the unlimited aspect of these secret contributions, nor the unlimited contributions permitted through the soft money loophole. This victory today is but one battle in the overall campaign to enact the McCain-Feingold bill, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to make that happen.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is just simply wrong that Americans are forced to pay extraordinarily high prices for prescription drugs and then have to cross the border to Canada and Mexico to buy those drugs manufactured in the United States at far lower prices. It is simply wrong. But it is doubly wrong when the U.S. taxpayers have paid for part of the research that produced those very same prescription drugs. 
   Many of us have constituents who go to Canada just for this purpose; they are unable to afford prescription drugs here in the United States. Sometimes they go great distances to cross the border to Canada or to Mexico in order to buy prescription drugs at prices they can afford. 
   We did a survey of a number of prescription drugs. These are seven of the most popular prescription drugs. We took a look at those seven drugs and then did a survey of the cost of those prescription drugs in Michigan and in Ontario across the border. Premarin, $23.24 in Michigan, $10.04 in Ontario; Synthroid, $13 compared to $8; Prozac, $82 compared to $43; Prilosec, $111 compared to $48; Zithromax, $48 compared  to $28; Lipitor, $63 compared to $42; Norvasc, $76 compared to $41. 
   When particularly seniors--sometimes by the busload--gather together, drive to a border point, and cross the border to get a 30- or 60-day supply of prescriptions, and then come back into Michigan or other States with prescription drugs that they cannot afford to buy in their own hometown, something is fundamentally wrong with that system. 
   These are the percentages of those top seven drugs. The U.S. prices are above the Canadian prices based on that survey. That was a survey of prices in Detroit compared to Ontario across the border. 
   For the first one, Premarin, the U.S. price is 131 percent higher than the Canadian price; Synthroid is 63 percent higher than for Ontario purchasers; Prozac is 878 percent higher for Americans than for Canadians; Prilosec is 132 percent higher; for Zithromax, Americans are paying 674 percent more than Canadians; Lipitor is 51 percent more than for Canadians; and Norvasc is 783 percent more than for Canadians. 
   That is unconscionable. It is wrong. It is infuriating. It is costly. We have to do something to change the system that allows this to happen. But it is doubly wrong when U.S. taxpayers have paid for part of the research that produced those very same prescription drugs. 
   I don't know which of these particular prescription drugs were produced with U.S. taxpayer dollars or partly with U.S. taxpayer dollars. I don't have that data. But that is not the point of the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. For the drugs produced with U.S. taxpayer dollars, there should be an agreement that the manufacturer will charge a fair price as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   That is a very reasonable approach, it seems to me. There are other approaches which have been suggested to address this issue. I think there are other approaches also worthy of consideration. But the approach before us today is an approach which I believe is eminently fair, which simply says if you want to use taxpayer dollars in your research, that you make sure your pricing system is fair to Americans who helped to fund that very research. 
   I hope we will adopt the amendment of the Senator from 
   Minnesota. I think it is a fair approach. It is based on the contribution Americans have made to the creation of the very prescription drugs which too many Americans find they cannot afford. 
   We want pharmaceutical companies to be profitable. We want pharmaceutical companies to engage in robust research and development. But we do not and should not, as Americans, pay the share of research and development that consumers in other countries should be shouldering. We can't afford to subsidize other countries, and it is particularly wrong where we have originally done some of the subsidy of the very research and development which produced the drug which is now sold for so much less in those other countries. 
   I commend the Senator from Minnesota. I support his amendment. I hope we will adopt it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) released a new report about the illegal firearms market. The ATF's report documents 1,530 criminal investigations involving firearms traffickers for the time period between July 1996 and December 1998. These trafficking investigations led to the recovery of more than 84,000 illegal firearms and the prosecution of more than 1,700 defendants. 
   The ATF report provides significant insight in to the gun trafficking trade. The investigation reveals that too many loopholes in our national framework for firearms distribution permits traffickers to divert legal guns to the illegal marketplace. The vulnerabilities in our law, identified by the ATF, are a result of corrupt federal firearms licensees, who were associated with only 10 percent of the investigations in the report but accounted for nearly half of the firearms involved, a staggering 40,000 guns; gun shows, which supplied channels for 26,000 guns, the second highest number of illegally trafficked firearms in the investigation; straw purchasers, who bought and transferred firearms to unlicensed sellers or prohibited users; unlicensed sellers, who were not required to conduct Brady background checks or maintain records of their sales; and firearms theft. 
   Mr. President, we can no longer afford to ignore the deficiencies in our federal firearm laws. Gun trafficking gives criminal users and young people access to tens of thousands of illegal guns. If Congress wants to reduce firearm trafficking, then first and foremost, we must close the gun show loophole. Secretary Lawrence Summers, who oversees the ATF explained ``This report . . . shows that we must do more to close every trafficking channel, starting with closing the gun show loophole . . .'' Furthermore, we must increase criminal penalties for traffickers and crack down on corrupt federal firearms licensees, straw purchasers, and unlicensed sellers. I urge Congress to pay attention to this report and pass sensible gun measures that will end the deadly flow of firearms to the illegal marketplace.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the real leaders in this effort, Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD. They have been extraordinary in their tenacity. We look forward to their continuing tenacity to close two egregious loopholes--the one we are closing through this bill, and the other one is the soft money loophole. 
   I thank Senator LIEBERMAN for his leadership in terms of the 527 loophole itself. We are about to take a step on a long journey. It is a journey to bring back some limits on campaign contributions. Those limits have been destroyed by two loopholes: The soft money loophole and the so-called 527 loophole. 
   We are about to shed some light, pour some sunshine on the 527 loophole. And the public will respond, I believe, when they see just how egregious this loophole is. When the disclosure required by this bill becomes law--as it will--the public will respond to the unlimited contributions which are also hidden. That disclosure, I believe, will lead to the closure of this loophole. And for that, we commend the leaders in this effort. 
   It is an ongoing struggle. It can only be said to be successful when the soft money loophole is closed, and when the 527 loophole is not just brought out into the sunshine but, hopefully, when it shrivels away and is closed because the public wants the restoration of limits on campaign contributions. They want them disclosed, but they want them limited. 
   We have taken the important step of disclosure relative to one of those loopholes, and for that we have to thank Senators MCCAIN, FEINGOLD, and LIEBERMAN. I very much express the gratitude of a bipartisan coalition to all of them.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when six-year old Kayla Rolland, from Mt. Morris Township, Michigan, was shot by a fellow classmate, it moved most Americans to tears. Months later, the tears dried and the images faded from view for some, while others turned those tears into action. Of course, the most active group has been the Million Moms, who marched in my home state of Michigan and around the country to demonstrate for safer, more sensible gun laws. 
   The mothers and others marched on Mothers' Day, 2000 because they are fed up with Congress and our continual failure to pass responsible gun measures that will help protect America's children. Since the school shooting in Colorado, and the more recent one in Michigan, Congress has failed to act, so Americans have started to take gun safety into their own hands. One of those Americans is Joe Yax of Midland, Michigan. 
   Mr. Yax was driven to action by the school shooting of Kayla Rolland. Yax said he felt nauseated when he first heard news of the shooting, and immediately thought of his own young children, and the unlocked guns he kept at home. Yax told the press that he had always planned to purchase locking devices for his guns, but he never found the time. When young Kayla was shot, not only did Mr. Yax find the time to purchase trigger locks to make his own children safer, Mr. Yax, who is a store employee of the Midwest superstore, Meijer, e-mailed the company's president to see how he could make his community safer.  
   As a result of that e-mail, Meijer, which does not sell guns, but does sell ammunition, hunting licenses and other supplies, implemented a gun safety campaign at all of their stores. Sporting-good employees now wear buttons reading, ``Is your home gun safe? Trigger lock `em'' and trigger locks are displayed prominently at the sporting-goods counter. In addition, Meijer reduced the price of trigger locking devices to encourage more purchases. 
   I am pleased that Joe Yax took this initiative, and I think he and Meijer should be commended for their efforts. Corporate responsibility is a necessity if we are going to reduce gun violence. Nevertheless, while Mr. Yax did what he could to improve gun safety, it is not enough. It's time for Congress to follow the lead of Mr. Yax and act to make sure our own children--America's children--are safer.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation being introduced today by my friend from Wisconsin to address a problem that is unique to certain areas of Wisconsin and Michigan. 
   In the Cities of Grand Rapids and Battle Creek, Michigan and in several Wisconsin communities, certain individual Citizens Band (CB) radio operators are using illegal equipment of a capacity which interferes with the home electronic equipment and telephone service of their neighbors. 
   As a result, these neighbors are forced to buy filters in order to screen out the interference, and in some cases the interference is so extreme that the filters don't even work. There have also been complaints that some of these ``illegal'' CB broadcasters are using profanity which is disturbing to the neighbors and interfering with legitimate use of CB radios by truckers and others. 
   The problem is exacerbated by a lack of Federal resources to stop the problem. In recent years, due to budget and staffing cuts, the FCC has decreased its enforcement efforts. The legislation being introduced today would authorize local jurisdictions to enforce the  FCC regulations regarding use of citizens band radio equipment, while maintaining the FCC jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. 
   The bill provides for an FCC appeal process available to any person who believes they are adversely affected by local enforcement action. FCC does not object to this approach or to this legislation. 
   Mr. President, this legislation offers a simple solution to the inability of the FCC, due to insufficient resources, to put a stop to illegal CB equipment use in parts of Michigan and Wisconsin. The legislation would allow local officials, who are more familiar with the specific problems and complaints in their areas of jurisdiction, to be authorized to enforce FCC regulations regarding the use of CB radio equipment. The legislation has the strong support of local government officials in the Michigan communities where CB interference occurs. 
   An identical bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives. I hope this legislation will be enacted in an expedited manner so that local officials will have the ability to stop the use of illegal CB equipment that is interfering with legitimate CB use and disturbing citizens of the impacted communities.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I reluctantly oppose the Wellstone amendment to transfer $225 million from the military purposes of Plan Colombia to domestic substance abuse programs. The passage of this amendment would endanger the success of the Administration's plan to attempt to prevent the democratic government of Colombia from being destroyed by narco-traffickers. While I strongly support the goal of allocating additional funding to substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, this cannot be achieved at the expense of the effectiveness of Plan Colombia. 
   In solving the difficult problem of drug abuse and its many negative effects, the United States must seek a balanced approach. This approach must include funding for not only drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, but also for international eradication/interdiction and local law enforcement. Plan Colombia, which stresses eradication and interdiction of narcotics at their source, is a useful part of our nation's overall strategy to end drug abuse. 
   Colombia now supplies approximately 80 percent of the cocaine and heroin consumed in the United States. The Plan Columbia aid package, which has been designed by the Administration and the Colombian government, is  a comprehensive attempt to stem this flow of narcotics. The package includes important funding for counter-narcotics support, economic development, and human rights programs. 
   A particularly important goal of this initiative is the promotion and protection of human rights in the Andean Region. In this respect, the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations bill makes important contributions. The bill provides approximately $138 million in funding for efforts to protect human rights, strengthen the judicial system in Colombia, and support peace initiatives. In addition, all assistance to Colombian armed forces is contingent on a screening of security forces to ensure that they have not been implicated in human rights violations. 
   Drug abuse has taken a terrible toll on our country. It has led to increased levels of crime, a clogged judicial system, and most dramatically, the ruined lives of our nation's citizens and their families. It is for this reason that I am committed to effective drug abuse and treatment. I have worked hard to win Senate passage of legislation which would enable qualified physicians, under strict conditions, to prescribe new anti-addiction medications aimed at suppressing heroin addiction. I have also strongly supported government funding for state and local community-based programs for drug treatment. In Fiscal Year 1999, the federal government spent approximately $5.6 billion on domestic programs directed at the reduction of drug demand.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington and Senator SNOWE. They have been doing an important job for the Nation. 
   We require an awful lot from the service men and women who serve us here and abroad. We ask them to volunteer to serve in the military. Then we send them all over the world to serve our Nation's interests. When we ask them to serve in foreign countries, the least we can do is to ensure they receive medical care equal to what they would receive in the United States. Servicewomen and their dependents who are fortunate enough to be stationed in the United States and who make the difficult decision to have an abortion can, at their own expense, get a legal abortion performed by a doctor in a modern, safe, American medical facility with people who speak English. Military women stationed overseas do not have that opportunity under current law. 
   That is what the Snowe-Murray amendment would change. The alternative of seeking an abortion from a host nation doctor who may or may not be trained to U.S. standards in a foreign facility where the staff may not even speak English is an unacceptable alternative. 
   Our servicewomen deserve better. 
   This amendment is not about conferring a fringe benefit on military  women. It is, rather, a vote to remove a barrier to fair treatment of women in the military. This amendment does not require the Department of Defense to pay for abortions. As the Senator from Washington very clearly explained again, all the expenses would be paid for by those who seek the abortion. 
   The Defense Department calculates the cost of medical procedures in military health care facilities all the time. They routinely compute the cost of health care provided to military members and their families when seeking reimbursement, for instance, from insurance companies. Medical care, for instance, provided to a beneficiary who is injured in an automobile accident is routinely reimbursed by the insurance company of the driver at fault. 
   To say that we cannot calculate the indirect costs of medical care to the Government is simply not an accurate statement of what takes place already. The Defense Department calculates costs--direct and indirect--to the Government right now when it charges a third party for reimbursement. 
   There is no requirement in this bill--quite the opposite--that the Government pay for the abortion. It makes it very clear that the person who seeks the abortion must pay for the abortion. 
   Finally, we have heard about military doctors who have said in the past that they did not want to perform abortions. We heard one of our colleagues say that doctor after doctor said they did not want to perform an abortion. 
   That is why this amendment provides that abortions could only be performed by American military doctors who volunteer to perform abortions. 
   This amendment is about whether or not women who serve in the military are going to be treated as second-class citizens. That is what this amendment is about--whether it is going to be made more difficult for them when serving us abroad to exercise a constitutional right which the Supreme Court has conferred. 
   It is very intriguing to me that the opponents of this amendment speak about a woman being able to receive transportation back to this country. They don't seem to object to that; quite the opposite. They say: Look, we are making Government-provided transportation available to the woman. Why isn't the same objection being made to that? 
   The answer is because denial of access to a military hospital abroad for an American woman who chooses to have an abortion does not facilitate that procedure. And the opponents of this amendment, as a matter of fact, oppose this procedure. They want to make it more difficult. And forcing a woman to ask a commander to have leave and then, if transportation is going to be made available, provide transportation back to the United States to have an abortion, and then back across the ocean overseas, clearly makes it more difficult and in many cases more dangerous for that woman to have the procedure. 
   That is what this debate is all about. It is not about whether the Government is going to pay for the abortion or whether this is a fringe benefit. It is not. The woman must pay for it in that hospital by a doctor who voluntarily agrees to perform it. 
   This amendment is about whether or not we wish to remove a barrier which has been placed in front of a woman who chooses to 
   exercise, at her own expense, that constitutional right. 
   I hope the votes will be here this time to remove this badge of second-class citizenship which now exists in the law which unduly, unfairly, and sometimes dangerously restricts the right of a woman who is serving us in our military to exercise her constitutional right. 
   I again thank my friend from Washington for her leadership. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Captain Joseph P. Avveduti who is retiring from the U.S. Navy in July after thirty years of outstanding service to our nation. From September 1995 to August 1996, Avveduti commanded the U.S.S. Kalamazoo. This ship is named after Kalamazoo, Michigan and the history of its service is of particular interest to Michigan residents. 
   Captain Avveduti graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1974. Following his graduation he was designated a Naval Aviator and went on to command several Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadrons. Among his many leadership positions, Captain Avveduti served as the Executive Officer of U.S.S. Independence from January 1993 to June 1995. In 1997, Captain Avveduti graduated from the National War College in Washington, D.C. He currently holds the Chief of Naval Operations Chair at that institution where he serves as a great role model for the many young men and women in the Navy. During his career, Captain Avveduti received the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, the Air Medal and various campaign and service medals. 
   Mr. President, Captain Joseph Avveduti's service to the U.S. Navy, and in particular his command of the U.S.S. Kalamazoo, is to be commended. The United States will lose a respected and well accomplished naval officer upon Captain Avveduti's retirement. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Captain Avveduti on his outstanding service.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Kennedy proposal has two major provisions. First, it strengthens current law as it relates to hate crimes based on race, religion and nation origin. Second, it broadens the definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, and disability. 
   The two major provisions in the Kennedy amendment address specific loopholes in our current federal civil rights statute. Under current law, the federal government is limited in its ability to intervene in case unless it can be proved that the victim was engaged in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected activities,'' such as enrolling in a public school, participating in a state or local program or activity, applying for or enjoying employment, serving as a juror, traveling in or using interstate commerce, and enjoying certain places of public accommodation. 
   The other unduly severe limitation under current law is this: federal prosecution is limited to those crimes motivated by race, color, religion and national origin and does not allow for federal intervention in crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   The Senate has the ability and the responsibility to pass the Kennedy amendment and send a clear message that America is an all-inclusive nation--one that does not tolerate acts of violence based on bigotry and discrimination. 
   Hate crimes are a special threat in a society founded on ``liberty and justice for all.'' Too many acts of violence and bigotry in the last years have put our nation's commitment to diversity in jeopardy. When Matthew Shepard, a gay student was severely beaten and left for dead or James Byrd, Jr. was dragged to death behind a pick-up truck, it was not only destructive for the victims and their families, but damaging to the victims' communities, and to our American ideals. 
   When a member of the Aryan Nations walked into a Jewish Community Center day school and fired more than 70 rounds from his Uzi submachine gun, then killed a Filipino-American federal worker because he was considered a ``target of opportunity,'' it not only affected the families of the victims but all those who share the traits of the targeted individuals. 
   In a united voice, we must not only condemn these acts of violence that terrorize Americans every day, but act against them. America's agenda will remain unfinished so long as incidents like those occur and statistics like the following threaten our people. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, at least one hate crime occurs each hour. These are often acts of violence, not threats, verbal-abuse or hate speech, but criminal offenses. 
   In 1998, there were 7,755 incidents involving 9,722 victims. Of those incidents, approximately 56 percent were motivated by racial bias; 18 percent by religious bias; 16 percent by sexual-orientation bias; and the remainder by ethnicity/national origin bias, disability and multiple biases, and prejudices and hate. 
   In my own home state of Michigan, according to the State Police, there were 578 hate crimes in the same year. According to Donald Cohen, director of Michigan's Anti-Defamation League, racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic activity is on the rise. In October of 1998, Cohen, who monitors hate crimes for his organization said ``I can say I have seen more hate-group material circulated ..... in the last few months than I have seen in the prior two years.'' 
   As a result, civil rights and law enforcement officials, who were concerned about the rise of hate crimes in Michigan moved to counter them by founding the Michigan Alliance Against Hate Crimes. The Alliance is a statewide coalition working to provide support to victims of hate crimes and to identify, combat and eliminate such crimes. 
   The group was already in place last September, when this crime was committed in Grand Rapids, Michigan: a 30-year-old white man, Charles Raab, beat unconscious an African-American man, Willie Jarrett, ran him over with a car three times and dragged him with the car for 80 feet, before he dislodged the victim and fled the scene. Witnesses said that during the scene, the attacker used racial slurs to describe his victim--who suffered wounds to his back, hands, chest, and shoulders, and had half of his ear torn off. 
   The Michigan Alliance Against Hate Crimes immediately assembled a ``rapid response team'' and worked with the local prosecutor to charge Raab, the attacker, under the Ethnic Intimidation Act--Michigan's hate crime law. In the end, Raab pleaded guilty to the charges against him and was sentenced to seven to twenty-five years in prison for the attack. 
   The city of Grand Rapids, along with the Michigan Alliance Against Hate Crimes, made sure that the perpetrator of this heinous hate crime was prosecuted to the extent of the law. Unfortunately, not all hate crimes are prosecuted so successfully. There are several states without such Alliances and hate crimes are not prosecuted with success either because state or local authorities do not have adequate resources or personnel; state and local authorities aren't as incensed as they should be or decline to act for other reasons. 
   In some cases, state or local authorities simply don't have jurisdiction to prosecute hate crime cases: 42 states have hate crime statutes but only 21 cover sexual orientation and disability and 22 cover gender. Michigan's Ethnic Intimidation Act, for example, is limited to crimes incited by a person's race, color, religion, gender or national origin, and does not include crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation or disability. 
   The FBI Statistics show that the number of reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation is third only to those based on racial bias and religious bias. 
   My home state of Michigan has had its share of hate crimes based on sexual  orientation. Last summer, an 18-year-old boy leaving a gay nightclub in Grand Rapids, Michigan was met by an attacker who was waiting outside the club in a car. The assailant jumped the young man and slashed his face with a razor blade hospitalizing him for over a week. His face is permanently scarred. 
   A few weeks ago in Detroit, a gay man was buying cigarettes at a gas station late at night and a car full of men pulled up, accosted him and asked if he was gay. When he just walked away the men became infuriated and beat him badly, shattering his skull and putting him in a coma for several days. The assailants have not been arrested. 
   A gay man driving in Royal Oak, Michigan was allegedly harassed and intimidated by four other motorists in a nearby car. The assailants were screaming anti-gay epithets and succeeded in running him off the road and destroying his car. The assailants then screamed at the man, spit on him, and kicked in his window. 
   The police officer investigating the case allegedly asked multiple questions about the driver's sexual orientation and sexual activity rather than the details of the accident. The four assailants were never charged and despite the fact that witnesses and crime specialists reconstructed the scene as told by the driver, the driver was convicted of reckless driving. Local media and community leaders were outraged and called it a miscarriage of justice. 
   This and other such stories are examples of crimes that not only affect the fundamental rights of the victim, but deprive that victim of a sense of security and self worth. These crimes are just as damaging as those motivated by race or religion, but state authorities are limited in their ability to respond because Michigan's hate crimes statute is inadequate. 
   Congress has the opportunity to take action against these and other hate crimes, which go unprosecuted at the state level, with the passage of the Kennedy hate crimes amendment. This amendment would expand the federal definition of hate crimes to include crime motivated by a person's sexual orientation, gender or disability adding to the current list of attacks motivated by race, color, religion or national origin. 
   The Kennedy amendment would also broaden the federal government's authority to prosecute any hate crime based on race, color, religion or national origin. Currently, federal prosecution of hate crimes is limited and U.S. attorneys have had difficulties prosecuting cases--that state authorities are unwilling or unable to prosecute--because of the need to prove that the victim of a hate crime was also targeted because of his participation in one of six specified federally protected activities. The statute's severe restrictions has prevented the federal government from prosecuting perpetrators of some of the most egregious hate crimes. 
   For example, in recent years a jury acquitted three white supremacists who had assaulted African-Americans. After the trial, some of the jurors revealed that they felt racial animus had been established but did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show that the defendants intended to prevent the victims from engaging in a narrowly defined federally protected activity that the statute had provided. 
   The Kennedy amendment will not make every hate crime a federal crime. Almost all hate crimes will remain the primary responsibility of sate and local law enforcement agencies. For these cases, broadening federal authority will permit joint federal-state investigations and may be useful to state and local authorities who will be able to rely on investigatory and prosecutorial assiatnce from the Department of Justice. The Kennedy amendment makes grants of up to $100,000 available to state and local law enforcement agencies who have incurred extraordinary expenses associated with investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. 
   For the few hate crimes that the Justice Department does act to make federal crimes, the Department will be required to use its authority sparingly, as is required with the existing authority to prosecute crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred. Prior to federally indicting someone, the Justice Department must certify and there is reasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivitated by bias and the U.S. attorney has consulted with the state or local law enforcement officials and determined one of the following situations is present, 
   under the Kennedy amendment, to show we are not creating under this amendment a situation where the Federal Government is going to be prosecuting every hate crime. There are still restrictions built in here to rely more heavily on State and local law enforcement. If one of the following situations is present, then the U.S. attorney, under certain circumstances at least, would be authorized to proceed: 
   No. 1, the state does not have jurisdiction or does not intend to exercise jurisdiction; 
   No. 2, the state has requested that the federal government assume jurisdiction; 
   No. 3, the state does not object to the federal government assuming jurisdiction; 
   No. 4, or the state has completed prosecution and the verdict or sentence obtained under state law left demonstratively unvindicated the federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence. 
   In addition, for crimes based on the three new categories--gender, sexual orientation, and disability, and in some instances, for crimes based on religion and national origin--the Kennedy amendment provides that the Federal Government must prove an interstate commerce connection showing that: 
   No. 1, the defendant or the victim traveled across state lines; 
   No. 2, the defendant or the victim used a channel, facility, or instrumentality of commerce; 
   No. 3, the defendant used a firearm, explosive, incendiary device or other weapon that has traveled in commerce, or 
   No. 4, the conduct interferes with commercial or other economic activity in which the victim is engaged at the time of conduct. 
   Stated simply, the Kennedy hate crimes amendment will allow for more effective and just prosecutions of hate crimes. The alternative, the Hatch proposal, which will be before the Senate, neither addresses the problems with existing law--that the victim must be engaged in a narrowly specified federally protected activity; nor does it address the limited definition of a hate crime--which excludes sexual orientation, disability, and gender. 
   More than 175 law enforcement, civil rights, civic and religious groups as well as 22 State Attorneys General support the Kennedy amendment, and the role it gives the federal government to prosecute individuals who have committed violent acts resulting from racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic motives. This legislation is also supported by the Justice Department, and is compliant with the recent Supreme Court decision United States v. Morrison. In a June 13, 2000 letter to Senator KENNEDY, the Justice Department stated clearly that the amendment ``would be constitutional under governing Supreme Court precedents'' 
   Passage of this amendment will send the message that we are a country that treasures equality and tolerance. We will not condone the hate crimes that have plagued our nation and have had such a devastating impact on the families of Matthew Shepard, James Byrd, Jr. and too many others. I hope my colleagues will support the Kennedy amendment. This amendment will bring us closer to the time when all Americans have equal opportunities, and perpetrators of hate crimes receive swift and vigorous prosecution.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we recognize the date upon which slavery finally came to an end in the United States, June 19, 1865, also known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was on this date that slaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Although passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in January 1863, legally abolished slavery, many African Americans remained in servitude due to the slow dissemination of this news across the country. 
   Since that time, over 130 years ago, the descendants of slaves have observed this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of the most tragic periods of our nation's history. The suffering, degradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again on American soil. 
   Mr. President, throughout the Nation, we also celebrate the many important achievements of former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as a way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, faith and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the betterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity towards them. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History Month. And, every year on June 19, we celebrate ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' 
   Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer recently reflected on the life and times of Dr. Woodson. In an article he wrote earlier this year for Johnson's Publications, Bennett tells us that one of the most inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West Virginia to the summit of academic achievement:  
   At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.  
   In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I would like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home state of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American injustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who would change the course of history. 
   Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights movement are indelibly echoed in the chronicle of not only the history of this Nation, but are viewed with distinction and admiration throughout the world. 
   Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one of the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the inhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the abolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of equality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, Michigan on September 25, 1999. 
   Truth lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, helping slaves who had fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. She returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there until her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions is that her words continue to speak to us today. 
   On May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which authorized the President of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and respect by us all. 
   Forty-four years ago in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American people but the entire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 
   We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for all. But we still have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle on Civil Rights and to human rights.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Senators from Maine and New York for this resolution. Because it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which might be ruled not to be germane or appropriate on this bill for technical or procedural reasons, I understand they will be withdrawing it. I am sorry that is what they must do under our rules, or need to do under our rules, because this resolution of theirs really addresses one of the most critical issues my constituents in Michigan are facing. I know the Senator's constituents in Maine are facing it, and the constituents of the Senator from New York. All of our constituents are facing these skyrocketing prices which have no rational explanation--except that the oil companies have decided they are going to gouge us pricewise, although their own prices of oil per barrel have not gone up nearly as much as have the prices that they are charging us. 
   We have had two agencies of this Government that have said there is no logical or rational explanation for the huge increase in gas prices. The Federal Trade Commission should investigate this matter. I have asked them to investigate this matter because of the possibility of anticompetitive practices on the part of the oil and gas industry. That is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. Their staff, indeed, is required to undertake that inquiry. 
   What is going on here is intolerable. It is not a 
   reflection of the price of oil per barrel. The prices at the pump have gone up far more, proportionally. In the absence of that kind of explanation, and in the presence of the kind of skyrocketing prices we are facing at the pump, as the Senator from Maine said--in the Midwest, in my State, now over $2 a gallon--I think the signal which is being sent by this resolution is a very important one. The letter they are sending I hope will get the signatures of every Member of this body. I have already sent the President a similar letter urging the withdrawal of some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the later swap of oil back into that reserve. I intend to sign this letter again because I think the more of us who ask this administration to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the better, and the more likely they would do so. 
   I commend the two Senators for their action. I intend to forcefully join with them in their letter and to continue my own efforts, as previously indicated both with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain their investigation for potential anticompetitive practices, as well as the withdrawal issue by the Department of Energy, because I believe that is one of the ways we can fight back against the OPEC monopoly.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Illinois for his comments. As always, he has his finger on the pulse of his constituents. That is the No. 1 issue with the people of Michigan at the moment, the skyrocketing price of gas at the pump. There is not even a close second. This is the first, second, and third issue on the minds of the people of Michigan and the Midwest, and obviously other parts of the country as well. We have to hold the oil companies accountable. We have to put as much pressure on them as we can. Withdrawing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is one of the ways in which we can fight back against these skyrocketing prices.

Included in the Senate Committee Report is the statement: State of Michigan buses and bus facilities: Despite unanimous supported agreements among the Michigan Public Transit Association, its members, and the Michigan Department of Transportation that Section 5309 bus funds to Michigan transit agencies be distributed through MDOT, designations of funds to individual transit agencies continue to be sought and proposed apart from the agreement. The Committee directs that any fiscal year 2001 discretionary bus funds for projects in Michigan be distributed through MDOT in accordance with the MPTA-MDOT agreement. 
   I have spoken with many local jurisdictions who do not agree that there has been an agreement that all money would go to the Michigan Department of Transportation and that there would be no specific earmarks.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the CAFE law, which the House of Representatives very properly has kept on the shelf--is a bill with many flaws. I am just going to focus briefly on a couple of those flaws. 
   First, the CAFE law, as it is written, and which would be put back into force, does not allow for the consideration of some very highly relevant factors that should be considered in the regulatory process. One of these is safety. Senator ASHCROFT--and I believe Senator ABRAHAM--have also made reference to analyses of losses of life that have resulted from lighter vehicles. 
   There has been a study and analysis, which has been referred to at some length, by USA Today which shows that 46,000 people have died because of the CAFE law who otherwise would not have died. I want to read very briefly from this article:  
   ..... in the 24 years since a landmark law to conserve fuel, big cars have shrunk to less-safe sizes and small cars have poured onto roads. As a result, 46,000 people have died in crashes they would have survived in bigger, heavier cars.  
   This is according to the USA Today's analysis of crash data since 1975, when  the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed. 
   The Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards it imposed have improved fuel efficiency. The average of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads is 20 miles per gallon versus 14 in 1975. But the cost has been roughly 7,700 deaths for every mile per gallon gained, the analysis shows. 
   These figures can be disputed, although this is a very lengthy and very objective analysis in the USA Today of July 2, 1999.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have heard already one speaker contest some of the facts that are set forth in the USA Today article. But it seems to me that, at a minimum, it is relevant to discuss the question of safety, to study the question of safety, to look at whether or not there are additional traffic deaths that result from lighter cars. Surely, at a minimum, any law which seeks to regulate in this area should look at the kind of analysis which has been done-which shows 46,000 people have died. 
   Now, I am not an expert in this area. I don't know if 46,000 people have died or not. I do know that serious objective analysis by serious objective people have reached that conclusion and the CAFE law, which would be triggered into effect unless this freeze is continued, as the House of Representatives proposes, doesn't allow for consideration of safety. 
   It seems to me that any regulatory process should look at all of the costs and all of the benefits before we regulate. But when we look at the CAFE laws that would be put back into effect unless the position of the House of Representatives is adopted, they require that at least 18 months before the beginning of each model year, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe by regulation--this isn't optional, this is mandatory--shall prescribe by regulation a standard which shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the manufacturers can achieve in that model year. 
   None of the four or five factors listed in the law that should be considered on decisions on maximum feasible average fuel economy has to do with safety. It seems to me that kind of a narrow approach, which is just focused on some of the factors which should go into the regulatory process, is not the kind of approach which a proper regulatory process should adopt. 
   I emphasize that the CAFE law isn't a study. This is a mandate. 
   No. 1, every year there must be a decision by the Department of Transportation as to the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the model year, and it is mandatory. 
   No. 2, it does not provide for consideration of highly relevant factors. 
   I have no problem myself with a study that looks at all the relevant factors. Quite the opposite. I think it is perfectly appropriate, provided we don't prejudge the outcome of the study and lift the freeze before we find out what the outcome of the study is. I don't have any problem with a study that looks at all of the factors objectively and then makes a recommendation. 
   I have plenty of problems with telling any agency of this Government that, based on a restricted list of relevant factors, they should mandate something every year on the automobile manufacturers. That excludes this current law. This CAFE law excludes highly relevant factors that should be considered. 
   That is point No. 1. 
   At the top of the list of considerations is the question of safety. 
   In addition to that, we have in this law which, in my judgment, unfairly discriminates against the U.S. automobile industry. That includes both the manufacturers and the people who manufacture parts. 
   I would like to give one example of what I mean. 
   Take two vehicles. These are two sport utility vehicles--the GM Sierra and Toyota Tundra. Both of these vehicles are about the same weight. One of them is slightly more fuel efficient than the other; that is, the GM Sierra. But the way the CAFE law is designed it has absolutely no impact on the imports. It has a huge impact on domestic manufacturers. 
   Because of the way the CAFE law is written, even though the GM vehicle is slightly more fuel efficient than the Toyota vehicle, Toyota can sell 309,000 of those Tundras without any penalty. GM can't sell one of its vehicles without a penalty. 
   It seems to me that this kind of disparate impact has to be looked at. No study worth its salt, and no study that is worthy of being called objective or fair, could ignore the disparate impact which the CAFE law has added. If it is put back into effect, it will continue to have a discriminatory effect on the American automobile manufacturers because of the way it is designed. It doesn't look at each vehicle weight class. Instead, it looks at the manufacturer and its total fleet. 
   The result is that you have some manufacturers producing vehicles no more efficient than other manufacturers that have absolutely no effective limit on what they can sell--you have the other manufacturers--and it is the American manufacturer--that are discriminatorily impacted because of the nature of their fleet. 
   The American-made vehicles are just as fuel efficient, or perhaps slightly more fuel efficient. Yet they have to pay the price in terms of loss of market share. They have to pay a penalty. They have no room to sell vehicles the same weight as the imports can sell with no effective limits whatsoever. 
   People can give the arguments on the other side of this issue. That is fair enough. But the problem is--if I am right, and I believe I am right--that the discriminatory impact on the  American manufacturers and parts producers cannot be taken into consideration as part of the annual CAFE imposition. That is not on the list of things that go into the definition of ``feasible average fuel economy'' because the Secretary is told that he or she must prescribe the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy,'' and then defines it in such a way that it excludes the discriminatory impact of the CAFE law on American manufacturers. 
   The CAFE law is flawed in many ways. It has some very negative consequences, in my judgment, and in the judgment of others in terms of safety, loss of life and discriminatory impact on American automobile manufacturers and parts producers. 
   One other thing: Not only do the imports have this huge amount of room to sell their heavy vehicles while General Motors, using this particular analysis, cannot sell any without penalty, but they can also bank so-called ``credits'' under the CAFE law. Because they can bank credits--again, we are comparing vehicles that are the same weight where the GM vehicle is slightly more fuel efficient--then because of the way in which the law is designed, Toyota could sell 1.6 million of those vehicles without any penalty; General Motors, none. 
   This is the original 309,000 that I made reference to, and these are the addition of so-called ``banked credits.'' 
   There are many discriminatory, disparate, and, I hope, unintended consequences of CAFE. But I wasn't here in the early seventies when this law was drafted. I can only say I hope the consequences which I described are unintended. 
   The better approach to this entire issue, it seems to me, is for Government and the private sector to cooperate in a partnership for a new generation of vehicles. That is what is now underway. That partnership is producing some extraordinarily positive results. 
   That research approach-that voluntary cooperative partnership- harnesses the ingenuity and the energy of business, partially funded with the Government, to achieve the policy goal which we all want--which is more fuel-efficient cars, and cars that are also safer. And we don't want at the same time to unfairly damage the American automobile industry. 
   How much time does this Senator have left on his 15 minutes?

   Mr. LEVIN. The better alternative for increasing SUV and light truck fuel economy from both an environmental and equity perspective is aggressive investment in fuel efficiency research projects. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, PNGV, provides an example of the pay-off from programs that harness the energy and ingenuity of government and business to achieve this policy goal. 
   The goal of PNGV is to improve national manufacturing competitiveness, implement technologies that increase the fuel efficiency of and improve emissions for conventional vehicles, and develop technologies for a new class of vehicles with up to 80 mpg without sacrificing the affordability, utility, safety, and comfort of today's midsize family sedans. 
   For the five years that this program has existed (it is currently in its sixth year), the average annual government contribution has been about $250 million per year. The average annual private sector contribution by the Big Three has been in excess of $900 million per year. 
   PNGV fuel-efficient technologies, such as lightweight materials, advanced batteries, and fuel cell and hybrid electric propulsion systems, are already appearing on experimental concept vehicles shown by automakers at recent auto shows. 
   Under PNGV, U.S. automakers will have production-ready prototypes by 2004. Some of the technology from this aggressive research will be transferable to the light duty truck fleet. 
   I urge Members to vote against this resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   In addition, one of the specific factors in the study we look at is ``the disparate impact, if any, on the U.S. automotive sector.'' Then it issues the words, ``and any other factors deemed relevant by the National Academy of Sciences or the committee of conference.'' 
   My question to the Senator from Washington is whether or not in his judgment the fairly lengthy list of factors which are relevant to this question, which are set forth in Senate bill 2685, a bill which was introduced, I believe, by Senators ASHCROFT and ABRAHAM, myself, and a number of others, whether in his judgment those factors would be included as being relevant in any study?

   Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps our recollection is different, but I am not sure it makes a major difference. My recollection is in the original draft of this motion, the Senator from Washington had used the word ``recommend.'' I may be wrong on this, but this is my recollection, which I have shared with my good friend from Nevada so we are all straight with each other, as we always are. 
   The word at some point was changed to ``proposed,'' and then a number of us on this side of the issue urged the word ``recommend" be used instead of ``proposed'' to avoid any implication that this was a proposed rulemaking. That was the reason that word did have some relevance. There is no intention here that there be a proposed rulemaking which be authorized in any way by this motion. The word ``proposed'' could create an implication which was unintended, whereas the word ``recommend'' does not have that implication. 
   That was my recollection. If I am wrong on that, then I certainly want my friend from Nevada to know historically that was my recollection, and that is what I represented to him.

   Mr. LEVIN. That question, of whether the words ``recommend" or ``proposed,'' in any event, was explicitly discussed among all of us who were involved in this revised motion, and it was 
   important to those of us who opposed the original motion that the word ``recommend'' be used for the reason I just gave. 
   If the recollection of the Senator from Washington is the word ``proposed'' originally was made by me, if in fact that is true, so be it. That is not my recollection. Nonetheless, it did become an issue in discussion whether the word be ``proposed" or ``recommend,'' and it became important to those of us opposing the motion that the word ``recommend'' be used to avoid that implication which everybody said was not intended.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that effort would be made, as I understand it, immediately following the vote on the confirmation of General Gordon. I am just wondering if that is accurate, so we can inform our colleagues who have an interest in this that the effort which the Senator from Virginia, the manager of the bill, has just described would occur immediately following the vote on the confirmation of General Gordon.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from North Dakota will yield. 
   First, I join Senator WARNER in thanking him for allowing, with such graciousness, as always, the interruption of his presentation. 
   Secondly, he has a very important amendment. It is an amendment on which this Senate has voted, and this vehicle is a perfectly legitimate vehicle for legislation. It is one of the few opportunities we have for legislation. It is because there are such few opportunities that it has attracted this many potential amendments. I do not think anyone needs to apologize for that. 
   Senator WARNER--the way he works so well--and I will attempt to work with him and attempt to accommodate Senators who wish to offer amendments to this legislation. They need no apologies. We will try to work through it. 
   I thank the Senator from North Dakota for not just intending to offer an important amendment again, but being willing to take a very short time agreement on it, which means we can move the bill along.

   Mr. LEVIN. If my good friend will yield for a comment on that, I happen to share with him the desirability of moving this bill, but I also understand the need of colleagues to offer legislation in the Senate. That is why we are here. 
   The way I would accomplish the goal which the good Senator from Virginia has just laid out--a goal I share--would be to encourage colleagues who feel strongly about amendments, as the  Senator from North Dakota does, and understandably so, to agree to short time agreements. The shorter the time agreement we can get on some of these amendments, particularly amendments which have been debated for a long time before, is a way in which we can expedite the passage of the bill, and that is the way in which I think effectively we can do that.

   Mr. LEVIN. I can think of amendments on both sides that could require extensive debate, but there may be occasions where cloture is an appropriate way in this Senate. We have rules for that. With some of these amendments which have been waiting to be offered for so many months, I think the best way to do it is deal with them within the rules of the Senate. Happily, this is not one of those amendments. We should not in any way suggest the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota is involved in that particular issue. 
   He is willing to take a short time agreement. I think we ought to put that in the bank, get this amendment up early, and dispose of it.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I join with Senator WARNER in supporting the President's nomination of Gen. John Gordon to be the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security in the Department of Energy, and the first administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Agency in the Department of Energy. 
   General Gordon is an excellent choice to fill this very demanding position. General Gordon has served his country for more than 30 years, most recently as the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He was recommended for this position by a panel of highly qualified experts headed by former Deputy Secretary of Energy Charles Curtis. 
   It is hard to imagine an individual with more experience than General Gordon with all aspects of the nuclear forces of the United States. During his long and distinguished career in the United States Air Force, General Gordon worked in the research and development of nuclear weapons programs as a physicist and technician; he is familiar with the operational requirements of our nuclear forces from his tours of duty with U.S. strategic missile forces, including service as vice commander and commander of a Strategic Missile Wing; and he worked at the highest policy levels of the Executive Branch during his four years on the National Security Council as special assistant to the President for national security affairs and senior director for defense policy and arms control. 
   Upon confirmation, General Gordon will take on one of the most challenging assignments in the federal government. The Administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Administration is responsible for maintaining the safety and reliability of our nation's nuclear warheads; for addressing security problems that continue to undermine public confidence in the Department of Energy; for managing the Department of Energy laboratories; and for cleaning up some of the worst environmental problems in the country. 
   Moreover, the Administrator will face these assignments as the head of an agency so plagued with ``convoluted, confusing and contradictory'' reporting channels that the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board last year characterized the entire Department of Energy as a ``dysfunctional'' organization. Although I believe that some of the legislation Congress has passed and is currently considering will make General Gordon's job harder and not easier, I pledge to work with General Gordon, Secretary Richardson and my colleagues in the Congress to do everything I can to give General Gordon the support he will need to be successful in this demanding job. 
   I think all of us appreciate General Gordon's willingness to serve his country on this continuing basis and to take on a very difficult assignment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will shortly pass H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements Act of 1999. This bill was passed by the House on August 2, 1999. 
   The Small Business Administration's 504 loan program provides 20- and 10-year fixed-rate loans to small businesses through Certified Development Companies to be used for the acquisition or renovation of plant and equipment. SBA's 504 program loans are funded through the sale of pooled debentures on the bond market which gives small businesses access to interest rates that are close to those offered to large corporations. 
   SBA's 504 loan program is a net plus to our economy because it requires that small businesses receiving loans must create jobs or retain jobs that otherwise would be lost and/or meet certain national public policy goals. The 504 loan program's job creation track record has been excellent, with at least 3 jobs being created for every $35,000 in 504 lending provided. 
   This legislation is most urgently needed because the 504 program needs to be reauthorized. Even though the program costs the Government nothing and no appropriations are made to fund it because the program pays for itself through fees collected from borrowers, it cannot continue to operate without an authorization. We cannot allow this to happen. The 504 loan program is too important to small businesses who wish to expand because it provides affordable financing for growth with low down payments which is often difficult or impossible for small businesses to obtain from traditional lenders. 
   This bill improves on the 504 loan program and increases the maximum amount of a regular SBA guaranteed debenture, long term bond, from $750,000 to $1 million. The maximum amount for loans with specific public policy purposes, low-income, rural and minority-owned businesses, is increased to $1,300,000. There has not been an adjustment to the maximum loan level in 10 years and this change allows the program to keep up with inflation that has occurred over that time period. It also adds women-owned businesses to the category of public policy goals that the program aims to achieve, making women-owned businesses eligible for the higher levels of financing. This is an important addition due to the significant role women-owned businesses play in contributing to job growth in our economy. The bill also reauthorizes the program for 3 more years and makes two pilot programs permanent. 
   The State of Michigan has many active CDCs which keep in close touch with my office to report on their activities and the small businesses they have helped. On their behalf and on behalf of all the small businesses assisted by the 504 loan program and those that will be assisted in the future, I commend my colleagues for passing this legislation which improves on an already outstanding program.

   Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point, General Gordon has very strong support on both sides of the aisle. He is a Presidential nominee who has gotten a very positive response from just about everybody I know. I think the people look forward to voting on his nomination as early as possible tomorrow morning. 
   Again, I think there is an effort being made to set a deadline for another vote on a nominee to the same Department, someone who has been waiting for a long time.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire, and yet Congress is refusing to act on sensible gun legislation. Until we act, one of us who is trying to get legislation passed will read the names of those who lost their lives through gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day while the Senate is in session. In this way, we hope to remember those who have died and to bring closer the day when fewer die from gun violence. 
   Following are the names of some of the Americans who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago today, on June 12, 1999:  
   Tyrand Baxter, 24, Atlanta, GA; 
   D'Ante Bonds, 18, Oakland, CA;

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished managers of the bill in a brief colloquy on the issue of the health care management demonstration program recommended by the Armed Services Committee in S. 2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   Section 740 of S. 2549 would direct the Secretary of Defense to conduct a test of two models to improve health care delivery in the Defense Health Program: one model would study alternative delivery policies, processes, organization and technologies; the second would study long term disease management. This section would also  authorize $6 million within the total of $11.4 billion authorized for the Defense Health Program in FY2001 to carry out these demonstration programs. The Armed Services Committee believes that these two models have the potential to improve significantly the delivery of health care in the military medical system. 
   I would like to ask the distinguished managers of the bill if the FY2001 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill currently before the Senate includes the resources in the Defense Health Program to conduct the health care management demonstration program directed by section 740 of S. 2549?

Mr. President, I commend our good friend from Minnesota not just for his good nature but also for his continuing to bring to the attention of the Senate and the Nation the problem addressed in his amendment, and his determination that he get a review of the impact of the actions that we have taken on poor people in this country. He has been in the leadership of this effort continually. He raises this issue with his extraordinarily powerful and eloquent voice. I commend him for that. We will be accepting the amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senators WARNER and DODD for their work on a bipartisan basis to establish a bipartisan commission on Cuba. It is important that we conduct a review of the achievements or lack thereof of the embargo. The amendment does not presume the outcome in any way of the commission's effort. It is not intended nor should it be interpreted for a substitute for any other legislative action that Congress might take. 
   It is constructive. It is bipartisan. It is modest. I think it is, frankly, long overdue. I hope we can adopt this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the section 527 loophole is driving elections and their financing deeper and deeper into the muck. We cannot stand by with the values we hold as Americans and watch elections driven deeper and deeper into the muck. That is what is happening with this 527 loophole. It is tearing this system to shreds. The soft money loophole has already cut a huge hole in the campaign finance system. This section 527 loophole just simply tears this system to shreds. It allows unlimited contributions and, even worse than the soft money loophole, it allows undisclosed unlimited contributions, stealth contributions, and the press reports already tens of millions of dollars of these contributions are totally off the campaign finance radar screen. 
   The only way people can use this is by trying to take inconsistent positions on two laws. The Internal Revenue Code defines an organization subject to tax exemption under section 527 as an organization which influences or attempts to influence the election of any individual to any Federal office. 
   That seems pretty clear. The Federal Election Campaign Act defines a political committee which is subject to regulation by the Federal Election Commission as an organization that spends or receives money for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office. 
   People are creating these 527 organizations because, and only because, they influence or attempt to influence an election. That is why they are exempt but then ignore the FEC's requirements that people who organize for the purpose of influencing an election have to disclose. 
   We cannot in good conscience stand by and permit this process, this charade, which is doing so much damage to the public, to continue. 
   On this so-called blue-slip question, first, the Senate should not agree to a House interpretation that something like this is a revenue raiser when it is not a revenue raiser. We should not simply accede to that, No. 1. That is a broad interpretation which the House uses to have a larger prerogative than the Constitution provides. 
   Secondly, we do not know that there is going to be a blue slip. We do not know that. The House, I believe, has to adopt a position. This is not something which is done informally. 
   Thirdly, if the House does blue-slip this matter, there is plenty of precedent for the matter then coming back to the Senate and the Senate removing the language in question. 
   This is being used as an excuse not to adopt a critically essential amendment if we are going to even begin to restore public confidence in the elections in this country. 
   This last suggestion by our good friend, the chairman, that there could be, instead of a law being passed, sense-of-the-Senate language which is not law, is not binding, does not have the force of law, but even in its own language simply suggests to organizations that they adopt some meaningful disclosure of activity, is meaningless, not meaningful. We should not stand by and permit this charade to go on any longer. 
   While we do not know the universe of these organizations, because they do not even have to register with the Internal Revenue Service, we do know that this is a bipartisan problem that requires and deserves a bipartisan solution. 
   Section 527 was created by Congress in the 1970s to provide a category of tax exempt organizations for political parties and political committees. While contributions to a political party or political committee are not tax deductible, Congress did provide for a tax exemption for money contributed and spent on political activities by an organization created for the purpose of influencing elections. At the time Congress established the tax exemption, it assumed that such organizations would be filing with the FEC under the campaign finance laws for the obvious reason that the language for both coverage by the IRS and coverage by the FEC were the same--``influencing an election.'' Consequently, it was assumed that section 527 did not need to require disclosure with the IRS, since the FEC disclosure was considerably more complete. 
   The amendment before us would require section 527 organizations to file a tax return, something they are not required to do now, and disclose the basic information about their organization as well as their contributors over $200. 
   In late January of this year, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation released a study of the Disclosure Provisions Relating to Tax-Exempt Organizations. In that study, the bipartisan staff addressed section 527 organizations, and the JCT staff recommended adoption of an amendment to section 527 similar to the language we now have before us. The JCT staff specifically recommended: 
   1. That 527 organizations be required to ``disclose information relating to their activities to the public .....'' 
   2. And that 527 organizations ``be required to file an annual return even if the organizations do not have taxable income and that the annual return should be expanded to include more information regarding the activities of the organization. 
   The JCT report said, ``This recommendation is consistent with the recommendation that all tax returns relating to tax-exempt organizations should be disclosable.'' 
   As the 2000 campaign evolves that we get closer to November, the American public is going to be seeing the consequences--the real life consequences of this loophole in our campaign finance laws. Candidates from both parties are going to be hit with ads by groups with names that sound like civic organizations but which in reality are nothing more than well-financed political opponents whose sole purpose is to influence an election. But the public will not be able to determine who the people are behind the organizational name. It could be one person, one union, one corporation, or an association of unions, interest groups, or corporations. An organization with a name like Citizens for Safety could have as its sole contributor a leader of organized crime. We would never know. The examples are endless. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Unfortunately, it does not stop the unlimited aspect of these secret contributions, but it does bring these contributions out in the open.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last weekend, a new report was released by the Justice Department about the successes of the Brady Law. The Brady Law requires that a prospective gun purchaser undergo a criminal background check before obtaining any firearm from a federal firearms licensee. The law is intended to prevent felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and other prohibited persons from gaining access to guns. The new information brought the number of purchase rejections up to more than half a million since enactment of the Brady Law in 1994. 
   According to the report, the number one reason for rejection was because the applicant either had a felony conviction or was under felony indictment. Of the approximately 200,000 purchase rejections in 1999, almost three-quarters, or 150,000 were denied for this reason. The second most common cause for rejection was a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction or restraining order, accounting for approximately 13% of rejections or 27,000 applications. Other applicants were denied the ability to purchase guns because of fugitive status, mental illness or disability, drug addiction, or state or local prohibition. In total, in 1999 alone, the Brady Law kept more than 200,000 guns off the streets and out of the hands of prohibited purchasers. 
   The Brady Act has been effective but its success has been undermined by a loophole in the law that allows criminals to purchase guns from non-licensed sellers. That loophole allows felons, fugitives or other prohibited persons to purchase guns at gun shows without undergoing background checks. It is a loophole often exploited by those with objectionable backgrounds, some of whose applications have already been rejected by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies. 
   Congress made significant strides to reduce the level of gun violence by enacting the Brady Act, but now it's time to finish the job. Congress must close the gunshow loophole, otherwise the successes of Brady are weakened. As a reporter in my home state of Michigan said yesterday, ``the same statistics that demonstrate the usefulness of the background checks that have been in place since passage of the Brady bill cry out for closure of the loopholes that allow criminals turned away by licensed dealers to purchase guns with impunity elsewhere.'' 
   I urge Congress to close the gun show loophole and stop undermining law enforcement's ability to keep guns off the  streets and out of the hands of dangerous criminals.

As my dear friend from Virginia mentioned last night, there were an awful lot of heroes and heroines--obviously, veterans first and foremost, but a lot of folks here at home. And this memorial is to them. We have now nine World War II veterans remaining, I believe, in the Senate; is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. 
   I must say, I am utterly amazed by the last answer of my good friend from Virginia. What the Senator from Virginia said is that President Bush carefully, after thorough deliberation and consideration, negotiated a START II treaty. That was done, to use my good friend's words: After the studies were done, after the work was done. 
   I am wondering if my friend from Nebraska would agree with what I am now going to say. The law that is on the books will not let us go down to the Bush START II level, which was so carefully negotiated. 
   Think about what our law is. We just heard--and I agree with the good Senator from Virginia--that President Bush carefully, thoughtfully, in the words of the Senator from Virginia, after the studies were done and the work was done, negotiated a START II treaty. I agree with that. The law on the books will not let us go to the level that President Bush negotiated. We have to stay at START I levels.

   Mr. LEVIN. You cannot have it both ways. If President Bush thoughtfully--and he did--carefully--and he did--after work was done--and it was--negotiated a START II level--we have ratified START II--the Joint Chiefs want us to go to that level and have testified to that, that we are wasting money staying at the START I level--we have peacekeepers that we can't afford to maintain; it is wasteful--they say, please don't force us to keep to that level, but we have a law on the books which says we have to stay 
   at the START I level of 6,000 warheads. We cannot go down to the START II level of 3,000 to 3,500 warheads because of the law on the books. You can't have this both ways. 
   To add insult to injury, now we are saying that the only way that can be waived, that limit, that START I requirement that we have on the books, is if there is another Nuclear Posture Review. We have had two very thoughtful, Nuclear Posture Reviews, one in 1994, one in 1997. 
   You will not let us implement it. This law will not let us implement the previous careful, thoughtful Nuclear Posture Reviews. I do not have any problem with another one, by the way. I do not have any problem with the bill the way it now reads. 
   The problem I have is with the Warner amendment, which says that we can't do what we negotiated in START II, even though it has been confirmed by two thoughtful posture statements, unless the President--the next President, not this one--first has another Nuclear Posture Review. That is the problem. 
   I think the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Virginia is aimed very clearly at this President. I think it is a mistake in terms of its approach. It is being limited to hobble this President, to force him to maintain a force structure which was negotiated to a lower level by a previous President. I think that is a mistake in terms of precedent and in terms of what we should be doing in terms of a body. It should not be aimed at one President. 
   But in addition to that, I must say that we are maintaining a force structure which the Joint Chiefs say we do not need, a force structure which START II--which was negotiated by President Bush--says we do not need. So we are wasting a lot of money as well as engaging, I believe, in a partisan effort to hobble the President. 
   That is the sad news. That is one of the problems with the Warner amendment. But there is some good news--not in this amendment, but there is some good news that should give us a little bit of comfort. 
   It will not work. We can waste money. We are. We can maintain a dangerous level of force structure, for the reasons which the Senator from Nebraska gave, making us less secure, not more. We can do all that. But we cannot hobble the President, although I believe the intent of this amendment is to hobble this President. I believe that is the intent because it is only aimed at this President. 
   The next President--whether it is a Democratic or Republican President--we have been told last night, can go through this review in a matter of months, if they want to, and then waive this statute, but not this President. So I think it is aimed at this President. But this President has the constitutional right to negotiate a treaty, should he see fit. Thank God, the Constitution is there again to save us. 
   Because although this language will not allow a waiver by this President to get down to the level which President Bush negotiated, and which the Joint Chiefs of Staff say is all we need to keep us secure--half of the level which the current law forces us to maintain--even though that is what this language will force us to do, it cannot stop the President from carrying out his constitutional duty to his last day in office. 
   He can negotiate a treaty at a lower level. If he does so, we can reject it. The Senate has to ratify under the Constitution. But the President is nonetheless able to negotiate reductions below the START II level, as the Joint Chiefs have said he safely can. 
   In 1997, the Joint Chiefs said we can safely go down to 2,000, 2,500, which is about 1,000 below the START II level. They have already said that after a careful posture review. I hope the President succeeds in coming up with a treaty which allows us to deploy a limited national missile defense at a lower level of nuclear weapons. I hope he succeeds. 
   But I must say this amendment is not constructive. It is not something which I believe would be offered were a President of a different party in office. I do not believe that it would be offered. I think the answers last night give support to that conclusion. 
   It is a very sad conclusion on my part to reach that because I know my friend from Virginia is not ordinarily of that bent. We have worked together long enough so I know what his instincts usually are. But in this case, I am afraid it falls short of where we should be as a body, which should be supporting our right to ratify, supporting a force structure we need, but not maintaining a force structure we no longer need according to two careful posture reviews, for purposes which I believe are intended to restrict this President. 
   Before I yield the floor, I ask the Senator from Nebraska, is it not accurate that the START II level which was negotiated by President Bush was supported by a Nuclear Posture Review made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff?

   Mr. LEVIN. On the point of the President signing five bills, when the President signs bills--these bills are 600 pages long--he makes it very clear he doesn't agree with every single provision in every bill he signs. As a matter of fact, if that were the test, I am sure we could get a statement right now from the President indicating his opposition to this provision. I would think the Senator from Virginia would still not drop this provision, even though the President of the United States would indicate opposition to it. 
   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, speaking for the administration, I am sure, in 1995, said:  
   Our analysis shows that, even under the worst conditions, the START II force levels provide enough survivable forces and survivable, sustained command and control to accomplish our targeting objectives.  
   That is the Joint Chiefs speaking for the administration in 1995. The current law will not allow this administration to go down to the levels which General Shalikashvili and the current Joint Chiefs say are adequate. It is wasteful as well as attempting to hobble the President. But if the test is whether the President supports the language or not, I am sure we can get a quick letter from the President indicating his opposition to the Senator's amendment. I wonder whether the Senator would drop his amendment if the President indicated opposition in a letter?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a co-sponsor of the Kerrey amendment and urge the Senate to adopt this important amendment. 
   Current law prohibits the U.S. from reducing its strategic nuclear delivery systems below START I levels. This law requires the U.S. to stay at START I levels--to maintain 6000 nuclear warheads, until START II enters into force. This law was enacted, in 1996, just 16 months after the START II treaty was signed. The amendment offered by Senator KERREY will repeal this law which is neither needed or helpful. 
   The START II treaty allows the U.S. to reduce the number of nuclear warheads to 3000-3500, but the law requires that we maintain 6000 warheads. We do not need 6000 thousand warheads and we do not need this law. 
   The Department of Defense has consistently argued that the law is not necessary. When asked his view about this provision, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, was clear: ``I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that mandates specific force structure levels.'' General Shelton made it clear that the Chiefs also oppose this provision: ``The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider options that will reduce the strategic forces to the levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I legislative restraint will need to be removed before we can pursue these options. Major costs will be incurred if we remain at START I levels.'' We have already spent millions staying at the START I, 6000 warhead level. For instance, we are unnecessarily spending to maintain the 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs. 
   The Nuclear Posture Review, conducted in 1994, reaffirmed that the U.S. did not need 6000 warheads and that the START I level of 3000-3500 warheads was adequate. General Shalikashvili stated, in 1995, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee that ``Our analysis shows that even under the worst conditions the START II force levels (3000-3500 warheads) provide enough survivable forces, and survivable, sustained command and control to accomplish our targeting objectives.'' 
   It is ironic that Governor Bush criticizes the Clinton administration for ``remain(ing) in a Cold War mentality'' and for failing ``to bring the U.S. force structure into the post-Cold War world'' when it is this law, put in place by Congress, that requires staying in the Cold War mentality. 
   If this law is not repealed now, it will tie the hands of the next President, the next Secretary of Defense, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
   The Warner second degree amendment would require the U.S. to stay at the START I 6000 warhead level for at least another 18 months. Even though there is general agreement that we need to go below the START I level of 6000 warheads, the Warner amendment would keep the U.S. at this high warhead level, even though the 3000-3500 START II level has been reviewed and validated repeatedly and continually since 1992 when the START II Treaty was signed. 
   In 1994 the DOD conducted a comprehensive Nuclear Posture Review that validated the START II force structure levels--3000-3500 warheads. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review carefully reviewed and affirmed that the START II nuclear force structure was appropriate to protect U.S. national security requirements. In 1997, in preparation for discussions in Helsinki between the United States and Russia, the DOD and the Joint Chiefs again reviewed nuclear force structure levels and determined that an even lower force structure level at the proposed START III level of 2000-2500 warheads was adequate. 
   Just last month, in extensive testimony before the Armed Services Committee, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Commander of the Strategic Command testified that the 2000-2500 warhead level proposed for START III level was adequate to meet U.S. military requirements. Only Congress is still stuck at a START I force structure levels. 
   In light of the nuclear force structure reviews that have been conducted since START II was signed, it is clear that force structure levels will be at or below START II levels of 3000-3500 warheads. Why do we have to wait another 18 months to go below the START I force structure level--a level that no one seriously argues should be maintained? 
   Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is a simple amendment to repeal a law whose time and usefulness has past. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the request for our colleagues to contact the cloakrooms about their intentions relative to amendments and speaking on the bill. It will help us to organize the rest of the time we will need on the bill. 
   I particularly thank Senator REID. He has been working hard on our side. I know that kind of effort is being made also on the Republican side to see if we cannot come up with a finite list at the end of the day of amendments that Members intend to offer.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my staff just handed me some interesting statistics, since we have a moment. Over the last 10 years, we have averaged 5 1/2 days on the Defense authorization bill and 116 amendments, on average. We are actually doing pretty well. We are making some progress. We may beat the average even. We never know.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again, it is necessary for Senator MCCAIN and I and a number of colleagues he has specified to make an effort to authorize an additional two rounds of base closings. On this issue, the Congress simply can run but it cannot hide. 
   Every time we speak about the need for additional resources, be it for health care in the military for retirees or active duty people, whether it is for modern equipment, whether it is for a reasonable, decent cost-of-living allowance or a pay increase for our active duty people, whatever it is we talk about as being needed in our military, it seems to me to be a little bit hollow if we are not willing to make the savings that clearly are essential and can be made and are requested by our uniform military to help pay for those additional expenditures. We can run but we simply cannot hide from our responsibilities in this area. 
   The amendment would implement the recommendation of the Quadrennial Defense Review. We have heard a lot about Quadrennial Defense Review today and how important it is that review take place, and it is important. The recommendation of the Quadrennial Defense Review was that we have additional rounds of base closings. The National Defense Panel recommended additional rounds of base closings. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended additional rounds of base closings. The Secretary of Defense has made the same recommendation. 
   The way to respond to the need for resources for our military is to eliminate the expenditures which are not essential. 
   This amendment would authorize two base-closure rounds: one in 2003 and one in 2005. The first round would take place well into the next administration. The second round would take place in 
   the administration after that. 
   The amendment Senator MCCAIN and I and others are offering would follow the base-closure process that was used previously in 1991, 1993, and 1995, with three main exceptions: First, because 2005--which is the second round under this amendment--will be the first year of a new administration, the schedule in 2005, which again would be the second round, would start and end about 2  months behind the schedule that would be used in 2003. The 2003 schedule would basically mirror the 1995 schedule, except that it would start and end about 2 weeks later than in 1995. We include a 2-month slip in the timetable of the whole process in 2005 to allow a new administration time to decide whether they want to have a base-closure process and to make its appointments to the commission. 
   As our friend from Arizona pointed out, this process we would authorize is simply that--we authorize the process. The President would decide whether or not to trigger the process by the appointments of the members of the base-closing commission and then would have a fail-safe mechanism to reject the recommendations of the commission. 
   The second exception to the general rules that were followed in the last rounds' process is this amendment also includes the language to address the problem of privatization in place for future BRAC rounds. It would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize in place the workload of a closing military installation only when it is specifically recommended by the Base Closure Commission. That would address the issue which has been raised about the previous round when some thought that round was politicized when there was privatization in place, which was allowed. This cures that problem by saying no privatization in place unless the Base Closure Commission itself specifically recommends that course of action. 
   The third main difference between this and the previous rounds is that this amendment specifies we look at the costs and savings not just of the one agency but total costs and savings to the Federal Government. That is important so that we do not simply save money in one Federal Government pocket but cost money in another Federal Government pocket; that we look at the costs and the savings to the entire Government from a proposed closing when these recommendations are made and not just to the Department of Defense. 
   In 1997, the Congress mandated there be a report on base closures. Secretary Cohen, in compliance with that, issued a report in April of 1998. That report, which we insisted on, contains a convincing analysis of 1,800 pages of detailed backup material. It is responsive to those who said last year that we needed a thorough analysis before we could reach a decision on the need for more base closures. 
   What that report reaffirms is that the Department of Defense simply has more bases than it needs. Since 1989, we have reduced the total active duty military end strength by one-third, but even after four base-closure rounds, DOD's base structure in the United States has been reduced by only 21 percent. We have a disconnect. We have too much structure. There are too many bases and facilities which are operating which we can no longer afford to operate and which must be consolidated. 
   Each of us in States that have faced those closures understand the short-term pain involved. We have lost all of our Strategic Air Command bases in Michigan. We understand what is needed in the aftermath to cushion the impact of those so-called realignments, which were closures, of our three SAC bases, but we succeeded. We are on our way back in all three areas. 
   The Department of Defense is telling us they have 23-percent excess capacity in current base structure. It seems to me we cannot hold our heads up and talk about the need of additional resources for the Department of Defense if we are not willing to close or at least put a process in motion which would fairly recommend the closure of some of this 23-percent excess capacity which the Department of Defense analysis says we have. 
   Mr. President, in relation to the excess capacity we have in our defense structure, the Department of Defense analysis concludes that we have 23 percent excess capacity in its current base structure. Just a few examples now of that excess capacity which I think are indefensible, again, particularly for those who are urging additional resources in the defense budget. 
   How do we justify the Army having reduced classroom training personnel by 43 percent while classroom space is only reduced by 7 percent? What we are doing by not allowing additional rounds of BRAC is telling the Army: You have to maintain all that classroom space even though you have no personnel to run it. So the classroom training personnel is reduced 43 percent; classroom space is only 7 percent reduced. 
   The Navy will have 33 percent more hangars for aircraft than it requires. We are telling the Navy--unless we allow these additional rounds of BRAC--you have to maintain those extra hangars even though you do not have the aircraft or the need for it. 
   The Air Force has reduced the number of fighters and other aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, while the base structure for those aircraft is 35 percent smaller. So they have to keep 18 percent more base structure than they need because we have been unable to show the political will to allow the military to do what they are pleading with us to allow them to do. 
   The chiefs come over here, the Secretary of Defense comes over here, year after year, and they say: We need additional rounds of base closures. So far, for the last few years at least, since the last round, we have been unwilling to show that political will to make those savings possible. 
   The report of Secretary Cohen has demonstrated some significant savings. People say: What about the savings? Can you really demonstrate savings? First of all, it seems to me, there is a commonsense demonstration that if you have four stores and you are making a profit in three, you are going to close one of those stores. 
   So many of us always tell the Defense Department they ought to emulate the private sector more, to act a little bit more as a business, be a little bit more businesslike, to show some savings in order to make it possible for us to fund some other things needed in the defense budget. 
   The Department of Defense estimates--these are not ours, these are the Department of Defense estimates--that BRAC, so far, has saved us $14.5 billion net. After 2001, when all of the four BRAC actions must be completed, what we call steady state savings, the savings will be $5.7 billion per year. Those are not our estimates; those are the Department of Defense estimates: $5.7 billion every year saved, starting after 2001, as a result of the four rounds we have had so far. 
   The CBO and the GAO reviewed the Department of Defense report. So our Budget Office and our General Accounting Office reviewed that report, and they agreed that base closure saves substantial amounts of money. 
   Based on the savings from the first four BRAC rounds, every year that we delay another base closure round, we deny the Defense Department, the taxpayers, and our Nation's defense about $1.5 billion in annual savings we can never recoup. 
   Again, I know base closings can be painful. I know that probably as well as anybody because all three SAC bases, as I said, in my home State have been closed, and we are still working hard to overcome the economic blow to those communities. 
   But we are working successfully. There is no question that the BRAC process is the fairest, most open, most objective way to close bases. Without it, we are not going to close bases. That is what history has shown. 
   Furthermore, in last year's bill we took steps to make the conveyance of BRAC property even easier for local communities. We have taken care of the objectionable part which surfaced last time when there was privatization in place which many thought had not been provided for by the Base Closure Commission but which the administration nonetheless allowed. We have cured that in this bill by saying the next Base Closure Commission must specifically authorize privatization in place for a closed facility or else it cannot occur. 
   Our forces need quality training. They need precision weapons. They do not need extra military bases. We just simply have higher priorities for our defense dollars than funding bases we no longer need. 
   As the Senator from Arizona said, we have paid a lot of attention, and should pay a lot of attention, to the chiefs' unfunded requirement lists. We should give, and do give, great weight to them. The Senator from Arizona listed the shortfalls the chiefs listed, totaling approximately $20 billion.  
   There are a number of ways to fund those unfunded requirements. One is to use some of the surplus we have worked so hard to achieve by just simply adding to the budget for the Defense Department, to the so-called top line. But we are not limited to that approach, and it is a difficult approach. 
   Whether or not we pay down the national debt, whether or not we protect Medicare, whether or not we have a tax cut, or whether or not we spend some of that on education, there are very important competing interests for the surplus. 
   We don't have to simply say: We will use the surplus and add money to the defense budget. We can find savings and reapply those savings to higher priorities. That is what past BRAC rounds are already doing for us, and that is what the BRAC rounds in this amendment will do for us in the future, if we are willing to do what the Secretary is asking us to do, not for himself but for his successors and, more importantly, for the men and women who will be serving under his successors. 
   Secretary Cohen said recently that his biggest disappointment as Secretary has been that the Department of Defense still has too much overhead and he has not been able to persuade his former colleagues, meaning us, to do what needs to be done to have more base closures. We all know Secretary Cohen. He was a colleague of most of us. I think every one of us trusted his judgment. We all know that BRAC affected him and his State when he served in this body, so this is not a request Secretary Cohen makes lightly. He knows what he is talking about and what he is asking of us. 
   We can't have it both ways. We can't say we want additional billions for health care, which we said today with the Warner amendment. We can't say we want additional billions for disability compensation, which was provided for in Senator REID's amendment. We can't talk about an additional pay raise for the military and all the other things we rightfully talk about and are concerned about and at the same time we maintain in place unneeded bases and structure. It is inconsistent. We can't have it both ways. It is an issue of political will and overcoming back-home concerns, understandable concerns but nonetheless overcoming those concerns to meet our long-term security needs. 
   Are we willing to do the necessary thing, the right thing to avoid the wasteful spending which is inherent when we maintain base structure we don't need, when we have reduced the size of our force by a third but our base structure by only 20 percent, and when we have classrooms and hangars that are no longer needed, a hundred other things that are no longer needed, because we don't have the political will to put in place an outside base-closing commission whose recommendations can be totally rejected if they are unfair by either the President or by us? That is a reasonable amount of political will for which to ask in order to achieve the billions of dollars of savings that will be achieved by additional rounds of base closings. 
   I yield the floor and thank the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 to the floor. The bill is the product of several months of bipartisan work on the part of our committee. I am, indeed, pleased to join with him in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   This year the President added $12 billion in defense spending to last year's appropriated levels. The congressional budget resolution added an additional $4.5 billion. For the most part, the committee chose to spend the money wisely. More than three-quarters of the money added by the budget resolution would be used to meet needs that are identified as priorities by the Joint Chiefs, or to accelerate items that are included in the future years' defense plan. 
   I may not agree with every provision in the bill--I do not--but S. 2549 overall is a sound bill that basically continues the bipartisan partnership between the Congress and the administration. This bill would build on the budget that was presented by the Department of Defense to improve the quality of life for the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families, and to transform our military to ensure they are capable of meeting the threats to American security in the 21st century. 
   I am particularly pleased the bill would implement the administration's proposal to address shortcomings in the health care we provide for our military personnel and retirees. Indeed, the bill would go a step further than the administration proposed and provide a prescription drug benefit for military 
   retirees. 
   I am appalled, and I hope most of us are appalled, by the rising cost of pharmaceuticals in this country and by the growing gap between the prices paid for drugs by our citizens and people who live in other countries. We have taken an important first step in this bill in agreeing to address the problem for military retirees. But it is my hope, perhaps during the course of this bill, and surely before the end of this Congress, we will be able to provide a similar benefit for Medicare beneficiaries whether they are military retirees or otherwise. All of our seniors--all of our seniors--should have an opportunity to purchase prescription drugs and not be precluded by an inability to pay the outrageous costs which prescription drugs now present to too many of our seniors. 
   The committee also made the right decision in supporting the Army transformation plan that was put forward by Secretary of the Army Caldera, and Army Chief of Staff General Shinseki. The committee concluded the Army needs to transform itself into a lighter, more lethal, survivable and tactically mobile force, and we approved all the funds that were requested by the Army for that purpose. In fact, we even added some research money that the Army said would help the long-term transformation process. 
   At the same time, we have instructed the Army to prepare a detailed roadmap for the transformation initiative, and to conduct appropriate testing and experimentation to ensure the transformation effort is successful. 
   The Department has made a strong commitment to the Joint Strike Fighter Program and the committee supports that effort. While our bill recognizes that slippage in the test schedule is virtually certain to result in a delay of the next milestone decision, we remain open to reprogramming of funds to enable the Department to make that decision in the year 2001, if it proves possible to meet a tighter schedule. 
   I am also pleased the bill reported by the Armed Services Committee provides full funding for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the three ongoing Department of Energy cooperative programs with Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. These programs serve as one of the cornerstones of our relationship with Russia and play an important role in our national security by reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from Russia or from rogue nations with which Russia may otherwise be tempted to form closer ties in the absence of these programs. 
   While some restrictive language has been included in the bill, I am hopeful this language will not undermine the effectiveness of the programs. I am disappointed the committee chose not to provide $100 million for a new, long-term Russian nonproliferation program at the Department of Energy. 
   This program would allow the Department of Energy to accelerate the closure of portions of Russian nuclear weapons complexes and secure additional nuclear materials. I am hopeful, with the help of other Senators, we can address this issue in the course of our debate on the Senate floor or perhaps in conference.

   Mr. LEVIN. This amendment was presented to us this morning. I think we should make an effort to see if we can't bring this amendment somehow or other into compliance with the Budget Act so we can accomplish the important provisions that are in this amendment. This is a goal which has been sought on a bipartisan basis to try to improve the provision of health care services to our retirees. 
   I think it is in all of our interests to see if we can't find a way that we can make this come into compliance with the Budget Act. I am particularly sensitive to the Budget Act's provisions. I am not sure Senator DOMENICI is with us today. I 
   believe he was absent during the picture, for reasons with which we are familiar. In that case, I am wondering whether or not, because of the Budget Act implications of this amendment, the Senator might be willing to set this aside so we can determine if there are ways of achieving these important goals consistent with the Budget Act.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Arizona for his tremendous sensitivity to the issue that he raises. We still have service members who are receiving food stamps and that should not be the case.  
   If there is good news here--and there is--it is that, since 1991, the number of service members on food stamps has been dramatically reduced, as well as the percentage in the total force has gone down dramatically since 1991. In 1991, there were 19,400 service members receiving food stamps. That number went to 11,900 in 1995, and then in 1999 it went to 6,300. That number--which is the latest we have--does not include the fiscal year 1999 or a later pay raise. So we have at least some good news in this area, which is that the number of service personnel on food stamps has been reduced by about two-thirds since 1991. 
   As a percentage of our total force, the percentage has been cut roughly in half, from .9 percent in 1991 to .45 percent in 1999. So there has been significant improvement. Senator MCCAIN is absolutely right. We still have 6,300 service members on food stamps. 
   We should not be in that situation. He is pointing out to this body again that we should try to do something about it. The informal estimate we get is that his amendment will help. It will not eliminate the number of people who we have on food stamps, but it will reduce by somewhat that number of 6,300. I am going to support it on that basis. 
   Again, I commend the Senator from Arizona for his constant raising of this issue until we can try to finally resolve this problem. 
   There is one little wrinkle in here which is sort of an irony, I guess. Maybe that is the best it is. For instance, if you take a typical E4 with three dependents who lives on base in Government housing, he will get the food stamps because he doesn't have a housing allowance. The person under this proposal who might be a similar E4 with the same number of dependents gets a housing allowance if he lives off base, and it is that housing allowance which pushes him above the eligibility level for food stamps. Yet, because that housing allowance may be inadequate to pay for housing, he may actually be in greater need for the food stamps than the person who is on base. However, that is something we will just have to try to work with. We have to try to make this work the best we possibly can to reduce the number of further service members who are receiving food stamps. 
   Again, I thank Senator MCCAIN for his constancy, his commitment, his dedication, and his passion to this issue. He is right, as he so often is in terms of what this goal must be, which is to remove members in the services from receiving food stamps. They should not need food stamps. We ought to be able to pay them enough and give them enough of a housing allowance so there is no need for them to receive food stamps. 
   I commend him. I will be supporting this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that narrow point, this language was significantly amended in committee, if I may say so. It wasn't offered in that form. It was amended. This language here is not the issue. The issue is that the amendment of the Senator from Virginia says that this President and the next President cannot take an action until after a certain action is taken at the end of 2001. That was never discussed in committee. It is not part----

   Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Virginia would have to make a decision on this because it is his amendment. But my understanding is that the decision of the President to lower the force structure--what he negotiates is a totally different issue. We are not limiting what the President can negotiate in terms of a treaty which will then be submitted to the Senate. 
   We are talking about a force structure which has to be maintained, subject to being changed either by treaty when ratified becomes the law of the land, or by a subsequent law. 
   What this language does, as I understand it, and I think I partly agree with the Senator from Arizona, is that he could not lower the force structure until that Quadrennial Defense Review and Nuclear Posture Review are submitted. I think that is the way the amendment reads. 
   However, I think I agree with what the Senator from Virginia suggested before, which is if that Quadrennial Defense Review and Nuclear Posture Review is submitted before December of 2001, at that point this waiver could be exercised by a President.

   Mr. LEVIN. What is interesting to me is that there has been an argument from the Senator from Virginia and our good friend from Arizona that there should be a review; until there is a review, there should not be a reduction in our force from START I levels.

   Mr. LEVIN. There was a review in 1994--1994. In 1994, the START II level was deemed to be adequate by the chiefs. There was a nuclear posture review in 1994. 
   Then, in 1996, we come along and say you can't go to START II levels. You have to stay with START I levels, we said, by law--by law. 
   So we had this thoughtful Nuclear Posture Review that took place in 1994, but we won't let a Commander in Chief implement that Nuclear Posture Review, which was thoughtfully carried out and which supported the START II levels in 1994 because we came along a year and a half later and said you have to stick with the START I levels. 
   Now the chiefs are very much opposed to that requirement in law that restricts us to START I levels, the higher levels, and doesn't allow a Commander in Chief to go to the START II levels. They have written us, and they have testified. Here is General Shelton:  
   I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that mandates specific force structure levels.  
   General Shelton:  
   The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider options that will reduce the strategic forces to the levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review.  
   That was 1994. He went on:  
   The START I legislative restraint will need to be removed before we can pursue these options. Major costs will be incurred if we remain at START I levels.   
   So we required that they stick at START I levels, in 1996. And then some of us now are critical of the Commander in Chief for not going to a different force structure. We are saying: Well, that's the law. We passed the law. We require him to stay at the START I levels. And now some of us criticize him for trying to do something precipitously, without adequate study. 
   There was an adequate study. It was called a Nuclear Posture Review in 1994, which said the START II levels were adequate for the security of this country. We will not let him go to the START II levels. Then, as my good friend from Nebraska points out, in 1997 there was an additional review. I do not think any of us want to suggest the chiefs did not do a thoughtful review in 1997, saying we could safely go, in a START III agreement, to a lower level than START II. But we are stuck at START I. We are at START I levels. Now we are saying we will let the next President go to a lower level than START I, but not this, because we want it to be thoughtful, when we had a thoughtful review in 1994. We will not let them go on. We had a thoughtful review in 1997 to which we won't let him go. 
   Of course, it should be thoughtful. We have had two of them right in the RECORD, right before us, that we are saying, 
   in the Kerrey amendment, to which we ought to allow a Commander in Chief to go. We have the Chiefs saying they want the option to go to the START II levels. Unless we say the chiefs do not act thoughtfully--and I do not think anybody in this Chamber wants to take that position--then it seems to me we should allow a Commander in Chief to go to the thoughtful Posture Review level of 1994 and the thoughtful 1997 level. 
   So the first thing we need to do is interpret what this amendment means. I do not know if Senator WARNER agrees with this, but I think Senator KYL has suggested the way I phrased that interpretation was accurate. I would be asking a question, even though Senator KERREY has the floor, of Senator WARNER, whether he agrees with Senator KYL's interpretation of the Warner amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership in this matter. This is a relatively small contribution from the people, acting through its Congress. The private sector is funding 95 percent of this effort. This is really symbolic almost, but it is an important contribution. It symbolizes where the heart of this institution, this Congress, is, and reflects where the American people are because they would, I think, applaud what the good  Senator from Virginia is doing here tonight, and I am happy to join. I thank him. He points out many things that I won't amplify, given the hour, except to say it is surely the right day today, this 56th anniversary of D-Day. 
   When he talks about how the American people who participated in that effort are all being honored, surely first and foremost are our veterans, but all the American people who are behind them; it is such an important point for all of us to remember. 
   I remember as a kid the minute, little contribution we kids were making, going around the streets looking for wrappers that we could peel off the foil, put it together in a little ball of metal, and then, with all the little balls of metal, put together a tank or an airplane. But first and foremost, obviously, it is the veterans, those who didn't come back and those who did. 
   I thank the Senator from Virginia for doing this. I don't know if he listed all the cosponsors.

   This is a special tribute to those of our colleagues, including yourself, who were in World War II. I know you are going to list them. But as this honor roll of heroes is read by the Senator from Virginia, I think we are all going to stand very proud that we have so many Members still in this body who served in World War II and, of course, many who did serve in this body who served in World War II who are also being honored. Senator Dole, of course, is very much in the lead in this effort, but so many others came before us who are currently in this body who served.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate began consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a reauthorization bill that would determine our national education policy. We spent a few days on that bill, offering and debating amendments, to reduce class size and reward teachers who improve student achievement, among other things. 
   On May 9, 2000, the Majority Leader withdrew the education bill from consideration, and the Senate moved on to other business. At the time, the Majority Leader indicated his intent to come back to the education bill, either later in that same week, or the week after. 
   It is now more than three weeks later and Congress is preparing to adjourn for the Memorial Day recess without addressing a critical component of our national education policy: school safety. 
   The education bill was likely withdrawn from the Senate because of the possibility of a school safety amendment aimed at curbing gun violence. Unfortunately, education and gun violence are now inseparable issues. The wave of school shootings--in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Littleton, Colorado, and recently, in Mt. Morris Township, Michigan--has changed America's perception of safety in school. 
   Over the last few years, we have made some gains. Over the four year period, from 1993 to 1997, the percentage of high school students who carried a weapon to school declined from 12% to 9%; the rate of crime against students ages 12 to 18 fell one-third; and 90 percent of schools reported no incidents of serious violent crime in 1996-1997. 
   Despite these gains, students feel less safe at school, and access to guns is a primary reason why. School violence, or even the threat of school violence, instills fear in our students, and limits their ability to learn. School violence also threatens and intimidates teachers--making instruction more difficult. 
   The learning environment is in jeopardy, and unless we address the vulnerabilities of our schools, many of our other efforts to improve the education system will be undermined. 
   I'm sure all of us agree that any act of violence--whether it's as common as a fist fight in the locker room or as extreme as a shoot out in the cafeteria--interferes with the educational process. Ron Astor, an assistant professor of social work and education at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has said: ``Violence in schools ..... interferes with children's physical well being, academic functioning, social relations, and emotional and cognitive development.'' 
   School violence has always posed a threat to students and teachers, but the advent of gun violence in schools has escalated the problem. Gun violence, not only affects students at a particular school, it has a rippling effect on students at schools in the same county, state, and in some cases, the entire country. 
   I have a letter from Professor Astor, who wrote to me earlier this month, when the Senate was debating education policy. Professor Astor has been researching the topic of school violence for over 17 years, and has produced 23 publications on the topic. His research gives us a clear understanding of how gun violence, and the fear of gun violence, impacts schools in Michigan, and in the 
    United States. 
   Professor Astor writes:  
   Dear Senator LEVIN, 
   I am pleased that the Senate is debating the topic of education in our nation. As a professor of education, I hope that you will include in your discussions the issue of school safety. As you know, the general public is seriously concerned with the safety of our schools. Polls taken over the past seven years indicated that the public considers school violence to be the top problem facing U.S. schools. Hopefully, the Senate's efforts will result in policy and legislation that make our schools safer for our children.  
   He continues:  
   Clearly, teachers, students, and school staff are most concerned about the presence of firearms and weapons in our schools. In the context of a discussion on guns and mass shootings, consider the fear described by this middle school teacher who participated in one of our studies: ``A lot of us are afraid. You come in the morning and you're just afraid to even go to work. You're just so stressed out, because you're all tensed up, you can't feel happy and teach like you want to because you've got to spend all of your time trying to discipline. You're scared somebody's going to walk in. We keep our doors locked. We have to keep our doors locked.'' Middle school teacher. (Meyer, Astor & Behre, 2000).  
   Professor Astor goes on:  
   In our studies, students and school staff often mention fear from the threat of guns and other lethal weapons. Without a doubt, the knowledge or rumor of a gun in a school instills fear in the school community. Teachers and students are well aware that the shocking mass murders recently perpetrated in schools are exclusively associated with firearms. Our country has a long history of lethal acts in schools (see Kachur et al, 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association), however, the use of guns as a weapon of choice, has made multiple murders a more common occurrence. This, in turn, has promoted a high level of fear within schools. Obviously, the fear of death or potential catastrophe is not conducive with a positive learning environment. Consequently, I urge you and your colleagues to take a strong stance on the issue of firearms.  
   Professor Astor quotes a middle school teacher frightened by the thought of a school shooting, and she is not alone. Teachers and students across this nation fear what may happen to them in the classroom. Those of us who feel strongly about education and school safety must do something to ease their fears. Congress must curb young people's access to guns. We must pass legislation designed to reduce the level of gun violence, and the fear of such violence, in our communities. 
   Gun violence is certainly not the only cause of fear in school. Professor Astor explains, that in addition to concerns about firearms, teachers and students fear more common forms of violence, such as fist fights, sexual harassment, teasing and bullying. All violence in school is unacceptable and we should continue to work toward curbing any and all student harm. But gun  violence is a dominant cause of fear among teachers and students in our schools 
   We have the opportunity to take the first step toward establishing a safer and more secure school environment, by among other things, passing the juvenile justice bill which would ban juvenile possession of assault weapons and close the gun show loophole. But if we can not pass the juvenile justice bill, we will use other means to prevent the gun violence that has plagued too many American schools and communities. 
   I hope this Senate will continue its debate on this country's long-term education needs and at the same time, work toward finding a long-term solution for reducing the shootings in American schools. Students around the country may be off for the summer, but Congress will have to keep working until we can make the grade on school safety. 
   I ask unanimous consent to submit the full text of Professor Astor's letter in the RECORD.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, USN, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Admiral Hutson will retire from the Navy on August 1, 2000, having completed a distinguished 27-year career of service to our Nation. 
   Admiral Hutson was born in North Muskegon, Michigan, and is a graduate of Michigan State University and the University of Minnesota Law School. He also earned a Master of Laws degree in labor law from Georgetown University Law Center. 
   During his military career, Admiral Hutson excelled at all facets of his chosen professions of law and naval service. He served as a trial and defense counsel at the Law Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, faithfully preserving military justice at its very foundations. As a staff judge advocate, he provided legal counsel to Commanding Officers at Naval Air Station, Point Mugu, California, and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine. He served as an instructor and later as the Commanding Officer of Naval Justice School, Newport, Rhode Island, playing a critical role in preparing and mentoring future generations of judge advocates. 
   As the Executive Officer of the Naval Legal Service Office, Newport, Rhode Island, and later the Commanding Officer, Naval Legal Service Office, Europe and Southwest Asia, Naples, Italy, Admiral Hutson proved to be an inspiring leader. He guided young judge advocates in the understanding, appreciation and dedication of their roles as both judge advocates and naval officers, exemplifying the Navy's core values of honor, courage, and commitment.  
   During his career Admiral Hutson also provided counsel and support to senior leaders while serving as the Staff Judge Advocate and Executive Assistant to the Commander, Naval Investigative Command and as Executive Assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. 
   I am sure many of my colleagues remember and appreciate Admiral Hutson's service as a legislative counsel and later as the Director of Legislation in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. During these assignments, he directly contributed to clear and thorough communication with Congress on the interests of the Navy in a broad range of legislative matters. 
   Admiral Hutson's dedication to service and superior performance in all assignments appropriately culminated in his appointment as the 36th Judge Advocate General of the Navy. In this role, he provided invaluable legal service to both the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He fulfilled these duties with great distinction, leaving the Judge Advocate General's Corps strong and well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. 
   It is fitting that following his retirement Admiral Hutson will become the Dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire, where he will continue to lead and mentor future servants of the law. 
   Mr. President, the Nation, the United States Navy, and the Judge Advocate General's Corps have been made better through the talent and dedication of Rear Admiral John D. Hutson. I know all of my colleagues join me in wishing him and his wife, Paula, fair winds and following seas.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be voting today against the nomination of Mr. Bradley Smith to serve as a Commissioner of the Federal Election Commission. It is with a fair amount of reluctance that I take this position, given the longstanding custom of allowing each party to appoint its own choices to this six member commission and the fact that FEC nominees are, by statute, supposed to be the representatives of their political parties on that commission. I respect that history. 
   I also believe Mr. Smith is a man of intelligence, integrity, and competence. So, my vote against his nomination is not a vote against him as a person. Nor will I vote against him because I disagree strongly with most of Mr. Smith's opinions on the campaign  finance system. He favors no contribution limits; I think they are essential. He doesn't see a link between corruption or the appearance of corruption and the contributions made to candidates and holders of public office; I do. He thinks the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Federal Election Commission should be dismantled; I don't. 
   The reason I will vote ``no'' is because I cannot support the nomination of an individual to the position of commissioner of an agency which the nominee doesn't think should exist or which has as its operating statute one which the nominee thinks should be repealed. I do not relish voting against this nominee to the FEC offered by the Republican leadership but Mr. Smith's opposition to the existence of the institution to which he is being nominated compels me to vote against him.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed the two nominees for the Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, Judge Marianne Battani and David Lawson. 
   Mr. President, Michigan could not be better served. These nominees are well-known in Michigan for their long and distinguished careers, high standards of moral and ethical conduct, and knowledge and commitment to the law. I have every confidence that they will both be outstanding federal judges. 
   While I am glad that the Senate has finally confirmed these two district court judges, I am deeply concerned about the vacancies in the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The length of time that nominees for these positions have remained pending is unfair, both to the nominees, and to the State of Michigan. 
   There are now three Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. One of the nominees for these vacancies is Helene White, who was nominated more than three years ago, and is still awaiting a hearing. Kathleen McCree Lewis has been pending at the Committee awaiting a hearing for more than eight months. And the third candidate for a Michigan seat has not yet been nominated but hopefully will be at any time. 
   These Michigan candidates are intelligent and hardworking advocates of the law, who at a minimum, deserve to have and up or down vote on their nominations. Yet, Circuit Court of Appeals nominees continue to face unconscionable delays in this Senate. 
   The Senate slowdown has a serious impact on the administration of justice. In a March 20, 2000 letter to Senator HATCH, Judge Gilbert Merritt, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, notes that these vacancies have hampered the Court's ability to complete the public's business. The Court, in his words, is deteriorating rapidly due to the high number of judicial vacancies. 
   Judge Merritt writes:  
   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies. Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many years of judge time because of the vacancies. 
   By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to take a vote on any of them. 
   Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The public's business should not be treated this way. The litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant. Each active judge of our Court is now participating in deciding more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is excessive by any standard. In addition, we have almost 200 death penalty cases that will be facing us before the end of next year. I presently have six pending before me right now and many more in the pipeline. Although the death cases are very time consuming (the records often run to 5000 pages), we are under very short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting on these cases. Under present circumstances, we will be unable to meet these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we have no discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case. 
   The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate ``advise'' as to judicial nominations, i.e., consider, debate and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, understaffed and unable properly to carry out their responsibilities for each year.  
   I again urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to promptly hold a confirmation hearing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals nominees from Michigan. They are highly qualified individuals who deserve to be voted on by this Senate.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will close a loop hole in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for employees of the Copper Range Company, formerly the White Pine Company, a copper mine in White Pine, Michigan. My legislation will extend TAA benefits to those employees who were responsible for performing the environmental remediation that was required to close the facility. 
   My legislation is needed because these employees were unfairly excluded from the TAA certification that applied to other workers at the facility simply because the service they provide, environmental remediation, does not technically support the production of the article that the mine produced: copper. My legislation simply extends TAA coverage to those few workers  who remained at the facility with responsibility for the environmental remediation necessary to close the facility. 
   The Copper Range Company received NAFTA-TAA certification in 1995 when it began closing down. The company was still in the process of closing down in 1997 and received re-certification at that time. As of the end of 1999, there were still workers at the plant engaged in the final stages of closing down. Their work consisted of environmental remediation. When the plant applied for re-certification in September for purposes of covering these workers, the Department of Labor (DoL) denied the request because DoL said that the remaining workers were not performing a job ending because of transplant to another NAFTA country; they were performing environmental remediation, not production of copper. 
   Mr. President, this is an unfair catch-22 situation that must be rectified legislatively. The legislation I am introducing today would provide those few employees involved in the final stages of closing down the mine with the same TAA benefits their co-workers received. The total number of workers at issue is small and my legislative fix is straightforward. I hope this legislation can be adopted quickly so that these Michigan workers who have fallen through the cracks can access the TAA benefits they rightfully deserve.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also yield myself 30 seconds to thank my good friend from Ohio for a very thoughtful statement. He has put his finger on the heart of the matter, which is that Congress, by acting now, putting on automatic pilot a withdrawal of forces a year from now, unless action is taken later on, creates a very dangerous year of uncertainty which threatens the success of this mission as well as our alliance. 
   It was an extremely thoughtful statement, which I hope all of our colleagues had an opportunity to hear. I thank the Senator.

His experience, both in war and in peace, has been invaluable and his contribution this morning is very clear. I thank him for that.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator HAGEL for a statement which is very meaningful because of the broad picture he drew, and also the interrelationship between what we are voting on and the whole host of other issues that are connected to it and impacted by it, as well as for the life experience and the life study he has brought to these questions. 
   In response to the good Senator from Virginia, I can only say what was voted on in the House yesterday is dramatically different from what we will be voting on. In addition to the funds that he made reference to that we have spent to avoid a wider war, even greater expenditures of funds have been well spent, in my judgment. And, indeed, the good chairman of our committee has been very supportive of those efforts. 
   We should not pull back from the success which has been achieved because the American people have made a commitment to stability in the Balkans to avoid a much broader problem in Europe and around the world.

   Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I happen to agree with the Senator and fought very hard with him to get the Europeans to do more. We have succeeded. They are not up to 85 percent of the combat forces, which is exactly what we wanted them to do. They are coming across with more police because of the pressure we put on them. Senator WARNER, I, and others put pressure on the Europeans to do more to carry through with their commitments. I think that pressure is useful. 
   The language before the Senate has two parts. The first part says if they don't meet specified targets in a certain date, we are out of there--unless, of course, Congress decides to change its mind. What we are putting in place on automatic pilot, we are out of there unless certain, specific, commitments can be kept. 
   The head of the Office of Management and Budget, by the way, has gone through the items and has said those specific items at this moment can't be certified, at least three out of four, for some very technical reason. 
   But there is a second part to this. Even if the Europeans do all that is required by this amendment in the first half of it --or in half of it--we are pulling out anyway. The second part of the amendment says unless Congress changes its mind by next July, we are pulling our forces out of there. 
   This is a totally inconsistent message in the language before us. Half the message is: You have to do certain things by certain dates, Europeans. The second half of the message is: Even if you do that, we are out of there. We need a plan, and unless the President requests and Congress authorizes, our troops are out of there. Those are inconsistent directions. It seems to me wrong for many reasons which have been outlined. 
   I notice the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from West Virginia are on the floor. I do not know if the Senator from Connecticut is ready, and I do not know if the Senator from West Virginia is ready. But I inquire, perhaps of both of them, if I could, whether or not they both wish to proceed at this time. Could I ask the Senator from West Virginia?

   Mr. LEVIN. My guess is, and I could be wrong on this, that happened on two recent occasions at least. We properly, in my judgment, said troops must be out of Somalia by a certain date; troops must be out of Haiti by a certain date, period. We approved that and I supported that. This language is very different from that. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-levin-mi-33-20000518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. This language says that we are deciding now that next year the troops must leave, unless--unless--later on Congress changes its mind. It is on automatic pilot. If the President does not request in a year, and unless the Congress authorizes in a year--in other words if the Congress does nothing, if the Congress does not change its mind--we are saying now that the troops are out of there in a year. That creates a year of very dangerous uncertainty, according to our recent commander, according to the head of NATO, according to the Secretary of Defense. It is that year of dangerous uncertainty which is being created here. 
   This is not a question, if I may say on my time, of the power of Congress. I could not agree with the Senator from West Virginia more. We have the power to do what is being proposed. There is no doubt about it. We can set deadlines. We can set conditional deadlines. We can set deadlines which are going to take place unless something else happens. 
   The question here is the wisdom--the wisdom of doing what is being proposed here, of deciding now that troops are going to come out of Kosovo, that they must be withdrawn unless, a year from now, the Congress changes its mind and decides to authorize it following a request from the President. What that precipitates is a year of very dangerous uncertainty, of wavering commitment to an alliance, and this is what both 
   General Clark, the head of NATO, and our Secretary of Defense have outlined for us. 
   Again, the question is not the power of the Congress to do what is being suggested by my good friend from West Virginia. That is indisputable. If that were the issue--does Congress have the power to do this--this vote I hope would be 100-0, that we have the power to do this. The question is its wisdom. What is the impact of the uncertainty, the trumpet that is unclear and uncertain, when we have just been successful in Kosovo with NATO allies? We are now asking NATO allies to do more--and they are doing more; now up to 85 percent of the ground forces. The question is the wisdom then to put into place language which says unless Congress changes its mind a year from now we are out of this? 
   And if I can quote, since I am on my time, this is the main objective of the language. According to the sponsors' Dear Colleague letter, the provision has three main objectives. First, it terminates funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the President seeks and receives congressional authorization to keep troops in Kosovo. In other words, a year from now something happens automatically unless we reverse ourselves.

   Mr. LEVIN. The question is whether it is wise to do this when we have just been successful in Kosovo. In Somalia, we had determined to withdraw. The sponsors of this language suggest we are not exactly determining to withdraw; we are sort of planning to withdraw and we can change our mind. That was not the case in Somalia. In Somalia, we had decided--and I very strongly supported the decision--to withdraw. It was time to withdraw and we made that decision. It was the right one. It was wise in the circumstances. We decided to pull our forces out. 
   Here it seems to me that is the question: Do we want to pull our forces out now? To say now that a year from now our forces are out of there? It seems to me that is the question, not the power of Congress. 
   The constitutional question, if put to this body, I hope would have a 100-0 vote that we have the power to do what is being proposed. But on whether it is wise when we have just been successful--part of a coalition fighting together for the first time, putting pressure on our allies to do more; succeeding in that pressure, they responded with now up to 85 percent of the ground forces--in that same language to say we are planning now on getting out a year from now, that is the question. It is the wisdom of this language, not the power of Congress to pass it. 
   I thank my good friend from West Virginia and yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Byrd-Warner provision would make the decision that U.S. ground troops must pull out of Kosovo starting in August of this year if the Europeans don't meet certain specified percentages of their financial and civilian police commitment, unless the Congress changes its mind and decides otherwise. 
   It did decide, in any event, that even if the Europeans do meet their commitments, even if they do meet the commitments we have been urging them to meet--and they have been making progress--even if they meet those commitments, next year, in any event, our troops are coming out of Kosovo, unless Congress changes its mind. It is all self-executing. If Congress does nothing from this point on, if we adopt the Byrd-Warner language, next year, in the middle of the year, our troops must come out of Kosovo. 
   Now, the issue here isn't whether we have the power to set a withdrawal date and to enforce it with the power of the purse. That is not the issue. I think all of us would support the right of this Senate and this Congress to set a withdrawal date for our forces from anywhere. We have exercised that power. We exercised it in Somalia and in Haiti. The issue before us is the wisdom of setting a withdrawal date today, putting it on automatic pilot, and saying that a year from now, unless Congress reverses its position, those troops must come out. That creates a dangerous period of uncertainty, a destabilizing period of uncertainty, which we have been urged not to set in motion by our Secretary of Defense, by the Secretary General of NATO, and by the recent commander of our forces in Kosovo. 
   First, Secretary Cohen, on May 11, said:  
   I strongly believe the Kosovo language in the supplemental is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and will seriously jeopardize the relationship between the U.S. and our NATO allies.

   Mr. LEVIN. The Secretary General of NATO, on May 16, in a letter that has been referred to by Senator MCCAIN, said the following in a different paragraph--one that he didn't read, but which I think is also significant:  
   If this language is adopted, it would point toward a single policy outcome to the withdrawal of U.S. forces.  
   Then he went on to say:  
   As Secretary General, the prospect of any NATO ally deciding unilaterally not to take part in a NATO operation causes me deep concern. It risks sending a dangerous signal to the Yugoslav dictator Milosevic that NATO is divided and that its biggest and most important ally is pulling up stakes.  
   This is the Secretary General of the greatest alliance in world history--one that we have been a leader of--who is  saying the adoption of this language risks sending a dangerous signal to Milosevic that NATO is divided and that its biggest and most important ally is pulling up stakes. 
   General Clark, recently the commander of our forces in Kosovo, wrote the following:  
   These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pullout decision by the United States. They are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitments, and trust of our allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting, and instability in the Balkans.  
   So the issue here isn't our power. We have it. Everyone in this body will protect it--I hope. As long as I am here, I will be fighting for the same power Senator BYRD so eloquently talks about that the Congress must have--the power of the purse, the power to set a deadline, should we choose, such as the power we exercised in Somalia to set a deadline and to force our troops out. 
   We have, at times, exercised that power. At times, we have shown, in my judgment, the wisdom not to exercise that power. We have not exercised it in Iraq. We are not exercising it in Korea. We are not exercising it in Bosnia at this point. We have not authorized those engagements to continue. We have not determined that we are going to put an end to them. So we have exercised judgment both ways, in our wisdom. We have the power to put an end to our presence in Iraq, or in Bosnia, or in South Korea. We have the power, but we have decided, in our wisdom, not to exercise that power. 
   I hope that today, in our wisdom, for the reasons set forth by Mr. Cohen, General Clark, and the Secretary General of NATO, we will not create this period of dangerous uncertainty if we today decide that a year from now we are going to withdraw troops unless Congress changes its mind. It is the wrong message for our troops, for the reasons General Clark gives. It is a terrible message to our European allies because in one part of this amendment it says we want you to meet certain standards, but in the other part of the Byrd-Warner language it says even if the Europeans meet their standards and their commitments, nonetheless, unless Congress changes its mind in the next year, our troops are going to be withdrawn. It is on automatic pilot. It is self-effectuating. If no action is taken further by the Congress, our troops must be withdrawn.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership in this effort. 
   Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of mothers and others were in Washington, DC, for the Million Mom March, marching for sensible gun laws and safe kids. From my State of Michigan, thousands of moms came with  their children, with their husbands, and with their parents to demonstrate for sensible gun safety legislation. 
   Those moms are distraught. They have lost children in school shootings and in drive-by shootings. They have lost their kids in accidental shootings and in murders in their homes and in the streets. They are afraid to send their kids to school or to play at another child's house. There are teachers who are afraid to go to work. They all marched last weekend to put an end to that fear. My wife Barbara and I marched along with them. 
   Every day, 12 of our children, on average, are killed from gunfire in America. Mothers are disheartened both by the children lost and by the unwillingness of Congress to do anything about gun safety legislation. 
   Of the hundreds of mothers I met this weekend, not one of them said let's do away with guns in this country, and yet that is how NRA leaders label the actions of the million moms. In reality, Michigan mothers and mothers around the country are simply calling for sensible gun safety. 
   The moms I met do not want to endure what a Michigan mother, Veronica McQueen, endured. Her 6-year-old daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot by another 6-year-old at an elementary school not too far from Flint. On Sunday, she told her audience:  
   Part of my heart went with her. It is so hard for me to think that I will never see her smile, laugh, or play again; I can never hold her or kiss her again, or see her grow up, get married, and have a happy life.  
   The mothers who marched on Sunday know that in order to reduce the level of gun violence in this country, we must do many things. 
   One of the things we must do is to pass stricter laws to keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have guns--children who should not have guns, criminals who should not have guns. The way to do this, in the first instance, is to pass the juvenile justice bill with the Senate gun amendments. 
   About a year ago this week, the Senate passed an amendment which closed the gun show loophole by applying the Brady background checks to guns sold at gun shows. The gun show loophole allows criminals and other prohibited persons to buy guns at a gun show from a private person that they could not buy from a licensed dealer. 
   It is a loophole which has been exploited frequently by those who deliberately do not want to undergo background checks, including the Columbine gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
   On April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold opened fire on their classmates with four semiautomatic assault guns. Of those weapons, three were purchased by their friend, Robyn Anderson, at a gun show. Mr. President, 18-year-old Robyn Anderson bought her younger friends three weapons. Because she bought them at a gun show, she did not need to go through a background check. 
   Later she testified about this. I would think, of the various testimonies that come out of Columbine, this is some of the most memorable. This is what she said. This is the 18-year-old who bought the guns for the two killers. She said:  
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday...... While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check.  
   Robyn continues:  
   I was not asked any questions at all. There was no background check........Dylan got a shotgun. Eric got a shotgun and a black rifle that he bought clips for. He was able to buy clips and ammunition without me having to show any I.D. The sellers didn't write down any information.  
   And here is her bottom line:  
   I would not have bought a gun for Eric and Dylan if I had had to give any personal information or submit any kind of check at all. I think it was clear to the sellers that the guns were for Eric and Dylan. They were the ones asking all the questions and handling all the guns.  
   She concluded:  
   I wish a law requiring background checks had been in effect at the time. I don't know if Eric and Dylan would have been able to get guns from another source, but I would not have helped them. It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.  
   So the Columbine gunmen knew about the gun show loophole. They took full advantage of it. The result: 15 dead. Congress has a chance to close the loophole with the gun show amendment. But that amendment is part of a juvenile justice bill which is tied up because the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate will not allow a conference to meet. It is at that conference where Members are supposed to reconcile differences between the two bills. 
   The Brady law is not intrusive to law-abiding Americans. Mr. President, 72 percent of the checks are completed in 3 minutes, and 95 percent are cleared within 2 hours. The 5 percent of people whose background checks take more than 24 hours to complete are 20 times more likely to have a criminal record or otherwise be prohibited from buying firearms. It is just simply not unreasonable to extend the Brady background check to guns that are bought at gun shows. 
   Congress must act. The moms, the dads, the grandparents, the families want us to act. We must vote yes on the pending sense-of-the-Senate legislation that Senator DASCHLE and others have offered in order to clearly state to the American public that there are some of us here, yes, in the majority in the Senate--since the majority passed these amendments--the majority of us want to act. With their help--the million moms, and millions more like them--we will hopefully be able to move this legislation this year, reduce the number of killings, and save more families from the tragedies which have been too often witnessed in this country. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Our amendment strikes language in the bill which requires ground troops be withdrawn from Kosovo by a fixed date next year unless Congress later changes its mind. Our amendment would strike language requiring withdrawal this year, unless the President certifies that certain specific contribution targets have been met by the Europeans. 
   We are attempting to strike this language for the pullout of our ground forces next year for many reasons. First and foremost, in my judgment, is that such a requirement will create a year or a year and a half of dangerous uncertainty and dangerous instability in the Balkans. Creating that year of uncertainty and instability is dangerous because it is inconsistent with what we have struggled so hard to achieve in the Balkans, which is stability in a relatively peaceful environment. Creating that uncertainty for a year or a year and a half would make us an unreliable partner in NATO. 
   I hope when we come to vote on this matter, we will take into account the words of General Wesley Clark, who was our commander there until a few weeks ago. He wrote a letter. I want to quote very briefly from that letter because it seems to me this captures what our problems are with this language that is in the bill. General Clark wrote:  
   These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitment and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans. 
   At the time that US military and diplomatic personnel are pressing other nations to fulfill and expand their committment of forces, capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally mandated pull-out would undercut their leadership and all parallel diplomatic efforts.  
   He also wrote that these provisions will place U.S. forces on the ground at increased risk.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue is not whether Congress has the power to force withdrawal of ground forces. We have that power. We should have that power. We should defend that power. And we have exercised that power, recently in Haiti and Somalia before that. We have exercised that power to pull out ground forces when the power has contributed to U.S. security. So the issue is not whether we have the power to act in the way the Appropriations Committee proposes. The question is whether or not it is a wise exercise of congressional power to set a deadline for a pullout in Kosovo, thereby creating a year or two of dangerous uncertainty which would result in increased risks to our troops and to our interests. 
   It is not the power of Congress that is at issue; it is the wisdom of exercising that power in the way proposed under these circumstances which we will be debating today and tomorrow. 
   I ask that Senator COCHRAN of Mississippi be added as a cosponsor of our amendment, and I will now yield to my friend from Delaware for 45 minutes.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue before this body tomorrow--at least the principal issue--will be whether we are going to set a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Kosovo by the middle of next year. I will be coming back to that issue a little bit later in my remarks. But before we directly address that question, I would like to go back a bit in time and talk about how we got here and about NATO's air campaign. 
   That campaign was the correct response to Milosevic's brutal repression of the Kosovo population and was the correct response to Milosevic's effort to spread instability in the region. 
   Now that ethnic cleansing has been reversed, for the first time in the 20th century, NATO's peacekeeping mission was the right thing to do, to give the people of Kosovo a chance to live peaceful and productive lives. And NATO's peacekeeping mission is the right thing to continue, to give that chance to live a chance to flower. 
   We are at a crucial point with respect to Kosovo. Ten months into the NATO-led peacekeeping phase of the operation, there are some encouraging signs. There are not such encouraging signs, I am afraid, inside the Senate. 
   The first and most significant fact in Kosovo is that over one and a half million people have returned to their homes, homes from which they were driven, and they have returned either from abroad or from the woods. 
   Mass torture, rape, and looting were the substance of daily life in Kosovo just a year ago. There is still too much violence, but the contrast is stark. When the NATO-led Kosovo force, or KFOR, arrived in Kosovo in June of 1999, there was a weekly murder rate of about 50. It is now down to an average of five--still too high, but comparable to large cities in the developed world. 
   The discussion taking place within the international community is now how fast, how many, to where in Kosovo the Serbs and other minorities should return. There is still a long way to go in Kosovo before Kosovo is safe for all of its former residents, but progress is being made. 
   Dr. Bernard Kouchner, head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, had it right when he said that ``Kosovo is emerging from 40 years of communism, 10 years of apartheid, and a year of ethnic cleansing, and that it is simply unrealistic to expect that a Switzerland would be created there in less than a year.'' 
   Some who maintain that a deadline should be set now for the pull out of U.S. combat forces point to the fact that the United States flew over 70 percent of the missions in the air campaign. The argument is that it is now the Europeans' turn to bear the peacekeeping burden. Well, that is exactly what is happening. The European nations are providing over 80 percent of the peacekeeping troops for Kosovo, and the United States is providing about 15 percent of the troops. The Europeans have responsibility for four of the five peacekeeping sectors in Kosovo. The KFOR commander is presently a Spaniard. He was preceded by a Brit, and then preceded before that by a German. The Eurocorp, a multilateral command composed of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and Spain, took over the KFOR headquarters function last month. Last week, NATO announced that an Italian would become the KFOR commander in October. 
   Moreover, the European nations, either as part of the European Union, or individually, have pledged to provide more than 75 percent of the financial contributions to Kosovo. Now, that brings us to the provision that is included in the military construction appropriations bill. This provision makes the decision now that U.S. ground forces will pull out of Kosovo after July of next year. That is the heart of the matter. It is a decision in this bill now that those ground forces will pull out of Kosovo in the middle of next year. 
   If we leave this language in the bill, Congress will be deciding to pull our ground forces out next July. We will have an opportunity later to reverse that decision if we change our minds. But unless Congress changes its mind, the decision is made. Nothing more needs to be done. It is a self-effectuating decision. If Congress does nothing, those troops--we would be deciding now--must come out in the middle of next year. 
   In another part of the language, it says that if the Europeans do not meet specified percentages of their pledges for financial assistance and police contributions, the withdrawal of our forces would start in August of this year, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution providing otherwise. But if Congress does nothing, the decision is made now. This is not left to a later decision of Congress. We would be deciding now that those troops must come out, if the Europeans do not meet very specified percentages of certain pledges for financial assistance. 
   I have been one that has criticized the Europeans for not delivering on those financial pledges--particularly for not providing more civilian police for Kosovo. I have joined our chairman, Senator WARNER, in criticizing the Europeans very publicly, very openly. We have talked to the foreign and defense ministers from Britain, France, and Germany, as well as the Ambassador of the European Union to the United States. I have publicly said it is a little more than hypocritical for the 
   European Union to talk about grand plans for European security and defense identity at the same time they are not appropriately living up to their pledges of financial assistance and civilian police for Kosovo. 
   So I believe that we should be continuing to put pressure on the Europeans to live up to our commitments, and I think we ought to live up to our own commitments as well. I have a number of concerns with the Byrd-Warner language relative to the Europeans' commitments. 
   First, I don't agree with the consequences that would follow if the President is unable to certify that the Europeans are meeting their precise commitment; namely, in the absence of a majority vote of both Houses of Congress, our ground forces would automatically have to withdraw from a NATO-led peacekeeping operation. I don't object to voting on that issue, but I strongly believe that the proper way to use the power of the purse is to vote directly on whether or not to cut off funding. That is what we did in Somalia in 1993 with the Byrd amendment, and in 1994 with the Defense appropriations bill, with that amendment. But that is very different from what is being proposed now, which is to require a withdrawal of U.S. forces later, unless a later vote authorizes the peacekeeping operation, or unless specific targets are met by the Europeans. 
   Throughout our history, while we have used the power of the purse to cut off funding for the deployment of our forces, Congress has not, to my knowledge, enacted legislation that would require the Congress to affirmatively vote at a later date to allow a deployment to continue. The provision before us basically says if Congress doesn't act in a specific way at a later date, our forces must withdraw from Kosovo, so that the fate of Kosovo may very well be determined by the impetus of Congress to act. 
   The power of the purse is a vital power. It is totally appropriate to seek to exercise that power. But the power, as wielded here, sets up a process by which nonaction by the Congress would lead to the withdrawal of our forces from Kosovo. The Byrd-Warner provision decides now to require the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Kosovo next July, unless Congress changes its mind in the interim. The issue then isn't whether Congress has the power to set deadlines. Of course we have the power. If that were the issue before us, the vote on this would be 100-0 to maintain that power. The issue before us is whether we want to force the withdrawal of ground forces from Kosovo in July of 2001. That would be an unwise exercise of a power that Congress clearly had. 
   So the language before us isn't about a theoretical principle that Congress has the power to set deadlines. The  Byrd-Warner language exercises that power. No further action is needed later, and unless further action is taken later, our ground forces would be withdrawn next July.

   Mr. LEVIN. If I may finish this one thought, I will be happy to yield. That is what it comes down to. The proponents do not want us participating--by their own words--in NATO-led ground forces, even at a junior partner level of 10 or 15 percent because, in the words of the proponents in a Dear Colleague letter they sent, ``The Europeans should be responsible for the ground element of the Kosovo peacekeeping mission.'' That is what the proponents wrote to all of us. They don't want 
   us participating. They want us out of there. Unless we change our mind, we will be out of there because, in their words, ``The Europeans should be responsible for the ground element of the Kosovo peacekeeping mission.'' 
   By the way, I reiterate, we are supplying 15 percent of the forces. We have pleaded with the Europeans for years to become more active in their own defense, and they have now responded. They are now the senior partner, with 80 percent of the ground forces. We are 15 percent, and the other non-Europeans are 5 percent. 
   We are the junior partner right now. But the language in this bill says we don't want to even perform that role. That is what will unravel this mission and endanger this mission in the eyes of NATO and its leaders. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. LEVIN. It is limited reassurance because it doesn't answer the heart of the problem, which is that if Congress does not vote later to authorize those troops, we are deciding now that those troops must leave. 
   General Clark told us the problem is that in the year between now and then you have tremendous uncertainty, to put it mildly, as to whether Congress will authorize those troops to 
   continue despite the commitment of one Senator to vote that way. It is that uncertainty which creates danger for our troops. Those aren't my words. Those are the words of General Clark's, who commanded those forces until a few weeks ago. That is the uncertainty which creates problems inside of our NATO alliance. That is the problem that creates in Milosevic the hope that he can restore himself to power for 1 year. For 1 year what is going to be the law of this land is that, unless Congress by majority vote decides to authorize those troops in Kosovo, the American forces must leave. 
   It is a dangerous uncertainty. It is a debilitating uncertainty in terms of NATO. It is an encouraging uncertainty in terms of Milosevic. And it is an uncertainty that we should not create. There would be a way to avoid this. There is a way that I suggested. 
   The way to avoid this is to guarantee the Senator from Virginia an opportunity that he could vote to pull the plug a year from now. That is a lot different. That is not this language. That was language which I suggested to my good friend from Virginia that we could guarantee a year from now that there would be an opportunity to force the withdrawal of those troops. That doesn't create the year of uncertainty which this language does because the language in this bill that my amendment would strike creates the uncertainty because if Congress does nothing a year from now, if the majority does not act a year from now to authorize these troops, the year of uncertainty between now and then will take a horrendous toll. Those are not my words. Those are the words of General Clark, the expert in the field. It seems to me that is a significant difference. 
   One other point, and I would be happy to yield further, but I probably want to do this on my good friend's time.

   Mr. LEVIN. In the middle of the air campaign, while our fliers were putting their lives at risk over Kosovo, the House of Representatives could not even muster a majority to support our air campaign. My good friend says he will be the one to trigger this vote in the Senate. I have no doubt that he would. Once he says something, he means it. I would bet my life on it. I have bet an awful lot on his words many times, and I have never lost a bet. 
   But I will say this: You can't tell us what the House of Representatives will do, or what 99 other Senators will do a year from now, and the problem, General Clark tells us, is that year of dangerous uncertainty is destabilizing, discourages our allies in NATO, encourages Milosevic, and is a real morale buster for our troops. It endangers our troops. It puts them at greater risk during this year. That is what General Clark told us in his letter, which I will read in a few moments. 
   I would be happy to yield.

   Mr. LEVIN. It could go up to, let's say, 10 months of uncertainty. That is a dangerous period of time, which is, by the way, not necessary to create. 
   If my friend wanted a guaranteed vote on whether or not to pull the plug on our forces next year, that can be arranged--a guaranteed vote. But that is not what this is. 
   Let's be very clear on this. This says that unless the majority decides a year from now to authorize something, that automatically then, on automatic pilot, self-effectuating, we are deciding now, and those troops must leave. And it is that dangerous period between now and then--whether it is 10 months, 12 months, or 14 months--it is that destabilizing dangerous period which the  NATO Secretary General and General Clark have told us endangers the mission and endangers our troops. 
   It is unheard of, I believe. There is no precedent that we can find for the Senate or the Congress ever deciding in year 1 that unless something is authorized in year 2, relative to a deployment of forces, that those forces must be withdrawn. We have pulled the plug on deployment. 
   I have voted to pull the plug on deployments. I have voted to end deployments in Haiti. I voted, after my dear friend from Virginia and I went to Somalia, both before and after, to set deadlines and pull our troops out of Somalia. 
   That is not what we are doing here. What we are doing is deciding now that if Congress doesn't authorize a deployment next year--be it May, June, or August--those troops must go. It creates between now and then a very dangerous period, and a period which is demoralizing for our troops, according to the former commander. That is what we ought to avoid. It is unnecessary for us to do that. 
   Some people ask, is there anything wrong with exercising the power of the purse? My answer is, I am going to defend the power of the purse. Senator BYRD is surely correct in saying we have the power to do what the Senator from Virginia and he proposed that we do. I don't doubt that. I doubt its wisdom--not the power of Congress, but whether it is wise for us to do what is being proposed. 
   When it comes to the constitutional power issue, if that were the issue before us, whether or not Congress has the power to do what the Senator proposed, if that were the question, I would say we have the power. I think we would have a 100-0 vote. I hope so in terms of the prerogative of this branch of Government. The question isn't power. It is wisdom. 
   Is this the right thing to do? 
   Do we want to create this year of uncertainty and instability? Do we want to put into place a self-effectuating, automatic process which would lead to the withdrawal of forces later unless something happens between now and then? I think the answer clearly is no.

   The question of Congressional prerogatives is an internal matter for the U.S. Congress and the administration to resolve. I'm in no position to comment. Where I do have a concern, however, is that in the way the legislation is written, it would not just affirm the Congressional privilege, but point toward a single policy outcome--the withdrawal of U.S. forces. 
   As Secretary General, the prospect of any NATO ally deciding unilaterally not to take part in a NATO operation causes me deep concern. It risks sending a dangerous signal to the Yugoslavian dictator, Milosevic--that NATO is divided, and that its biggest and most important ally is pulling up stakes.  
   That is how our NATO allies feel about this language. 
   Some have argued that Congress has never authorized or even formally debated U.S. involvement in Kosovo since the Senate on March 23, 1999, authorized airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, some have argued that the Congress has not authorized or debated United States involvement in Kosovo since the Senate, in March of 1999, authorized airstrikes against Yugoslavia. That is not correct. 
   On June 10, 1999, during the House of Representatives consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill, the House approved an amendment offered by Mr. Skelton that deleted language in the bill as reported out of committee that would have prohibited any funding for combat or peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia after September of 1999. The vote on the House floor was 270-155. 
   Additionally, on May 25, 1999, during the Senate's consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill, Senator SPECTER offered an amendment that would have prohibited the use of funds for the deployment of United States ground troops in Yugoslavia, except for peacekeeping personnel, unless authorized by a joint resolution authorizing the use of military force. 
   Senator SPECTER's amendment was tabled by a vote of 52-48. Proponents of this bill assert that Congress has a constitutional responsibility to address policy issues involving the deployment of U.S. troops overseas in instances in which American men and women are being sent into potentially dangerous situations. 
   But the language singles out the involvement in Kosovo. The language relates to Kosovo, not to a general principle. The United States has been enforcing a no-fly zone in Iraq for more than 9 years. U.S. and British aircraft are being fired upon by Iraqi forces almost daily. They respond by attacking Iraqi air defense and command and control installations. Our pilots are clearly at risk. Total incremental costs for our operations in the Persian Gulf are $1.2 billion a year. It is estimated that for this fiscal year it will be about $1 billion. 
   The United States has been contributing forces to NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Bosnia for 5 years. The U.S. contingent in that effort is 4,600 troops. With the passage of time, the risk to our troops in Bosnia is probably less than it is in Kosovo, but they are at risk. More than $9 billion has been appropriated since fiscal year 1991 for Bosnia-related operations. 
   We have 3,700 troops in South Korea. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in March of this year, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency said that war in the Korean peninsula could occur at any time. Our troops in South Korea are clearly at risk. It does not appear that our U.S. troop deployments in the Persian Gulf or Bosnia or Korea are going to end anytime soon. There is no fixed date for the end of these deployments. But they are important missions and our troops should remain deployed until those missions are completed. 
   Proponents suggest we are abdicating our responsibility by not specifically authorizing U.S. troops' participation in the NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Surely Congress is not abdicating its responsibility by not having expressly authorized deployments in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, and Korea as a condition of their continued deployment. So the issue before the Senate is not a principle or else that principle would presumably be consistently applied. 
   The issue before us is not the power of Congress. We have that power. Every one of us, I hope, would vote to defend that power. I will as long as I am in the Senate of the United States. If the issue is does Congress have the power of the purse to end the deployment, I will defend that principle. But I will not defend its application every time there is an attack on the deployment of our forces or an effort made to end the deployment of our forces. 
   The question here is, Is it wise now to say that a year from now, unless Congress votes affirmatively and changes its mind, that we are saying now that those forces must leave Kosovo? That is the question. It is the wisdom of the application of the power in these circumstances in this way that is the issue before the Senate. It is not the abstract power of the purse or the abstract power to force the pullout of American forces because there cannot be any doubt that we have that power constitutionally. The question is, Is it wise to exercise that power now in Kosovo in this way, with the resulting year of dangerous uncertainty, as General Clark has outlined to us--endangering the NATO effort in Kosovo, endangering the morale of our forces in Kosovo, emboldening 
   Milosevic to return to Kosovo? That is the question. Is it wise to exercise that power now to be effective a year from now unless we change our mind? That is the only issue, not the abstract power of the Senate. 
   I could give many other examples of where we have forces in different places. I have talked about the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, and South Korea. We have forces in the western Sahara; we have forces in Sinai; we have forces in East Timor. We have forces in a number of places around the world--and in many ways I think we are overstretched, by the way. We have forces in so many places, but I do not believe there has been any specific congressional authorization for the deployment of U.S. military personnel to any of those deployments. We could cut off funding for those deployments; we have that power. But a failure to specifically authorize them cannot represent an abdication or the loss of constitutional power over the purse. It cannot mean  that. We have not abdicated our power or abdicated the power of the purse by failing to authorize forces in East Timor or Sinai or in Bosnia or in South Korea or in Germany. We have decided as a Congress not to withdraw those forces. Any one of us at any time on any appropriations bill related to defense or on the defense authorization bill could offer an amendment saying we want those troops out of there. Then we would debate the wisdom of doing that. But the issue is the wisdom, not the power. 
   Finally, I hope General Clark's words and those of NATO General Secretary Robertson will be with us as we vote on this amendment. Just to pick one sentence from General Clark's letter to conclude, this language, if it stays in this bill:  
   ......would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the United States. Those measures are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitment and trust of our allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans.  
   That is what the year of uncertainty that this language, if left in this bill, will precipitate. I hope we will avoid that. I hope we will strike this language, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senators LIEBERMAN, DASCHLE, MCCAIN, FEINGOLD, and others today in sponsoring this legislation to close the Section 527 loophole in our campaign finance and tax laws. 
   Section 527 of the IRS Code was originally created by Congress in the 1970's to provide a category of tax exempt organizations for political parties and political committees. While contributions to a political party or political committee are not tax deductible to the contributor, Congress did provide a tax exemption to the political organization for the money contributed. At the time Congress established the tax exemption, it assumed that since the sole stated purpose of such organizations is to influence elections, the organizations would be filing a more complete disclosure with the FEC under the campaign finance laws and consequently it wasn't necessary to require disclosure with the IRS. Once a federal court ruled in 1996 that coverage under the federal election laws required advocating the election or defeat of a specific candidate and not just seeking to influence the outcome of an election, the backbone of disclosure for Section 527 political organizations dissolved. Section 527 organizations could get the tax exemption for a political organization without having to follow the requirements--both the disclosure requirements and the contribution limits--of the federal election laws. Thus, an organization can state openly to the IRS that it is spending money for the sole purpose of influencing an election and get a tax exemption under Section 527, yet it can avoid registering with the Federal Election Commission because it can argue that its influence is not directed at a specific candidate. That's the kind of Alice-in-Wonderland logic we've got with this loophole. 
   Today we are offering two alternative solutions to the Section 527 problem. One bill would apply filing requirements to Section 527 organizations that are required of other tax exemption organizations in the Tax Code and add new requirements to disclose contributions to the public; the other would require a Section 527 organization to comply with the federal election laws, as was originally contemplated when Congress created Section 527 in the first place. Given the limited number of legislative days remaining, we think it wise to pass, at a minimum, the bill requiring disclosure under tax code, although as a long-term solution, we favor the bill requiring disclosure and limits under the federal campaign laws. 
   Mr. President, the Section 527 loophole in our federal campaign laws is a bipartisan problem that requires and deserves a bipartisan solution. Supporters of both parties have Section 527 organizations. This is a loophole in our laws that you can drive not only a truck through, but a convoy of trucks. And that's what's happening as we speak. Individuals and organizations that want to affect our federal elections but don't want to be restricted by our federal election laws are making tracks to Section 527 and establishing Section 527 organizations to run their election ads--without disclosure, without contribution limits. 
   Now those ads--like other sham issue ads--can't say ``vote for'' or ``don't  elect'', but they can go right up to that line and make essentially the same point. 
   Mr. President, even if a Member of this body doesn't support campaign finance reform, he or she can support this legislation, because it is about disclosure and it eliminates an unintended consequence of the convergence of two laws--the tax laws and the campaign finance laws. Congress never intended to allow Section 527 organizations to escape both disclosure and campaign finance limits. Yet that's what's happened as a result of recent interpretations by the IRS and a U.S. District Judge. Our legislation reverses these interpretations and reinstates Congressional intent. 
   In late January of this year, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation released a study of the Disclosure Provisions Relating to Tax-Exempt Organizations. In that study, the bipartisan staff addressed Section 527 organizations and the JCT staff recommended: that 527 organizations be required to ``disclose information relating to their activities to the public .....''; and that 527 organizations ``be required to file an annual return even if the organizations do not have taxable income and that the annual return should be expanded to include more information regarding the activities of the organization.'' [Section 527 organizations currently aren't even required to file a tax return.] 
   The JCT report said, ``This recommendation is consistent with the recommendation that all tax returns relating to tax-exempt organizations should be disclosable.'' 
   As the 2000 campaign evolves and we get closer to November, the American public is going to be seeing the consequences--the real life consequences of this loophole in our campaign finance laws. Candidates from both parties are going to be hit with ads by groups with names that sound like responsible civic organizations but which in reality are nothing more than well financed political opponents. But the damage from such ads will be incurred well before a candidate can even catch his or her breath much the less make any headway in identifying the source of the money behind the ads. That's why we need this legislation now.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, S. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 Conference Report breaks important new ground in trade legislation. For the first time, in exchange for granting unilateral trade benefits to a country,  the President must give equal consideration to whether a country has met both trade criteria and labor standards. 
   For example, before the favorable trade benefits available in this legislation can be granted, the President must determine not only that a country has demonstrated a commitment to undertaking its WTO obligations on or ahead of schedule, and the extent to which a country provides protection of intellectual property rights, but also the extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker rights. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased the Conference Report retained the Levin-Moynihan amendment requiring the President to take into consideration the extent to which a country provides internationally recognized worker rights, including child labor, collective bargaining, the use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and labor standards before the trade benefit can be granted to a Caribbean Basin beneficiary country. 
   The Levin-Moynihan provision sets an important precedent of promoting standards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights as part of our trade relationships by considering progress toward those goals when unilaterally granting a trade benefit. 
   Most CBI countries are signatories of the International Labor Organization conventions. Considering the extent to which these countries abide by their own international obligations is the least we can do when considering whether they deserve to receive unilateral trade preferences from us. 
   The bill is further strengthened by another important precedent setting provision. The Conference Report also retained the Harkin amendment on Child Labor. As a result, this legislation, for first time, codifies in U.S. trade law ILO convention language on Child Labor by amending the Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify that the ban on articles made with forced and/or indentured labor includes those articles made with forced and/or indentured child labor. It also, for the first time, conditions U.S. trade benefits on meeting child labor standards by adding a new eligibility criterion to the Generalized System of Preferences, which also apply to the eligibility criteria under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, to provide that the President shall not designate a country for benefits if it has not implemented its obligations to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. 
   I hope this legislation will help to bring about greater economic development and democracy to the important regions of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. Because of this hope, and because of the provisions I have mentioned above, I will vote for this bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend, hundreds of thousands of mothers and ``honorary mothers'' will convene in Washington, DC and communities around the country to call for sensible gun legislation for safe kids. 
   On Sunday, Americans will unite for the Million Mom March, the first-ever national march for gun-safety. The mothers from Michigan and around the country come from all walks of life. They live in cities, in suburbs and in rural America. They are of all races, all religions and all political persuasions. They are our friends and neighbors, our community leaders. 
   On Mothers' Day, 2000, these ``mothers and others'' will join together to grieve over the loss of their loved ones, and the loss of more than 4,000 young people who are killed by gunfire each year. 
   Among these mothers will be Veronica McQueen, the Michigan mother who lost her six year old daughter, Kayla Rolland, to gun violence earlier this year. Ms. McQueen said, ``I just don't want to see another parent have to bury another baby over this, over something that is preventable, something that is very, very preventable.'' 
   Gun violence is preventable. But mothers can not act alone. Mothers in the Million Mom March know: In order to reduce the level of gun violence in their homes and communities, Congress must pass legislation to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. 
   Some of us in this Congress have heard the cry of families around this country and worked to pass sensible legislation to protect our nation's children. That legislation would limit access to guns by prohibited persons by, among other things, closing the gun show loophole-- applying background checks to guns sold at gun shows. 
   The Lautenberg-Kerrey gun show amendment that passed in the Senate,  but not in the House of Representatives, is one of the most important provisions we can pass this Congress. It will close the loophole that allows criminals and other prohibited persons to buy guns at gun shows that they would not otherwise be permitted to purchase. 
   It a loophole that is often exploited by those who do not want to undergo background checks--including Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine killers. Harris and Klebold used four semiautomatic assault weapons in their now infamous attack on their classmates. Of the four guns, three were purchased by Robyn Anderson at a gun show in Adams County, Colorado. 
   Robyn, who was 18 at the time, bought three semiautomatic assault weapons for her younger friends. She later testified before the Colorado Legislature about her purchase and the need to close the gun show loophole. She said: ``Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday..... While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check.'' 
   Robyn continues: ``I was not asked any questions at all. There was no background check. All I had to do was show my driver's license to prove that I was 18. Dylan got a shotgun. Eric got a shotgun and a black rifle that he bought clips for. He was able to buy clips and ammunition without me having to show any I.D. The sellers didn't write down any information.'' 
   ``I would not have bought a gun for Eric and Dylan if I had had to give any personal information or submit any kind of check at all. I think it was clear to the sellers that the guns were for Eric and Dylan. They were the ones asking all the questions and handling all the guns.'' 
   Robyn concluded: ``I wish a law requiring background checks had been in effect at the time. I don't know if Eric and Dylan would have been able to get guns from another source, but I would not have helped them. It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.'' 
   The Columbine killers took advantage of the gun show loophole and the result was deadly. Congress has the chance to close this loophole with the Lautenberg amendment. That amendment requires prospective purchasers to undergo background checks at gun shows and gives law enforcement up to three business days to those checks if there is any potentially disqualifying information--as set forth in the current Brady law. 
   Honest, law-abiding Americans are not affected by these background checks. 72 percent of the checks are completed within three minutes, and 95 percent are cleared within two hours. FBI records reveal that the five percent of people whose background checks take more than 24 hours to complete, are 20 times more likely to have a criminal record or otherwise be prohibited from accessing weapons. 
   Congress must pass legislation that gives law enforcement up to three business days, when needed, to complete background checks at gun shows, and truly close the gun show loophole. As of this day, Congress has failed to do so, and has subsequently failed the families of the Columbine victims and others who have lost loved ones to gunfire. 
   On this Sunday, I will march with the families of those victims from Michigan and around the country, who are calling on Congress to end their agony. In the words of one mother, it's time to turn tears into action. Congress must pass ``sensible gun laws for safe kids.'' Let's start by closing the gun show loophole today. It's time to end the plague of gun violence on America's children.

   Mr. LEVIN. I will take 30 seconds to read two paragraphs about the language in the letter from Wesley Clark:  
   These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans. 
   Setting a specific deadline for U.S. pull-out would signal to the Albanians the limits of the international security guarantees providing for their protection. This, in turn, would give them cause to rearm and prepare to protect themselves from what they would view as an inevitable Serbian reentry. The more radical elements of the Albanian population in Kosovo would be encouraged to increase the level of violence directed against the Serb minority, thereby increasing instability as well as placing U.S. forces on the ground at increased risk.  
   Mr. Milosevic, in anticipation of the pullout and ultimate breakup of KFOR, would likely encourage civil disturbances and authorize the increased infiltration of para-military forces to raise the level of violence. He would also take other actions aimed at preparing the way for Serbian military police reoccupation of the province.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator CLELAND and Senator ROBERTS for instituting this bipartisan dialogue relating to the global role of the United States. We normally only discuss these issues when a real-world contingency is looming and we do so under significant time constraints and within the dynamic of rapidly unfolding crises. This dialogue, which allows us to discuss these issues in a better setting, will hopefully contribute in a better understanding of the various perspectives on these issues and may bring us closer to a consensus on the fundamental issue of the global role of the United States. 
   This week's subject--``Multilateral Organizations''--is a very broad area. I will confine my remarks to those multilateral organizations that have responsibilities relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. I have in mind organizations like the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the mutual defense treaties to which the United States is a party. 
   I would like to briefly discuss several recent international crises and the role that the various multilateral organizations played in addressing those crises. I want to note, at the outset, that sometimes they were successful and sometimes they failed. 
   Mr. President, I don't know how many of my colleagues have ever been to Dubrovnik. It is an ancient and breathtakingly beautiful seaside city on Croatia's Dalmatian coast. When the Yugoslav Army subjected Dubrovnik to indiscriminate shelling in October 1991, resulting in the systematic destruction in the old city and the loss of many civilian lives, the European Union or the Western European Union should have used force to end this barbarity in their own backyard. If they had, the ensuing damage and loss of life throughout the Balkans might have been avoided. Instead of acting with force, however, the European Union declined to take any forceful action. For its part, the UN Security Council imposed an international embargo on the supply of arms to the combatants, thus succeeding in locking in the advantage that the Yugoslav Army enjoyed. It doesn't appear that NATO even considered taking action at that stage of the Balkan conflict. This was an example of the inability or unwillingness of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO and other multilateral organizations to effectively deal with a real-world crisis that had the potential of spreading. 
   It should be noted that NATO has substantial forces under its command but the United Nations does not have a standing UN army, nor, in my view, should it. The United Nations is dependent upon the political will of its members to supply the forces and the financial resources to take action. It is ironic that politicians of all nations feel free to criticize the United Nations for failing to successfully carry out its missions but the reality is that any failure of the United Nations is a failure of the UN member nations to provide the UN with the necessary means for its missions. We can't have it both ways--we can't refuse to provide the UN with the necessary means to do its job and then hammer the UN for its failings.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member of my staff, an advisor, and a man I feel honored to call my friend, Gordon Kerr. 
   Gordon, who has served as my Chief of Staff since 1982, has retired from government service to join the National Trust for Historic Preservation as the Director of Congressional Affairs. His 17 years as my top aide made him the dean of Senate Chiefs of Staff. 
   Gordon has served me for these many years in a variety of ways. He has been an invaluable advisor on issues of public policy and legislative strategy, as well as on personal and political matters. He has a clear-eyed, straightforward, right-in-your-face way of evaluating issues and events, and expressing his opinion about them which makes it nearly impossible to walk a bad idea past him. At least not without his calling you on it. 
   And yet, the first thing that anyone who knows Gordon immediately says is, ``what a wonderful human being''. How does a plain-speaking, realist like Gordon, come to be so uniformly regarded with such warmth and affection? It's simple when you think about it. Gordon is so open, principled, ethical and kind-hearted in his approach to the people he comes in contact with that it is nearly impossible to take offense at his candid advice. I'm reminded of what I've read about Robert Kennedy who also was known both for his brusque, sometimes harsh candor, but also for his high principles, and thoughtful consideration of others. ``My, he is unassimilated, isn't he?'' poet Robert Lowell was reported to have said when he first met him. 
   In all, Gordon spent more than 30 years on Capitol Hill, beginning as a Legislative Assistant for former-Congressman James Scheuer of New York in 1970, joining former-Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas in 1973, and then working for former-Congressman Jonathan Bingham of New York from 1973 until 1982, when he joined my staff as Chief of Staff. Gordon is a graduate of Yale University with a B.A. degree in Political Science and he holds a Masters degree in Public Administration with Distinction from American University, awarded in 1980. He served in the United States Navy as an Intelligence Officer for three years. 
   In 1990, Gordon served as my campaign manager. Former Senator Eugene McCarthy, with his wonderful irreverent sense of humor, once remarked that practicing politics is a little ``like being a football coach; you have to be smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important.'' Well, Gordon is a brilliant strategist, an outstanding ``coach'', and although his acute sense of humor would appreciate Senator McCarthy's self-deprecating quip, nonetheless he's always known the importance of the game. He's proud of the work he's done in the Senate as a public servant, and rightly so. And, he's proud of his work in the world of campaigns and politics, doing his part on that tough battleground. He was ever-conscious of the role of politics, which we sometimes tend to forget, in the accountability which is at the heart of the democratic system. 
   Characteristic of Gordon is his ability to see things from a new, fresh, sometimes unique angle. In a time when even the public policy debate is increasingly driven by political polls, television sound-bites, and oversimplified sloganeering, it was particularly valuable to me to have his contributions. Even when I did not ultimately adopt his viewpoint or accept his recommendation, having the benefit of Gordon's input nearly always informed my decisions. 
   While Gordon has been a dedicated public servant and loyal and hard-working employee, his first priority has always been his wonderful family. His love of his wife Suzy, his son Charlie and daughter Sarah were evident in his voice whenever he spoke of them and in the special sparkle in his eyes when he was with them. I know I speak not only for myself and the Levin family, but for the entire Levin staff and many in the Senate family, when I say we will miss Gordon and the Kerr family. Fortunately, in his new role at the National Trust for Historic Preservation he won't be too far away. 
   Mr. President, I owe Gordon Kerr a great debt for the loyal service which he has performed; and I believe that all of us here in the Senate, in my home state of Michigan, and in the nation, owe a debt of gratitude to him and the many like him who serve us here. This tribute to Gordon Kerr, in a small way, is an effort to recognize that role.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am supporting Senate passage of S. 1198, a bill to provide a three year pilot program for GAO review of certain agency rule makings. These are rule makings where the Chairman or Ranking Member of a committee of jurisdiction in the House or the Senate has requested such a review after the rule has been published as proposed. 
   As first introduced and considered in the Governmental Affairs Committee, I  was opposed to this bill. I was concerned that it created a two track rule making process, putting GAO in the shoes of the rule making agency and having GAO carry out its own interpretation of the public comments, scientific studies and economic analyses involved in the development of the rule. But through the work of Senator THOMPSON and Senator LIEBERMAN, the bill has been reworked and refined to a point where it may provide the agencies, Congress and the public with helpful information in evaluating the work of a rule making in progress without jeopardizing the separate and distinct roles played by the Executive and Legislative branches in the regulatory process. 
   As most of my colleagues know, I, along with Senator THOMPSON, have been fighting for years for a regulatory reform bill that would establish clear cost-benefit analysis standards for federal rule making agencies. I believe it is very important that federal agencies do a reasonable and proficient job of assessing the potential costs and the potential benefits of a proposed regulatory option and that they inform the public and Congress of those costs and benefits and tell us whether it's likely that the benefits of a proposed rule justify the costs. If an agency can't make that determination or if an agency concludes that the benefits of a rule don't justify the costs, then it should have the obligation to tell us why it is going ahead with the regulation. That, to me, is common sense. And it's particularly important in light of recent studies which show that numerous rules issued by federal agencies don't have benefits that justify the costs. We need to know why and in the future, with that information, we can decide whether we want to regulate under those circumstances. But Senator THOMPSON and I, despite a wide ranging group of supporters and the commitment of the Administration to sign the bill, have been frustrated in our efforts to get such a bill passed. 
   I think passing The Regulatory Improvement Act, S. 746, should be our first priority--getting the basic systems in place--and then once passed, consider an evaluative role for GAO in reviewing what agencies are doing in response to the requirements of that new law. But in the face of entrenched opposition to the Regulatory Improvement Act, the Governmental Affairs Committee has pushed ahead with the GAO bill, and given the significant amendments made to the bill during the Committee's markup and the amendment we are adopting here, on the Senate floor, today, I am willing to help advance this legislation now. The amendments to which I refer did several important things, including: specifying that GAO's role is to review the work of the agency and not the substance of the rule; beginning GAO's review after the rule has been published as proposed; and ensuring the existing discretion and authority of both the rule making agencies and the GAO. 
   Mr. President, I would like to confirm with the chairman and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, if they would, my understanding of certain provisions of this bill. First, I understand from this legislation that the rule making agencies retain their authority and discretion with respect to the issuance of rules. Nothing in this bill is intended to alter an agency's authority or discretion with respect to a rule making. Is that right?

   Mr. LEVIN. And finally, it is my understanding that when GAO issues its report on a rule pursuant to this legislation, that report, like the audit reports GAO issues now, will allow for the subject agency to respond to the findings and comments of GAO and will embody the agency's response in the GAO report. Is that right?

   Mr. LEVIN. In short, then, this legislation neither expands or contracts the authority of GAO in reviewing an agency's rule making nor does it expand or contract a rule making agency's authority to develop or issue a rule. The legislation establishes a process by which a chairman or ranking member of a committee of jurisdiction can request GAO after a proposed rule is published, to review the rule and report to Congress within 180 days, and it gives GAO the staff resources to carry those reviews out. Is that right?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the year that has passed since the tragic events at Columbine High School has been a time of soul searching for many Americans. We have had to ask ourselves some troubling questions. How did we let this happen? Why have we failed to pass sensible gun safety measures? Why doesn't the safety of our children count as much in Congress as the lobbying muscle of the National Rifle Association, NRA? Why did it take 15 deaths at Columbine to get us to take notice? Why wasn't a single death of a school child enough to make us realize the danger to which we have exposed our children in schools across the land? 
   Speeches alone will not turn the tide in the battle over sensible gun laws. But those of us who believe we must do more to close the loopholes in the law which give minors access to guns have to match the single-mindedness of a single issue group like the NRA with our own focused determination. 
   Just a few weeks ago, knowing that Congress was about to recess after again failing to take action on gun safety legislation, I offered these words:  
   For the students of Columbine, every day is a struggle, every day takes another act of courage. There is nothing we can do in Congress to change that, but there is something we can do to protect other students from the nightmares, the anger, and the pain, as told by these students. Congress owes it to Columbine and to the American people to try to end school shootings and reduce access to guns among young people. As of the one-year anniversary, Congress has failed to do so.  
   Over the last year, many Americans have decided to speak out on this issue. They are fed up with the intolerable level of gun violence in this country. They are outraged by the sight of a chain of preschoolers fleeing hand-in-hand from a deranged gunman. And, they are disheartened by the thought of a first grader shooting another first grader. 
   On Mothers' Day, May 14, they will bring a powerful message to Washington and to 30 communities across the Nation, including Lansing: it is time for Congress to pass commonsense gun legislation. What began 9 months ago, with two mothers and unparalleled dedication, has become the Million Mom March, the first-ever national march for gun safety. As a Dad who supports this march, I plan to walk along side Michigan mothers, future mothers, and all those willing to be ``honorary mothers'' calling for sensible gun laws and safe kids. 
   In a few weeks, another school year will come to an end, but the push to enact sensible gun legislation will continue during this Congress, and every one thereafter, until we get it done. And, because of the efforts of the Million Mom Marchers and other Americans who are speaking out on this issue, I believe we will prevail.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I read the committee report relative to this constitutional amendment from beginning to end. I did so because of the extraordinarily important issue which has been raised by Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN, and others: an effort on their part to provide some compassion and some relief to victims of crime. I have tremendous respect for their effort and those of their cosponsors. 
   After reading the committee report and giving a lot of thought to this issue, I have decided to oppose the amendment for a number of reasons. 
   First of all, we all start with the proposition that we want victims to have rights and Congress and the State legislatures should act to provide those rights. I do not think there is a lot of dispute about that issue. The question that is before us in this constitutional amendment is whether or not the way to achieve that goal is through an amendment to our basic document. 
   I believe it is fundamentally wrong to amend the Constitution for a number of reasons. First, the desired goals can be achieved by statute. Every State has a constitutional amendment or a statute which protects victims' rights. I do not believe there is one statute or one constitutional amendment in any State protecting victims' rights that has been held to be unconstitutional. 
   One of the complaints seems to be that State statutes and State constitutional provisions are not being enforced adequately. Take, for example, a story that Marlene Young, executive director of the National Organization for Victim Assistance, brought to the attention of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution in February. This is what she said:  
   Just within the past 2 weeks, our office received a copy of a letter published in the Sumter (Georgia) Free Press. It reads in part: ``I write this letter as a victim, not only of the person who violated me but as a victim of a system gone bad. ..... I was sexually battered here in Sumter County. I chose to press charges. Several days after the arrest and release of the accused, I received a packet from the court which included a list of my rights as defined by Georgia State law. I should have received this information from (the detective) the day I gave my statement. Georgia Law states that the investigator will provide the victim with a copy of Georgia Victims Bill of Rights in plain English upon initial contact. ..... Victims are everywhere and we have the right to be protected under Georgia Law. How many other victims are there who don't know what their rights are because the agencies are not working together? Lucky for me, to date, I have not been further injured by the accused. Others in this country may not be as lucky as I have been. It is time the victims of crimes be treated with respect and the laws set forth by the State of Georgia be followed. At what point are the laws of this state important to the authorities?''  
   So, the problem in that case, and in so many other cases, was not that the law in Georgia was incapable of protecting the victim; the problem was that the law was not carried out or enforced. Georgia has a State statute guaranteeing victims' rights, and the officials in Sumter County did not abide by that statute or implement it in her case. Is that a reason for a Federal constitutional amendment? Or is it, instead, a plea to the Georgia attorney general--who supports a constitutional victims' rights amendment, by the way, as is documented by his signature on a letter to us--to enforce the laws of his State? I argue that it is the latter. 
   Then we have the extraordinary testimony of Professor Laurence Tribe. Professor Tribe starts our with the proposition that:  
   The States and Congress, within their respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative authority to enact rules protecting these rights,  
   referring to the rights of victims. 
   Then he says:  
   The problem ..... is that such rules are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia. .....  
   What Professor Tribe is saying is that it is justifiable to amend the Constitution of the United States because statutes that are on the books are not enforced. That argument not only falls short of Madison's test that there be a ``great and extraordinary'' need before the Constitution is amended, it does not even come close. 
   It is particularly inappropriate to amend the Constitution when the interests sought to be protected are so complex and are still in formation. The question of who is a victim alone is a subject of much discussion. 
   We have had tragic instances in recent history, in New York City and in Oklahoma City, where the bombings of buildings created literally hundreds of victims--the families of those who were killed and the survivors. 
   Are all of them to be given the protection that is set forth in this constitutional amendment? What restrictions can be put on their rights by statute? What about persons making false claims against others, charging others with a crime? That person, an alleged victim, is given standing to argue against bond in order to keep the person he falsely accused in jail, without bond, awaiting a trial. 
   We have had too many instances of false accusations, including one recent notorious story of schoolteacher of 32 years, who taught not too far from here, and was falsely accused by his students of sexual harassment and sexual assault. 
   The possibility for injustices of many varieties should be explored, as they are currently being explored in the 50 States, all of which have either statutes or constitutional amendments that provide various means of protection for victims. 
   The pending amendment will be implemented by congressional enactment. Congress will be legislating for 50 State criminal court systems, which handle  95 percent of the criminal cases in this country. Far better for us to pass legislation that will strengthen victims' rights in Federal criminal cases, over which we have jurisdiction, and test the dozens of critical concepts which are involved in the effort to provide victims with rights, including: Who victims are? What is the impact on prosecutions? Is it negative, as some in law enforcement believe? Will there be undue delays caused by the meaning of the many issues that are open to litigation?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, as the one-year anniversary of the Columbine shooting approached, rumors of copycat violence prompted panic among teachers and students. Principals and administrators sensitive to such rumors heightened security by bringing in police protection and extra security guards. Other districts relied on parents and community volunteers to monitor school activity, and still others canceled classes altogether rather than suffer the fate of a school shooting, or even the threat of one. 
   For the most part, on the day the nation remembered Columbine, the rumors turned out to be just that--rumors. But the day did not go by without an act of copycat violence. The tragedy occurred, not here in the United States, but in Ottawa in the province of Ontario, Canada. 
   An article in the Ottawa Citizen describes the attack by a 15-year-old boy as one directly linked to the Columbine killings. The teen-age boy was apparently obsessed with the school massacre, and reportedly had photographs of the Columbine killers posted in his school locker. Students remember the accused counting down the days in eager anticipation of the exact moment Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began their reign of terror. 
   In many ways, the student in Ottawa had similar experiences to those of Harris and Klebold. Classmates teased him because of his appearance. He felt depressed and suicidal. He longed to be noticed, and perhaps thought this act of violence would give him the notoriety he craved. And so, exactly one year and a few minutes after the Columbine massacre began, a boy in Ottawa picked up his backpack and pulled out his weapon. 
   Both scenarios seem similar but there is one critical difference between the now infamous April 20th act of violence in Littleton and the more recent one in Ottawa that garnered virtually no attention. That crucial, critical difference--the weapon. 
   Despite the Canadian boy's obsession with Columbine, his copycat crime was not carried out with an arsenal of semiautomatic guns, but with a kitchen knife. The weapon he pulled from his backpack caused great pain and anguish, but in the end, none of the five people he stabbed sustained any life-threatening injuries. By comparison, the Columbine rampage left fifteen dead and more than two dozen injured, some of whom still have fragments of ammunition lodged deep in their bodies. 
   The circumstances of these cases were similar, but the outcomes were different because one country successfully limits access to firearms among young people, and one does not. In Canada, citizens are subject to licensing and registration requirements and have limited access to handguns and certain assault weapons. In the United States, our gun laws are so riddled with loopholes a 15 year old can legally possess an assault rifle. 
   I've often made the point that Canadian children, who watch the same movies and television programs, and play with the same toys and video games, are far safer than their American counterparts. The key difference between these children is not morals, religion or family, the difference is access to guns. 
   How else can one explain that in 1997, the U.S. rate of death involving firearms was approximately 14 per 100,000, compared to Canada's rate of 4 per 100,000? In 1997, in my hometown of Detroit, there were 354 firearm homicides. In Windsor, the Canadian town that is across the river, there were only 4 firearm homicides for that same year. Accounting for population, Detroit's firearm homicide rate was 18 times higher than Windsor's.  
   Congress does not have to pass Canadian-style gun control laws to reduce the number of American firearm casualties, but surely we need to reduce access to firearms among minors.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to the first Jewish congregation in the state of Michigan, Temple Beth El. The congregation, whose first services were held in 1850 by twelve families in Detroit, begins the celebration of its 150th anniversary this year with a series of special events. Beginning in May with a Musical Revue and concluding with a benefit in November, the events will bring together members of the congregation as well as thousands of others from throughout the metropolitan Detroit area. 
   Founded at a time of unrest in our nation--when the debate over slavery was intensifying, the economy was booming, and the railroad was transforming American culture--Beth El began with German immigrants. Members of Beth El later joined in the Reform Judaism movement. By 1867, the congregation had replaced German with English as the language of instruction, and in 1873 Beth El was one of the charter members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations which brought together the Reform synagogues of America to establish an American rabbinical seminary. 
   Over the years, the congregation experienced steady growth, locating at several notable sites in Detroit. These include a temple that was constructed at Woodward and Eliot in 1903 (now the Bonstelle Theater which is owned and operated by Wayne State University) and a temple that was designed by the late Albert Kahn in 1922 and built at Woodward and Gladstone. Like these formidable architectural works that bear witness to the congregation's vision and contribution, Beth El's rabbis were pillars in the community and were instrumental in building and developing the Detroit Jewish community and the national institutions of the Reform movement. Rabbi Louis Grossman, Rabbi Leo Franklin, Rabbi B. Benedict Glazer, and Rabbi Richard Hertz are among those who are well-remembered for their significant leadership and prominent roles in helping to strengthen human relations and the cause of social justice. 
   In 1973, the congregation opened its doors to its newest home in Bloomfield Hills. Today it has a membership of over 1600 families. Under the spiritual leadership of Rabbi Daniel Syme, Rabbi David Castigilone, Rabbi Sheila Goloboy and Cantor Stephen DuBov. Temple Beth El continues to play an important role in the metropolitan Detroit Jewish community, and it is recognized as one of the foremost Reform congregations in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I would like to express my best wishes to Temple Beth El on the celebration of this milestone in their history as a major contributor to America's cultural strength and religious tradition. We all profit from the preservation and celebration of individual and religious freedom that Temple Beth El so well embodies. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating the congregation of Temple Beth El and Rabbi Daniel Syme for achieving 150 years as a ``home that welcomes all of Detroit's Jewish community'' and as a hallmark of spiritual development.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 85th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Each year we need to remember and honor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to have with us today. 
   During the 8-year period from 1915 to 1923, approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes. April 24, 1915 serves as a marking point for the government-orchestrated carnage that took place under the Turkish Ottoman Empire. On this date, over 5,000 Armenians were systematically hunted down and killed in Constantinople. This number includes some 600 Armenian political and intellectual leaders who were taken to the interior of Turkey and systematically murdered.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak in support of the remarks that were made earlier today by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID. Senator REID spoke eloquently about the need for Robert Ray, the independent counsel who assumed duties when Kenneth Starr resigned, to bring that investigation of the President to a close. 
   The report earlier this week in the Washington Post that Mr. Ray is increasing his budget and his staff in contemplation of a possible indictment of the President after the President leaves office is chilling. Senator REID is right to remind Mr. Ray that this is the United States and not a country such as the old Soviet Union where the abuse of the administration of law was used as a political weapon. 
   Mr. Ray apparently justifies the continuation of his office and his consideration of an indictment of the President because of his commitment to the principle that no one is above the law. 
   Certainly in this country that principle is fundamental. That was the theory behind establishing the independent counsel law in the first place. But that principle has two other equally important applications. One is that it means Mr. Ray himself is not above the law; and, two, while it is imperative that top Government officials be treated no better than private citizens, it is equally important that they should also be treated no worse. 
   The independent counsel law requires that the independent counsel operate as a normal U.S. attorney and that the independent counsel comply with the policies and practices of the Department of Justice. 
   We require this in the law because we do not want our top Government officials to be treated worse than a private citizen. Yes, we want to make sure our top Government officials do not get preferential treatment, but equally important, we do not want them to be treated unfairly either. 
   Mr. Ray projects he is going to spend an additional $3.5 million in the next 6 months sifting through the evidence to determine whether or not he should indict the President for perjury in a civil case. 
   Do any of us think that a U.S. attorney would spend 2 years and tens of millions of dollars investigating a possible perjury charge in a civil suit to begin with? Does anyone think a U.S. attorney would then ask for or receive six new attorneys, additional investigators and contractors, and an additional $3.5 million of taxpayers' money on top of the 40 staff people and above the $52 million that the office had already spent to investigate? 
   The facts in the Lewinsky case have been sliced and diced and parsed and sifted through over and over again. They have been brutally revealed and thoroughly reviewed detail by detail. 
   If Mr. Ray is not to be above the law himself, and if he is to abide by the principle he claims to hold dear, then he should do what a U.S. attorney would do in a case like this involving a private citizen--bring it to a close. 
   The purpose of the independent counsel law is to fairly investigate top Government officials so they are treated no better and no worse than a private citizen. It is, instead, being used to pillory. 
   Nineteen months ago, Mr. Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr--surely a dogged independent counsel--represented to Congress that he was going to end the investigation ``soon.'' That was Mr. Starr's word, ``soon.'' 
   Mr. Starr represented the following to the House of Representatives on September 11, 1998:  
   All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion. This Office will soon make final decisions about what steps to take, if any, with respect to the other information it has gathered.  
   Those were Mr. Starr's words 19 months ago when he made the representation to the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States that his office would soon make final decisions about what steps to take, if any. 
   Mr. Ray's statement, as reported in the Washington Post, that this is still an open investigation and that he wants six new attorneys and $3.5 million more belies Mr. Starr's formal representation to the Congress and to the  people. In commenting on Mr. Ray's latest statements, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist Maureen Dowd noted that even Javert, the driven policeman in the book ``Les Miserables,'' who was singularly focused on capturing Jean Valjean ``jumped into the Seine at some point.'' 
   I am not urging Mr. Ray to jump into the Potomac. I am saying--and I am confident that this is the opinion of the majority of the people in our country--that Mr. Ray needs to bring this investigation to a close and to do it now. 
   The Lewinsky matter is over. The Paula Jones case is over. They were traumatic times for the country. The public has suffered. The President has been punished. It is time to move on. To extend this investigation with new attorneys and more money and more time is to punish the country. The country doesn't deserve it.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one week from today, we will memorialize the worst school shooting tragedy in our nation's history. The very mention of Columbine High School strikes a nerve with the American public. It reminds us of a horrendous scene of children, screaming and running from their assailants, while SWAT-teams descended on to their otherwise calm neighborhood. On April 20, this year the nation will remember, but for the students of Columbine, those few hours of April 20, 1999 are replayed over and over again every day in their minds. 
   The survivors of Columbine revisit the massacre daily. They are reminded of that day by the fragments of ammunition in their bodies, or the scars cut deep in to their skin. When they see trenchcoats, they shudder, when they hear or smell fireworks, they get flashbacks. At such young ages, they have endured unimaginable physical and emotional pain. They have been poked and prodded by nurses, physicians, surgeons, physical, occupational and recreational therapists, and clinical psychologists. Some of them have found peace, others are still angry and frightened. A few can not tell their stories but many can tell them over and over again. 
   For Columbine-survivor Valeen Schnurr, ``The nights are always the worst.'' Valeen is in college now, but Columbine is still very much with her. She writes, ``Inevitably, I find my thoughts drifting into nightmares, terrifying images of the library at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. The sound of students screaming as explosives and gunshots echo through the school; the burning pain of the bullets penetrating my body; the sound of my own voice professing my faith in God; seeing my hands fill with my own blood; and my friend Lauren Townsend lying lifeless beside me as I try to wake her.'' 
   ``In the mornings when I look in the mirror, the scars I see on my arms and upper body always remind me that it's  not just a nightmare, but the memory of a real event that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The scars are a part of me now, but they help me to remember that I've been blessed with a second chance at life.'' 
   Another survivor, Kelsey Bane, talks about how she felt on her first day back at Columbine. ``On August 16, 1999, a new school year began. Only this year, I wasn't full of excitement. Instead, I was full of emotions I can't describe, because I was headed back to my school--Columbine High--for the first time since April 20. I was scared out of my mind, but I knew that whatever I did that day would determine the way I would live the rest of my life. So I went to school; I faced my fears and my nightmares from the past four months and got ready to begin a new school year.'' 
   Over the last year, ``[it] has gotten harder, as I expected it would. Sometimes I can't remember what used to occupy my thoughts, because now my mind is overwhelmed by these horrific experiences. Our lives will never be the same--and I don't think I will ever fully accept that.'' 
   Nicole Nowlen, who was a relatively new student when the tragedy occurred, wrote ``nine pieces of buckshot hit me; four exited and five are still inside. When school started at Chatfield High [in May], I wasn't physically ready, so I finished my 
   sophomore year with a tutor and went back to Columbine in August.'' 
   ``It's been like this roller-coaster ride ever since. October and November got too crazy. First they arrested a kid [from Columbine] for making threats to finish the job. Then there was the six-month anniversary, and Mrs. Hochhalter [the mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter who was badly injured] killed herself. In all my classes, the kids never stopped talking about the shooting. It was depressing, so I decided to be home schooled. 
   ``I started seeing a counselor in November.......Things are better now, so I'm not going anymore. I may go again, but for now I'm at a good point.'' 
   ``What helped me the most was Gerda Weissman Klein. She's a 75-year-old Holocaust survivor who came to speak at our school in January. She's really the only one who understands what happened to all of us.'' 
   For the students of Columbine, every day is a struggle, every day takes another act of courage. There is nothing we can do in Congress to change that, but there is something we can do to protect other students from the nightmares, the anger, and the pain, as told by these students. Congress owes it to Columbine to try to end school shootings and reduce access to guns among young people. As of this one-year anniversary, Congress has failed to do so. 
   Columbine victim Valeen Schnurr wrote, ``People on the outside don't realize how horrible it can actually be. We're the ones who can get everyone motivated and involved in making changes.'' I only hope Valeen is right. Her story should motivate Congress to strengthen our laws and save the lives of America's children. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, S. 2323. Stock options have traditionally been distributed only to highly salaried executives, used as an incentive to promote hard work on behalf of the company. As a company's bottom line improves due in part to the executive's efforts, the value of the company's stock increases, eventually rewarding the executive when he or she ultimately exercises the option and later sells the stock. I have long maintained that stock options ought be provided to all types of employee--whether hourly or salaried, management or clerica--and not just the top brass. That is why I introduced the Ending the Double Standards for Stock Options Act last Congress, which would have encouraged corporations to adopt plans in which a minimum of 50% of all options would go to non-management employees. After all, a company's success depends on the efforts of more than just its executives. 
   I am hopeful that the Worker Economic Opportunity Act will encourage the growth of broad-based employee stock option plans in corporate America. The Act excludes stock options from overtime pay calculations for hourly employees. Current law also excludes benefits like discretionary bonuses, employer-provided health insurance, and retirement benefits from overtime pay rates. But current law doesn't address stock options. Last year, the Department of Labor indicated that, without action by Congress, companies would likely have to include the value of stock options when figuring an hourly employee's overtime  pay rate. Corporate America has argued that the administrative and financial burdens associated with such inclusion, given a huge number of different employees having different amounts of options with different exercise dates and strike prices, outweigh the benefits of having a broad-based stock option plan. 
   This legislation is not inconsistent with my proposal to require the reporting of stock options as an expense on a company's financial statements, a key part of the Ending the Double Standards for Stock Options Act. Therefore, I support the Worker Economic Opportunity Act to remove a potential barrier to workers' participation in the prosperous American economy they helped create.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend of mine who is also a friend to the working men and women of Michigan, Edgar A. Scribner. Ed recently retired from his position as President of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO. 
   Ed Scribner began his working career with the Detroit Free Press in 1950, a career which was interrupted from 1952-1954 when he served his country in Korea with the United States Army. He has always been an active supporter of the rights of workers, and was elected Vice President of Teamster Local Union #372 in 1962. He also served his local as Trustee and President, and was selected for additional leadership positions with Michigan Teamsters Joint Council #43. In 1988, he was first elected President of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO, a position he has held until this year. 
   Ed's contribution to community life has truly known no bounds. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of numerous charities and took a leadership role on behalf of United Community Services, metro Detroit's Torch Drive agency. In 1992, duty called Ed in a new direction when he was elected to the Board of Governors of Wayne State University, helping one of the nation's leading urban research universities find new ways to serve metropolitan Detroit. 
   Through it all, as a labor leader, a humanitarian, and an education leader, Ed's calling card has been his sincerity. Those who know him have come to appreciate the genuine affection he holds for people. While he's never been reluctant to take a stand concerning the big issues of his day, Ed has never forgotten that in the end it's all about people and making their lives better. 
   Caring about people has been a way of life for Ed Scribner, not just a job. So I have no doubt that even in his retirement, Ed will continue to serve his community in many ways. I am sure that his children, and especially his grandchildren, will keep him at least as busy as his commitments to the many non-profit and educational institutions with which he is currently involved. And I also know that the men and women of the AFL-CIO can count on Ed to continue to stand with them in their ongoing efforts on behalf of the working people of our nation. 
   Mr. President, I know my colleagues will join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Ed Scribner, President of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO, on the occasion of his retirement.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the budget resolution which the majority has presented to the Senate. In my judgement, this budget represents the wrong priorities. It places too much reliance on risky estimates about the Federal surplus over the next five years and provides for an unwise tax cut in lieu of greater reduction in the national debt and emphasis on protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as investments in the future of young Americans through education. 
   For the past several months we have heard a familiar refrain--that the budget of the Federal Government will be in surplus over the next ten years. In fact, all throughout the first session of this Congress, the American people were told over and over again that, after years of running huge deficits, the Federal budget was about to start running enormous surpluses--tens, or even hundreds, of billions of dollars per year. While these were only projections, they seem constantly to improve, painting a very rosy scenario of America's fiscal future--that is until Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills. Shortly after passage, the Congressional Budget Office, in its End of Session Summary, projected a $17 billion on-budget deficit for this year--meaning $17 billion of the Social Security surplus would be used--the result of the tens of billions of dollars in so-called ``emergency'' spending. In the intervening months, the CBO has revised its forecasts and now projects a $26 billion surplus for the current fiscal year, assuming no supplemental appropriations and no downturn in the economy. But we won't really know whether we have a surplus or a deficit for fiscal year 2000 until it ends in October. By the same token, we won't really know for sure whether we'll have a 10-year surplus or deficit until fiscal year 2010 draws to a close. 
   With that in mind, I want to share a reality check on the projected ten year budget surplus and on the tax cuts proposed by the Senate Budget Committee majority and by Governor George W. Bush. In January of this year, the Congressional Budget Office released three surplus estimates, each based on a different assumption about the level of discretionary spending over the next ten years. These estimates were updated by the CBO on March 9th. The largest non-Social Security surplus estimate, $1.95 trillion, assumes that Congress will spend decreasing amounts for discretionary spending through fiscal year 2002, as required by the existing budget caps created in law and that discretionary spending will then increase at the rate of inflation. But Congress basically ignored these caps for the fiscal year 2000 budget passed back in November. Almost nobody believes it is realistic to assume that they will be adhered to for the next two years. 
   The second surplus estimate, $1.89 trillion, assumes that we freeze discretionary spending for the next ten years at the fiscal year 2000 level. Freezing spending at this year's level for the next ten years means that we can't maintain Federal services at their current levels because we'd be ignoring the effect of inflation. So we'd be cutting federal services from their current level for ten years in a row. Over ten years this amounts to an $835 billion cut in current Federal services or 12%. That's a totally unrealistic assumption on which to project a surplus. Just look at the last ten years--an era supposedly characterized by fiscal restraint: Non-defense discretionary spending grew at a nominal annual average rate of almost 5%--that's 2% above inflation. The last three years, during which the budget caps have supposedly been in effect, total discretionary spending has outpaced inflation by 1.2%. 
   The third CBO surplus estimate, $893 billion, is by far the most realistic--and indeed it too may be optimistic. This estimate assumes that discretionary spending will keep pace with inflation for the next ten years. If spending follows that path and if the economy performs reasonably well, the surplus, exclusive of Social Security revenues, could amount to $171 billion over the next five years and $893 billion over the next ten years. I emphasize the words ``if'' and ``could.'' This surplus estimate is just that--an estimate, far from certain, that depends upon several assumptions about things like economic growth rates, interest rates, and discretionary spending. If any of these assumptions is off, even by just a little, the surplus could shrink considerably. 
   Obviously, Congress can't legislate economic growth or interest rates. But, Congress can and does have responsibility for discretionary spending, taxes, managing the National Debt and the continued strength of programs like Medicare and Social Security. So, we must carefully analyze and try to  project faithfully and fairly what happens to the surplus when we look at our promises and our responsibilities to the American people over the next ten years: our responsibility to help provide seniors with access to the prescription drugs they need to live, our responsibility to our children to pay down the publicly held National Debt, our responsibility to protect Medicare, and our responsibility to stimulate the research and development of new technologies necessary to continue to strengthen the economy in the new millennium. 
   Both parties seem to agree that the rising cost of prescription drugs makes some type of prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries a necessity. The President's plan would have no deductible and pay half of all beneficiaries' prescription drug costs up to $5,000 when fully phased in by 2009. If you subtract the plan's ten year cost of $98 billion from the $893 billion surplus estimate of the CBO, the surplus shrinks to $795 billion. 
   The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is estimated to encounter problems beginning in 2010, when expenditures start to exceed income. The difference will be made up by using the interest income on securities held by the Trust Fund. Beginning in 2015, the Trust Fund will have to start drawing down principal to meet its obligations. And by 2023, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be insolvent--with principal depleted and income able to meet only 80% of its obligations. In any case, the Concord Coalition estimates that the entire Medicare program will suffer a huge cash deficit on the order of over $250 billion over the next ten years, unless substantial changes are made and/or dollars infused into it. The President's plan calls for both and he would provide $299 billion to extend Medicare's solvency beyond 2030. When these dollars are allocated to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, they are not paid out immediately to beneficiaries. And since current law requires that these dollars be invested in government securities, this allocation would also reduce the publicly held National Debt. So, if you subtract $299 billion from the surplus for protecting Medicare which also helps pay down the Debt, the surplus shrinks to $496 billion over the next ten years. 
   Given those other demands on the budget surplus, the President proposes tax cuts 
   targeted toward low and moderate income Americans: increasing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, education incentives, health care incentives, encouraging charitable contributions. If we subtract the net cost of these tax cuts, $256 billion, the surplus shrinks to $240 billion. 
   If we ignored these priorities and did nothing with the surplus, under current law, it would automatically go toward debt reduction. With the exception of programs such as Medicare and Social Security, each dollar of the surplus that gets allocated to one of these important domestic priorities cannot go toward reducing the publicly held National Debt and that costs money because of the interest that must be paid. While the exact amount of interest varies depending on how the surplus is allocated, the Office of Management and Budget estimates this cost to be $64 billion. When we subtract this amount, the surplus shrinks to $176 billion. 
   At this point, if the economy keeps up and projections are accurate, we'll still have a surplus of $176 billion over ten years. But all this math still doesn't take several things into account--things like a 3.2% average annual increase in the rate of discretionary spending--which was the annual average discretionary spending increase from FY97-FY00. If we continued at that historic pace, that would decrease the surplus by another $107 billion. If we don't assume that increase, given the budget committee action increasing defense spending, domestic discretionary spending for programs like Head Start, COPS, the Superfund, and hiring new teachers would have to be cut very substantially. And what of the tax cuts that the Senate or the House have already passed? Just one of these bills, the Bankruptcy Reform Bill, contains tax cuts that would decrease the surplus by another $103 billion over ten years. Also, over the next 10 years, up to 21 different tax provisions, such as the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, will need to be renewed by Congress or they will expire. Congress has routinely renewed these credits. This will cost another $100 billion over ten years. Finally, if Congress decides to provide relief to farmers suffering from droughts and other disasters, as well as low prices, and to healthcare providers reeling from prior-year Medicare cuts, that could cost another $60 billion over ten years. And the list goes on. 
   So, if we take into account certain important responsibilities over the next ten years, the surplus could easily turn into a deficit. That is the sobering reality of the situation. 
   Some have suggested that Congress' first priority in reaction to budget surpluses should be to cut taxes. Governor George W. Bush, has proposed such a plan. 
   Governor Bush proposes to cut taxes by roughly $483 billion over five years and $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. Even before factoring in the interest costs that result from this tax cut, the surplus would evaporate completely under Governor Bush's plan. 
   Bad enough, his proposed tax cut leaves nothing to protect Medicare or extend its solvency by one day. Nothing to pay down the publicly held National Debt. In fact, it would add hundreds of billions to the National Debt and cut into the Social Security surplus. The reality of the situation illustrated here is that, without spending a dime on any of America's other priorities, the Bush tax cut converts an $893 billion surplus into an $572 billion deficit, and that means cutting into the Social Security surplus by $572 billion. 
   Sinking back into the deficit ditch is the wrong direction for the budget and for the economy. We ought not to go in that direction. 
   The Budget Resolution now before the Senate goes in that same direction. The Budget Resolution contains $150 to $200 billion in tax cuts over five years. The Budget Resolution passed by House Republicans contains tax cuts which eat up 98% of CBO's $171 billion, five-year non-social security surplus. These tax cuts not only come at the expense of other domestic priorities, they endanger the on-budget surplus and threaten the Social Security surplus. To pay for this tax cut, Senate and House Republicans continue in the misguided direction of the Bush plan by proposing enormous cuts in domestic Federal services while giving lip service to priorities such as a Medicare prescription drug benefit. First, both the Senate and House Republican Budget Resolutions would cut many domestic Federal services by almost 10 percent over the next five years. Second, the Resolutions create a ``reserve fund'' of $40 billion that, in the Senate's version, could go toward a prescription drug benefit if a Medicare reform bill is introduced. I emphasize the words ``could'' and ``if.'' Unlike the tax provisions in the Budget Resolution--that direct the Finance Committee to produce legislation cutting taxes--there are no enforceable instructions compelling anyone in Congress to do anything when it comes to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. So the reality of Republican Budget is clearly a double standard: Serious action when it comes to a large tax cut, and loose language when it comes to prescription drugs. 
   What is particularly disturbing is that the House and Senate Republican budgets evade realistic scrutiny by producing only a 5-year plan. Last year, faced with the same situation, the Senate considered a ten year plan. This year, the majority hides the explosive effect of their tax breaks over the next ten years that could plunge the federal budget back into large deficits. 
   So, before we become too enchanted by the promise of huge surpluses in the hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars, before anyone writes any checks on surplus dollars, or enacts large tax cuts which are also difficult to reverse, I wanted to offer this reality check to show how, if Congress acts unwisely and with too little caution, the surplus boom could too easily turn into a deficit bust. 
   Mr. President, the Budget Resolution the Senate considers today in my judgement takes such a risk. It is premised on the shaky foundation of surplus projections reliant upon unrealistically large cuts in spending for domestic programs like Head Start, programs to reduce class size in schools,  clean up superfund pollution sites, and to hire new police officers. It does too little to protect Medicare and Social Security and to provide for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. And, it contains an unwise tax cut while hiding the exploding costs of that cut in future years. 
   While a few changes which I have supported have been made over the past few days, such as increasing Pell grants and devoting more dollars to veterans' health care, I cannot support this Budget Resolution. This budget emphaisizes the wrong priorities and runs the risk of heading back toward reliance on the Social Security surplus to keep us out of the deficit ditch.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record why I voted against Senator BOND's amendment yesterday. The Bond amendment states that ``It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in this resolution assume that no Federal funds may be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide any grant or other assistance to construct, operate, or otherwise benefit a smoke shop or other tobacco outlet.'' The broad language of the amendment could easily be interpreted to mean that the Department of Housing and Urban Development should not use federal funds to support any economic development project, including housing for senior citizens, which has a retail outlet that sells, among other things, cigarettes. To cut off federal support for such projects that have a retail outlet that sells cigarettes as one of hundreds of other items, is too extreme. Instead, I support nondiscriminatory legislation that targets establishments whose primary business is the sale of tobacco products.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to vote for the amendment--I believe most Members will--but we want to make sure we do not create an inequity, an unfairness in the process. We will be paying different amounts of money to the same people, same rank, and we may actually be giving the extra money to the wrong people. 
   Senator MCCAIN's amendment, it seems to me, has exactly the right purpose: to get rid of food stamps going to some members. But we have to do it right. Senator WARNER is going to be holding hearings in our committee on this whole food stamp situation. We, hopefully, can accomplish this goal in a way which does not create a discriminatory situation. 
   I have one last fact. We all should be glad to know the number of our service members on food stamps has gone down, from 19,400 in 1991 to 11,900 in 1995, to 6,300 in 1999. The number of people on food stamps has been going down dramatically, not only numerically but also as a percentage of the force.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the first time in the United States, a gun manufacturer has agreed to make major changes to the design, distribution and marketing of its products. In a historic settlement reached by Smith & Wesson, the Administration, and cities and states around the country, Smith & Wesson will make sweeping changes to its business practices. 
   Under the terms of the agreement, several cities and counties will drop lawsuits filed against Smith & Wesson in exchange for reforms designed to make guns safer and limit access to them by unauthorized users. Specifically, Smith & Wesson agreed to increased safety standards, such as the  inclusion of external locking devices on all of its guns immediately, and internal safety locks on its pistols within two years; more stringent performance standards for its handguns, including rigorous drop tests; and a commitment to include ``smart gun'' technology in its newly designed handguns within three years. 
   In addition, Smith & Wesson agreed to revamp the way it distributes and sells firearms. Smith & Wesson will conduct business transactions only with authorized distributors and dealers who abide by a code of conduct. The distributor or dealer must agree in writing to perform and complete a background check for all sales, including those at gun shows; impose limits on the bulk purchase of guns; implement a security plan to prevent firearm and ammunition theft; require juveniles to be accompanied by a parent or guardian where guns and ammo are stored or sold. Other parts of the voluntary agreement include a trust fund for a public service campaign about the risk of firearms in the home and lessons for proper home storage. Also, Smith & Wesson made assurances that their guns will not be marketed to appeal to children or criminals and will not be advertised in the vicinity of schools, high crime zones, or public housing. 
   Finally, with this agreement, a firearm manufacturer has agreed to the basic demands of the American people: to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. I hope other gun manufacturers will follow their lead and work to reduce the level of gun violence in America.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Mott Community College and Mr. Peter Levine, MPH on being selected as the 1999 Corporate and Individual Health Advocates of the Year by the American Lung Association of the Michigan-Genesee Valley Region. Mott Community College and Mr. Levine are being honored by the Lung Association for their efforts to encourage, promote and raise awareness about improving the health of the Genesee Valley Region. 
   Mott Community College (MCC) is a dynamic community institution serving the needs of all the residents of Genesee County. This commitment to community service is manifested in the school's efforts to promote public health on campus and in the community. MCC has implemented a pro-active lung health program that not only eliminates smoking in all campus buildings, but also assists smokers in their efforts to ``kick the habit''. MCC provides counseling for employees who desire to quit smoking, and its health insurance providers offer educational programs to support employees who desire to quit smoking. 
   In addition, MCC has become a leader in community service. The college encourages faculty and staff to serve on local boards for community-based, non-profit organizations, and the school allows employees to fulfill these commitments on company time, if necessary. The school also serves as a gathering place for community health special events. The annual MCC Health Fair brings community and health officials together, and Tipper Gore chaired a recent mental health town meeting on campus. MCC students and faculty in the health sciences share their expertise by assisting school groups, churches and the Genesee County Public Health Department with a variety of community health initiatives. 
   Peter Levine has served his community, state, and country in countless ways. He serves as the Executive Director of the Genesee County Medical Society. The Society is a progressive organization which seeks to be pro-patient and pro-physician. During Mr. Levine's tenure, the Medical Society has grown from a small association employing a few people into a set of four corporations serving the medical and general community with approximately 80 employees. The Society focuses on medical, social, bioethics, environmental health and resource allocation issues. 
   Mr. Levine has been on the faculty of Michigan State University since 1985, where he is currently an Associate Adjunct Professor in the College of Human Medicine. He has published extensively about health issues in scholarly and popular journals. In 1992, Health Care Weekly Review cited him as one of the eight most influential health care policy individuals or organizations in the State of Michigan. Peter Levine was a founding Board Member and volunteer for the Genesee County Free Medical Clinic. He also serves on the board of numerous civic and professional organizations. Currently he is the Chair of the Michigan Council of County Medical Society Executives. 
   Mr. President, I have mentioned only a small sampling of the many ways in which Charles Steward Mott Community College and Mr. Peter Levine have used their creativity, hard work and unflagging commitment to public service to make this community and our nation a better place to live. I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Mott Community College and Peter Levine for service on behalf of the Genesee Valley Region and State of Michigan.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Burton H. Boyum, who is being honored on April 13th for his significant contributions to the preservation of the history of mining in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
   Burton H. Boyum was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1919 and moved to the Upper Peninsula in 1941. He quickly learned to love the beauty of the U.P. and the outstanding character of its people. He worked as a mining engineer for one of the U.P.'s largest employers at the time, Cleveland Cliffs International, from his arrival in the U.P. until his retirement in 1984. Mr. Boyum's experience with Cleveland Cliffs inspired him to teach the public about the geology, mineralogy and mining heritage of his adopted home. 
   Mr. Boyum has contributed greatly to the preservation of the U.P.'s mining heritage throughout the years. In 1961, he was a founding Board Member of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association and was named its first Secretary. He served as President of the Board of the Association from 1973 until 1998, when he was named the first Chairman of the Board. Mr. Boyum has also served on the Advisory Commission of the Keweenaw National Historical Park, served as President of the Historical Society of Michigan, helped gain State approval for the Michigan Iron Industry Museum, and helped to create the Marquette Range Iron Mining Heritage Theme Park. He has written two books about the mining experience in the U.P., Saga of Iron Mining in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and The Mather Mine, and has also produced two videos about the history of U.P. mining. 
   As important as the mining experience has been to the U.P., Mr. Boyum also embraced the U.P.'s love for the outdoors and outdoor sports. He successfully campaigned for the creation of the National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Michigan, and served as its first President and Curator. He also helped to organize the Great Lakes Olympic Training Center Association and served as its President for 10 years. 
   Mr. President, the history of Michigan's Upper Peninsula is deeply intertwined with the iron and copper mining industries. Burton H. Boyum has served the people of the U.P. well by dedicating himself to the preservation of its mining heritage. I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him well and in thanking him for his efforts.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join Senator ABRAHAM in sponsoring this resolution which commends and recognizes the extraordinary successes of the Michigan State Spartans. 
   As we speak today, about 150,000 people are lining the parade route in Lansing, MI, after a rally at our capitol, to welcome home and cheer on our heroes. 
   College athletics is at best about more than winning. It is about hard work and determination and relying on teammates to overcome adversity. The Michigan State Spartans surely displayed all of those characteristics in their season-long drive to become the national champions. 
   Coming off a loss to Duke in the Final Four last year, many had picked MSU as this year's favorite to win the NCAA Tournament. However, when star point guard and former Big Ten Player of the Year Mateen Cleaves was sidelined with a stress fracture on his right foot early in the season, the hopes of a championship season seemed lost. But the Spartans never gave up. The rest of the team pulled together to play the first 13 games of the season without their emotional leader. 
   When Mateen returned to the basketball team, MSU went on to win their third straight Big Ten Championship, clinching the top seed in the Midwest region of the NCAA Tournament. 
   During the NCAA tournament the Spartans faced many challenges, winning come from behind victories against Utah, Syracuse, and Iowa State to reach the Final Four for the second straight year. After beating conference rival Wisconsin in the semifinals, the stage was set for Michigan State to take home their first National Championship title since Magic Johnson led the Spartans to victory over Indiana State in 1979. 
   Monday night the young Florida Gators played a great game, but their depth and energy didn't quite match the experience and determination of the Spartans. Mateen Cleaves led the team in scoring until five minutes into the second half when he was sent to the locker room with a sprained ankle. While many teams would have crumbled under the pressure of playing for the National Championship without their star player and floor leader, the Spartans came together like they have done all season long and their lead over the Gators grew. When the injured Cleaves came back onto the floor, limping up and down the court, his presence provided the emotional spark that the team needed to win by a final score of 89 to 76. 
   In today's sports world where, where many talented young players leave college early or don't go at all, and coaches skip from team to team it is refreshing to see the kind of dedication that these student athletes and their coach have shown. ``The Flintstones''--seniors Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson, and junior Charlie Bell, have become heroes and role models to those from their hometown of Flint. Senior A.J. Granger's often unsung heroics have proved how much these Spartans value the success of the team over individual accolades. The full roster of that extraordinary team is as follows: Al Anagonye, Jason Andreas, Adam Ballinger, Charlie Bell, Mike Chappell, Steve Cherry, Mateen Cleaves, A.J. Granger, Lorenzo Guess, Andre Hutson, Matt Ishbia, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Brandon Smith, David Thomas, and Adam Wolfe. 
   Coach Tom Izzo has spent his entire career in Michigan, including 12 years as an assistant under former Michigan State head coach, Jud Heathcote. They have set a wonderful example of what can happen when you are willing to combine patience, hard work, and dedication. 
   Those names belong in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. They are all being honored here for their teamwork, which produced a national champion. 
   Coach Tom Izzo has spent his entire career in Michigan, including 12 years as an assistant under former Michigan State head coach, Jud Heathcote. He and his assistants have set an extraordinary example of what can happen when you are willing to combine patience, hard work, and dedication. Indeed, the whole Michigan State family deserves credit because they truly represent, on and off the court, what we frequently talk about--family values. They believe in family, both at home and on the court. They act as a family and they play as a family. We owe them our congratulations and our thanks for that as well. 
   There is going to be a long list of bands in that parade going down Michigan Avenue in a few minutes. Many of the high school teams from around the State will be there. They have been invited to march. One of the groups, though, that I want to make special mention of in closing is the band from Tom Izzo's hometown of Iron Mountain. Tom Izzo is an ``Upper,'' as we say; he comes from the UP. His heart has always been close to Michigan and Michigan State. He is originally from the UP. It is a special treat for him and for all of us that one of the bands marching down Michigan Avenue today will be indeed from his hometown of Iron Mountain. 
   We also pay tribute to the Florida Gators. It was an extraordinary game. They deserve an awful lot of credit for what they did to bring themselves to the finals. I am sure that in the future their heroics will again prove that they will go far in these NCAA tournaments. Hopefully, they will again get to the finals and, hopefully, again lose to a Michigan team. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary couple from my home state of Michigan. David and Doreen Hermelin will be given the Dream Maker Award and the Rabbi Jacob Segal Award by Hillel Day School of Metropolitan Detroit on June 6, 2000. 
   It is truly fitting that among the honors David and Doreen will receive is the Dream Maker Award. The Award is given to those who have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to the community and especially to Jewish education. It can be fairly said that David and Doreen are ``Dream Makers,'' because they both have committed so much of their lives to making people's dreams come true. 
   One of David Hermelin's mottos is ``The harder you work, the luckier you get.'' Thanks to his and Doreen's hard work, countless people in Metro Detroit have found themselves wealthy in luck as well. David and Doreen have opened their home for hundreds of charitable fundraisers, and their efforts on behalf of these good causes do not stop with opening their front door. They both have personally raised tens of millions of dollars for organizations that serve people in need in Michigan and in Israel as well. David's reputation as a fundraiser has become so widely recognized, in fact, that he has been known to joke that people wouldn't recognize him if his hand was in his pocket. But as he often notes, he asks people to contribute their time or talents to those in need ``not until it hurts, but until it feels good.'' Maybe that's the secret to David and Doreen's seemingly endless capacity for helping others--it truly does feel good. 
   Added to all of their other accomplishments, David just finished an extraordinary tour as U.S. Ambassador to Norway. He and Doreen made a very positive impact on our relations with this great ally. They played a major role in arranging for a United States Presidential visit, the first in a long time, and when my wife Barbara and I visited Norway, it was obvious from everyone we met that our country could not have selected a greater representative and symbol of what we stand for. 
   David and Doreen Hermelin's commitment to helping others is truly worthy of recognition, not only by Hillel Day School of Metropolitan Detroit but also by all of us. I know my colleagues will join me in offering them congratulations on this special occasion and a heartfelt thank you for all that they have done.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Americans are fed up with the intolerable levels of gun violence in this country. This violence has seeped into our homes, schools, churches and community centers. 
   In cities and counties across the nation, people are calling for common-sense gun legislation. Mayor John Logie, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, dedicated his State of the City speech to the issue of gun violence and its traumatic effect on children. He asks us to take a new and different approach to the problem, an approach focused on protecting our children. Mayor Logie suggests that there is ``no greater cause behind which we can all join, than saving the lives of our young people.'' Major Logie is right: gun violence can be reduced. I hope this Congress can endorse his message and work to protect our children from senseless firearm injury and death.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the proposed constitutional amendment. 
   The American flag is the premier icon of our national freedom. It is an irreplaceable reminder of liberty, sacrifice, and patriotism. To deliberately desecrate or burn a flag is an insult to anyone who has fought to defend it. But to deliberately weaken the First Amendment rights of all Americans cannot be the answer to those who attack a symbol of freedom. 
   We love our flag for obvious reasons, and true Americans treat it with respect. A person who destroys such an important symbol should face the scorn of all decent women and men. But we should not allow the misguided actions of a few individuals to jeopardize the rights and freedoms of all Americans. 
   The Supreme Court has ruled that such an attack on the flag is a protected form of speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
   If we pass this amendment, and the States ratify it, we alter the Bill of Rights for the first time in our nation's history. For more than 210 years, the Bill of Rights--which protects our most basic freedoms--has served us well. Although I love the flag, I also love the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. When we pledge allegiance to the flag, in the same breath, we pledge allegiance to the Republic for which it stands. 
   Mr. President, Senator John Glenn, a true American hero, reflected these concerns in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. He said:  
   [I]t would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, watered-down version that alters its protections. 
   The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most revered symbol. But is it a symbol. It symbolizes the freedoms we have in this country, but it is not the freedoms themselves.  
   General Colin Powell has said:  
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   We should not alter the basic charter of our liberties just to address the few incidences of flag burning in this country. Despite the attention it receives, flag burning is relatively infrequent. According to one expert, there have been only 200 reported incidences of flag burning in the history of our nation. That amounts to less than one case per year. The 
   Congressional Research Service has listed 43 flag incidents between January 1995 and January 1999. 
   Even if this constitutional amendment were adopted, and the physical desecration of the flag were prohibited, it would not necessarily yield the intended results: the preservation of our glorious symbol. 
   As the Port Huron Times Herald suggested on June 26, 1999, flag desecration may not necessarily be flag burning, but the trivialization of the flag:  
   How glorifying is it to see the Stars and Stripes emblazoned on paper napkins destined to be smeared with ketchup and barbecue sauce and tossed in a trash can? 
   How respectful is it to wrap ourselves in Old Glory beach towels? Sip our coffee from red, white and blue mugs? Start our car from a flag-emblazoned key chain? 
   We shouldn't worry about people burning the flag. It just doesn't happen. We should worry about trivializing a glorious symbol into something as meaningless as a paper napkin.  
   I oppose the proposed constitutional amendment because it would amend our Bill of Rights for the first time, but I do support a statutory prohibition on flag desecration. The McConnell-Conrad-Dorgan statutory approach is preferable because it provides protection of the flag through enactment of a statute, and subsequently, does not weaken our First Amendment freedoms. 
   If we love the flag, we will not only preserve the sanctity of the cloth, but the freedoms for which it stands. No matter how abhorrent the action of flag burning may be, I see great danger in amending the Bill of Rights and curtailing freedoms enumerated in the Constitution, the very documents that give our flag its meaning.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Calvin College Knights on their recent athletic success. On Saturday, March 18, 2000, Calvin College's Men Basketball team completed their ``storybook'' season by winning the Division III Men's National Championship. The National Championship is the Men's second since 1992 and the third for Calvin College in the last two years. The Calvin Women's Cross Country team captured the National Title in 1998 and 1999. 
   With only two seniors on their roster, the young Knights opened the season by winning the Lee Pfund Classic in Wheaton, Illinois. After the tournament, Calvin began play in the competitive Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the nation's oldest athletic conference, where they compiled a perfect 17-0 record. Included in this total were two thrilling victories over arch-rival Hope College. For the uninitiated, this intrastate rivalry has the ability to make or break either school's season. Sports Illustrated has noted that the rivalry between these ``two Division III schools in Western Michigan, is the equal of Duke-North Carolina, Georgetown-Syracuse or any of the big Division I rivalries,'' and Tim Russert announced the outcome on ``Meet the Press'' this year. 
   The drama and success of the regular season served as a prelude to the NCAA Tournament. Calvin's first tournament game was an overtime cliff-hanger against Franklin in which Nate Burgess, of Grand Rapids, MI, tipped in the winning basket with 3.6 seconds left. This basket allowed Calvin to advance to the ``Sweet 16'' for the first time since 1993. After two lopsided victories, Calvin relied on the last minute of heroics of Bryan Foltice, of Grandville, MI, who hit a running jumper as time expired to propel Calvin into the National Championship game. 
   The Championship game against the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire featured a torrid first half, clutch plays in the waning minutes and a well-balanced attack in which five Knights scored in double figures. With this 79-74 victory, Calvin concluded the season with a 22-game winning streak, and became only the sixth Division III school to have won two national championships. 
   The season became even sweeter when Jeremy Veenstra, of Kalamazoo, MI, and Aaron Winkle, of Lake City, MI, were named to the Final Four All-Tournament team. In addition, Winkle was both an All-American and Academic All-American. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Calvin College for their extraordinary individual achievements and their National Championship. Go Knights!

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week we remember another tragedy in America's history, the 2-year anniversary of the school shooting in Jonesboro, AR. Two years ago this Friday, the Nation watched two boys, ages 11 and 13, open fire on their classmates, killing four young people and a teacher. 
   At the time the school shooting in Jonesboro had the distinction of being one of the Nation's bloodiest. We were stunned that two boys so young had so much anger in them, anger that was made deadly by access to more than a half a dozen guns and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. In 1998, the pastor of a church attended by one of the four children shot to death in Jonesboro said:  
   Nothing touches us more than when our children are hurt. There's never been anything you could possibly compare this to.  
   He didn't know that over the next 2 years there would be school shootings in Georgia, Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and recently in my own home State of Michigan. 
   Sadly, these tragedies have not convinced Congress to act to try to take guns out of the hands of children. In the aftermath of Columbine, almost a year ago, the Senate passed a juvenile justice bill with moderate gun safety amendments designed to reduce juvenile access to guns. That bill has been stuck in conference committee for months, and legislative proposals to prevent juvenile access to guns has been stymied by this Congress. 
   Americans cannot understand why Congress has done nothing to prevent the tide of shootings in our schools and public places. Americans do not believe the National Rifle Association's rhetoric--the argument that guns don't kill people, people kill people. They are absolutely and utterly appalled by the most recent statement of the NRA that the President is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda.'' 
   I believe the NRA owes an apology to the American people for those incendiary comments by Wayne LaPierre, its executive vice president. His words represent the lowest level of personal attack that has been hurled against any President that I can remember. They cross the line of acceptable political debate. There should be an outpouring of revulsion, not just from persons who disagree with policies supported by the NRA but from the NRA's own members and from those who agree with its positions. 
   Americans may be divided on the need to pass gun-related legislation but are surely united when it comes to protecting the lives of our fellow citizens and our children. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a week ago, Veronica McQueen didn't have the slightest idea she would be the latest parent thrust into a tragic spotlight. Now, the mother of Kayla Rolland, the six-year-old girl who was shot and killed in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is very much the focus of public attention and empathy. 
   Kayla's mother and parents across the country are heartsick. Parents too often fear sending their children to school in the morning. They are joining the fight against gun violence and demanding that Congress make this country safer for their own children and the nation's children. As Kayla's mother said, ``I just don't want to see another parent have to bury another baby over this, over something that is preventable, something that is very, very preventable.'' 
   I would like to share some of the thoughts and feelings of mothers across the country. They have written to the Million Mom March, an organization fighting for commonsense gun legislation, asking Congress to listen to their pleas for safety. I urge Congress to stop listening to the NRA and heed the words of parents: pass legislation before more children's voices are silenced by gunshots. 
   Victoria of Pittsburgh, PA writes: ``It is 4 a.m. and my daughter had that terrifying dream again--the one about the man with the gun--`he'd already shot you and Dad, Mom--and now he's coming for me.' Was my daughter affected by Columbine? I was!'' 
   Cindy of Bridgewater, NJ: ``Our children look to their parents for protection. What are we suppose to tell them when we can't? Who are we suppose to go to for help? It is the job of EVERY citizen in this country and EVERY  government official to make sure our children are safe. Stricter gun laws are only meant to do ONE thing. ..... PROTECT OUR CHILDREN! I am asking the government to please step up to the plate and protect them ..... after all aren't some of you parents too?'' 
   Julie of Hamilton, VA: ``I want to protect my two remaining children and grandchild from the horror of gun violence. I was not able to protect my precious son Jesse, who was a victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on June 11, 1999.'' 
   Leslie of Philadelphia, PA: ``On February 2 ,2000, my son, Songha Thomas Willis, was fatally shot in a holdup while visiting me in Philadelphia ..... Needless to say, this has been a very difficult time for me and my family over the past few weeks. We are still in shock, and as a family of law enforcers, we are doubly affected by this event ..... I support not only changing gun control laws but changing the hearts of those who are against our efforts, because the heart is the fountainhead of all things moral.'' 
   Deborah of Walled Lake, MI: ``..... A few months ago someone I love lost a child to violence and a hand gun. His son who had just turned 17 a few weeks before was shot sitting on his own front porch. Someone thought he was someone else and walked up to him and ended his life his dreams his families dreams for him in an instant. He is gone and the world is a sadder place because of that loss. We have to stop this senseless killing the loss of our children. Our best chance of making Washington listen to us is if our voices are one. I will be with those who march in Washington on Mothers day. We have to stop the killing of our children.'' 
   B. Adams of Littleton, CO: ``My daughter survived Columbine, but looking into the faces of the parents that night who had not found their children was the hardest thing I've ever done. Although guns were not the only equation, how can we not do what we can to prevent this from happening again?! How can gun commerce be more important than the lives and safety of our children? How can we face them and not say that we have done all we can to protect them?'' 
   Eileen of Palm Beach Gardens, FL: ``My 19 yr. old son Michael was murdered on March 21, 1996 along with his best friend. Both were shot in the head execution style by two teens who had been involved in an attempted murder 13 hours before using a hand gun. These last four years have been a living hell and if I can stop just one mother from living the nightmare I have had to live, then I will be happy.'' 
   Suzy of Raleigh, NC: ``Last April, my growing lanky 10 yr. old sat on my lap the day after Columbine and asked me--`Why?' I had no answer. I simply held him and cried with him. I still have no answer. But I don't ever want him to ask me why I didn't do something. I will link hands with all of you on Mothers Day. Its time to take back our precious babies' childhoods.'' 
   Lori of Troy, MI: ``I am scared and outraged for our children. In Michigan there is an effort to allow concealed weapons. I have had enough of the NRA and the pro gun lobby. They say the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. I hope we can change it.'' 
   Angelique of Imperial Beach, CA: ``A close friend of mine once found a little boy that had been accidentally shot in the head by a friends' dads' gun. To this day she will never in a million years forget what it felt like to have that little boy tug and pull at her shirt during his last few moments alive. Had there been a trigger-lock on that firearm his life could've been saved ..... As well as so many others .....''

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Senator MIKULSKI in introducing the National Digital Empowerment Act, which seeks to close the gap between those who have technology available to them and those who do not. I commend Senator MIKULSKI for her commitment to connect every school and community to the Information Superhighway. The legislation we are introducing will help to achieve this goal. It will enable students and teachers in all communities to have access to computers, as well as the training that is necessary to use this technology effectively.  
   The widening digital divide falls heaviest on those who can least afford to be left behind. Recent studies show that the Digital divide for the poorest Americans has grown by 29 percent since 1997, and that over 50 percent of schools lack the infrastructure needed to support new technology. In addition, approximately 4 out of 10 teachers report that they have had no training in using the Internet; and a mere 10 percent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent of all public schools reported that technology-related training for teachers was mandated by the school, district, or teacher certification agencies. This legislation will provide the necessary tools to reverse this trend. 
   It will substantially increase funding for teacher training in technology, including the creation of Teacher Technology Preparation Academies--teachers who are trained by the Academies would be encouraged to return to their schools and act as technology instructors for other teachers; increase funding for school technology; extend the current enhanced deduction for computer technology which is currently due to expire in 2001; require HUD to establish e-Villages in all HUD housing programs; authorize and increase funding for the creation of Community Technology Centers and e-corps within the AmeriCorps; create a one stop shop clearinghouse of public and private technology efforts within the U.S. Department of Education to be headed by an Assistant Secretary for Technology Education. In addition, the legislation directs the Secretary to implement an Internet-based, one-to-one pilot project that specifically targets the educational needs of K-12 students in low-income school districts, including hardware, software and ongoing support and professional development; and improve the e-Rate program. 
   After two funding cycles the total e-Rate funding that went to our nation's schools and libraries was $3.6 billion nationally, including $137.15 million for Michigan. That is a good investment to help prepare our children and citizens for the information age of the 21st century. But it is still not sufficient to provide all qualified schools and libraries with the e-Rate discounts they have requested. This legislation would improve the Universal Service Fund by making the e-Rate application process simpler, and would increase the current cap of $2.25 billion and expand eligibility to include structured after school programs, Head Start centers and programs receiving federal job training funds. The e-Rate has proven itself to be a successful and popular program and its time to make it available to everyone who needs it. 
   I am especially pleased to be a part of this legislative effort because it supports some model initiatives that I have established in my home state of Michigan, to create ways in which teachers can become more computer literate and able to integrate technology into the curriculum and to bring technology into every classroom. 
   About 2 years ago, I convened an education technology summit that brought together over 400 business leaders, school administrators, school board members, foundation representatives, deans of Michigan's colleges of education and others to identify ways in which Michigan could excel in the area of Education technology. What I learned was that one of the biggest obstacles to technologically up-do-date classrooms is the lack of training of our teachers in the use of technology. If teachers don't understand how to integrate computers, the Internet, and other technology into the instructional program, students won't get full advantage of these innovations, no matter how much hardware and wiring have been installed. 
   Despite impressive achievements in the utilization of education technology in a few localities, Michigan as a whole was below the national average in every measure of the use of technology in our schools. It ranked 44 in teacher training in the use of technology; and 10 percent of teachers reported that they had less than 9 hours of technology training. In addition, Michigan ranked 32 among the states in the ratio of students per computer. I have subsequently hosted a number of working sessions which have resulted in a specific plan of action to advance education technology in Michigan. 
   Some key elements of the plan of action include the formation of a consortium that will establish the nation's highest standards for training new teachers to use technology in the classroom. Beginning with the 1999-2000 academic year, the Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching with Technology {COATT} will award certificates of recognition to new teachers who have demonstrated an exceptional ability to use information technology as a teaching tool. 
   COATT membership includes an impressive slate of higher educational institutions from Michigan: Albion College, Andrews University, Eastern Michigan University, Ferris State University, Lake Superior State University, Michigan State University, Oakland University, University of Detroit-Mercy, University of Michigan, University of Michigan-Dearborn, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University. Neither the education nor the certificate is mandatory. However, new teachers with certificates will have an advantage in the job market and school districts will benefit by knowing which applicants are qualified in using technology effectively in their instruction. The letter of agreement signed by each COATT member in committing their institution to provide the resources to achieve the success of the COATT initiative which is included at the end of my remarks. 
   Michigan is already recognized as a leader in producing new teachers and if we set our minds to it, I'm convinced we can be the best in the nation when it comes to teaching teachers how to integrate technology in the classroom. 
   Another key element of my plan of action to advance Michigan's standing in education technology is the establishment of the Teach for Tomorrow Project, TFT, an online delivery system for educational technology training and credentialing of in-service teachers. By using technology to teach the technology, lessons can be accessed statewide and at time and location which are convenient to the learners. An added bonus, which results in an expansion of the use of technology in the classroom, is that teachers who complete TFT teach other teachers what they have learned. Central Michigan University has approved the use of TFT materials as a professional development course eligible for 3 graduate credit hours when done in conjunction with local onsite training. 
   The legislation before us, the National Digital Empowerment Act, will speed the closing of the digital divide not only in my state of Michigan, but nationwide. Time is of the essence. We must act responsibly and we must act now! 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the COATT member agreement signed by higher education institutions in Michigan.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for raising the question of the proliferation of guns and gun violence in our schools as we debate education on the Senate floor. We should not be debating education without addressing the question of the gun violence which strikes so many of our schools. 
   It has now been almost a year since the deadly shooting at Columbine. The images of Columbine's teenagers clinging for life and screaming in terror are forever printed in our minds. Not many of us could forget the horror of those scenes as they unfolded before us on national television. Yet somehow it seems that Congress has forgotten the unforgettable. 
   Now, in yet another school shooting, the tragic, senseless death of another child--this time in my home State of Michigan --has reminded us of the terror of gun violence and the toll it takes on young people. 
   According to a press report, the shooting stunned even gun control advocates immersed in the details of school violence. If a 6-year-old can get a gun, they said, the problem is worse than anyone thought. The first grade shooting that occurred this week in Mount Morris Township near Flint, MI, is surely shocking because of the nature of the circumstances: An alleged 6-year-old gunman living in a house with easy accessibility to guns and little comprehension of the consequences of his actions. No one can really any longer claim shock or surprise that another young life was lost to gun violence. No one can any longer claim shock or surprise that another one of our children did not make it home from school. 
   We have known, long before Columbine, that gun violence claims the lives of 12 children, on average, each day. We know gun violence results in injury and death, destroys families, and causes lasting psychological and emotional harm. Buell Elementary's counselors will now try to cope with the trauma that comes when schoolchildren shoot schoolchildren. Too many other districts now know that violence and the fear of violence is not only devastating to the children and the families involved, it can also infect the learning environment. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to the tragedies of gun violence. As a Detroit Free Press writer put it:   
   [At Buell] the first-grade classroom, so vibrant with the piping voices of children early Tuesday morning, had been commandeered by police detectives, searching for the meaning behind the unthinkable.  
   Congress must pass gun safety legislation before more children's voices are silenced by the sounds of gunfire and sirens.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against the so-called Affordable Education Act, S. 1134, because it is not a wise use of Federal dollars. It does not address our national education priorities. And, it will not help those who are most in need. 
   I would like to take a moment to talk about exactly who will benefit from this IRA expansion for elementary and secondary education expenses. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 70 percent of the proposed IRA tax benefit would go to the top 20 percent of all taxpayers. These higher income families, many of whom already send their children to private schools, would gain most of the benefits. Families unable to save, including most families earning less than $55,000 a year, would receive very little, if any benefit at all. 
   Additionally, this IRA tax benefit would be minimal. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the average annual benefit for families with children attending private schools would be limited to approximately $37; and for families with children in public schools, the average annual benefit would be $7. 
   Mr. President, 90 percent of the children in America attend public schools. Instead of investing in proven initiatives to raise academic standards for all children, the bill before the Senate emphasizes the wrong priority. It fails to reduce class size, enhance teacher training in technology, modernize school buildings, expand after-school programs or improve special education.  
   According to the National Council on Education Statistics, nearly 53 million children are currently enrolled in public schools and the number is expected to increase to 54.3 million by 2008. It is estimated that approximately 2,400 new school facilities will be needed to accommodate this increase. As is well documented, the condition of school facilities and the student-teacher ratio are linked to student achievement. Therefore, it is clear where our federal education resources should be directed. 
   We must not lose sight of the fact that school modernization is a critical component to the success of our school children. It simply must be one of our national educational priorities. Local school communities cannot shoulder all of the costs associated with school building modernization and technology infrastructure improvements. 
   Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that has opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for students to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they must learn how to use new technologies. But all too often, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their instruction without being given the training to do so. 
   Too often students are left to teach teachers in the rapidly expanding area of technology. It is not enough for a teacher to be able to email, they must use this education technology to advance their curriculum and guide their students along the information highway. Just two years ago, it was reported that a mere 10 percent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent of all public schools reported that technology-related training for teachers was mandated by the school, district, or teacher certification agencies. Currently, only 18 states require pre-service technology training. I am disappointed that the legislation before us does not adequately address the large-scale needs of our teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. 
   In my own state of Michigan I often talk with teachers when I visit schools and I find them straight-forward about what they don't know and eager to develop new technology skills. In fact, the only reason that we are not further behind in this area is that teachers have used their own time and often their own money to learn the technology skills to better teach their courses. 
   Almost 2 years ago, I brought together about 400 leaders in education, business, philanthropy and government for a Michigan summit meeting focusing on the need for a greater commitment to professional development in technology. My message at that gathering and my message now is that we've got to match our teacher's commitment to our children with our own commitment to their professional development in the use of technology in classroom instruction. I am currently involved with several initiatives that are an attempt to accomplish this. 
   Mr. President, for all these reasons, I cannot support this legislation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am saddened to come to the floor this afternoon to speak about a tragedy that occurred yesterday in my home State of Michigan. 
   Yesterday morning, in room No. 6 at Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris Township near Flint, a first-grade student allegedly shot and killed his young classmate, Kayla Rolland. 
   We don't yet know all the facts about how the first-grader gained access to the handgun or whether the shooting was accidental or intentional. We do know, however, that one girl lost her young life in this tragedy and the children at Buell Elementary are scared  and confused and their parents deeply concerned. 
   Although grief counselors and social workers are at the elementary school now and will work their hardest to help these children understand and cope with the trauma, there is really no amount of counseling that can replace the innocence these children have lost. 
   The class of 22 students who witnessed the shooting is looking for answers and so are most of the rest of us. How can we make sense of this tragedy and the apparent relative ease with which a 6-year-old brought a 32-caliber semiautomatic handgun to school? 
   It is impossible to come to terms with this or any of the other shooting tragedies in this country that claim the lives of 12 children on the average each day. Yet always after a tragedy such as this one, we ask ourselves if it could have been prevented. The answer is a resounding yes. Congress can and must work to keep guns out of the hands of children. 
   It has now been almost 1 year since the deadly shooting at Columbine and still Congress has done nothing to help prevent these school shootings. 
   Lori Mizzi-Spillane, a Michigan coordinator of the Million Mom March, an organization advocating for stricter Federal firearms laws, asks in her words, ``What is it going to take now for people to wake up?'' 
   What will it take for us to ``wake up'' and pass legislation requiring firearms to be sold or transferred with storage or safety devices? What will it take for us to ``wake up'' and pass child access prevention legislation which would require that adults store firearms safely and securely in places that are reasonably inaccessible to children? Together, both Houses must enact these and other commonsense gun safety reforms that will keep our young people alive. 
   We should also note that the semiautomatic handgun that was reportedly used by the 6-year-old is a Saturday-night special, or junk gun, manufactured by one of the same companies that recently filed for bankruptcy protection to evade claims for damages caused by their product. 
   Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act to prevent gun manufacturers from tactically using bankruptcy laws to evade accountability. That amendment would have held those companies responsible if they produced unsafe products and distributed those products negligently. The amendment did not pass, and the gun industry continues to be the only industry explicitly exempted from Federal health and safety regulations. As a result, many of the guns manufactured today lack even the most basic kind of safety devices. We should repeal this privileged position of gun manufacturers and also require that all firearms are personalized or child-proofed so they cannot be fired by unauthorized users. 
   I extend my thoughts and my prayers to Kayla's family, and I know I do on behalf of every Member of the Senate. No family should have to suffer what this family has suffered in the last 2 days and what they will continue to suffer as long as they live. We will work ever harder to reduce the toll of gun violence for all the children of America. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every February nationwide we celebrate African American History Month. We do so because in 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as a way of preserving the history of the Negro and recognizing the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, faith and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the betterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity towards them. Throughout the Nation, we celebrate the many important contributions African Americans have made in all facets of American life. 
   Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer recently reflected on the life and times of Dr. Woodson. In an article he wrote earlier this month for Johnson's Publications, Bennett tells us that one of the most inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West Virginia to the summit of academic achievement:  
   At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.   
   Mr. President, in keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I would like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home state of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American injustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who would change the course of history. 
   Mr. President, Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights movement are indelibly echoed in the chronicle of not only the history of this Nation, but are viewed with distinction and admiration throughout the world. 
   Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one of the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the inhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the abolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of equality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, Michigan on September 25, 1999. I commend Dr. Velma Laws-Clay who headed the Monument Steering Committee and Sculptor Tina Allen for making their dream, a true monument to Sojourner Truth, a reality. 
   Mr. President, Sojourner Truth had an extraordinary life. She was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, served as a slave under several different masters, and was eventually freed in 1828 when New York state outlawed slavery. She continued to live in New York and became strongly involved in religion. In 1843, Baumfree, in response to a command from God, changed her name to Sojourner Truth and dedicated her life to traveling and lecturing. She began her migration West in 1850, where she shared the stage with other abolitionist leaders such as Frederick Douglass. 
   In 1851, Sojourner Truth delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' speech at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. In the speech, Truth attacked both racism and sexism. Truth made her case for equality in plain-spoken English when she said,  
   Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, cause Christ wasn't a woman? Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.  
   By the mid-1850s, Truth had settled in Battle Creek, Michigan. She continued to travel and speak out for equality. During the Civil War, Truth traveled throughout Michigan, gathering food and clothing for Negro volunteer regiments. Truth's travels during the war eventually led her to a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, at which she presented her ideas on assisting freed slaves. Truth remained in Washington, D.C. for several years, helping slaves who had fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. Due to bad health, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there until her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions is that her words continue to speak to us today. 
   Mr. President, on May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which authorized the President of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. The Congressional Gold Medal was presented to Rosa Parks on June 15, 1999 during an elaborate ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. I was pleased to cosponsor this fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and respect by us all. 
   Forty four years ago in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American people but the entire world. 
   My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our own. Rosa Parks and her husband made the journey to Michigan in 1957. Unceasing threats on their lives and persistent harassment by phone prompted the move to Detroit where Rosa Parks's brother resided. 
   Rosa Parks' arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day in 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and justice. For instance, twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's bus related segregation laws, which required African Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus then get off of the bus and re-board from the rear of the bus. The driver of that bus was the same driver with whom Rosa Parks would have her confrontation 12 years later. 
   The rest is history--the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 
   Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for all. But we still have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle on Civil Rights and to human rights.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join our Chairman, Senator WARNER, in congratulating and thanking Marie Fabrizio Dickinson on the occasion of her thirtieth anniversary on the staff of the Committee on Armed Services. This is a remarkable milestone for Marie. The Armed Services Committee and the Senate are very fortunate to continue to be the beneficiaries of her tremendous dedication and devotion to duty. In our Committee's history, no other staff member has ever served longer. But this tribute is about much more than the number of her years in service. 
   A native Washingtonian, Marie was initially appointed to the Committee as a clerical assistant by Senator John Stennis in 1970. In 1986, she was named the Committee's Assistant Chief Clerk by Senator Barry Goldwater and in 1999 Senator Warner promoted her to Chief Clerk. Whether managing the myriad of details associated with military construction projects, editing the Committee's SALT II hearing transcripts, or administering the complexities of thousands of military and civilian nominations, Marie has consistently given her best to our Committee and performed with excellence. 
   One of the true hallmarks of Marie Dickinson's service on the Committee has been her ability to achieve success by working with quiet yet steadfast determination. If you ever need a living reminder of the timeless virtue of letting one work's speak for itself, look no further than Marie Dickinson. Marie has earned the trust and respect of those around her not because of what she has said, but because of what she has been able to accomplish in her loyalty, unselfishness, and attention to detail. 
   Those who know Marie know that throughout her career on the Armed Services Committee she has demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining the traditions of the Committee in general and in preserving the records of our Committee in particular. Many of us would certainly agree with these goals, but very few of us would be able to actually take the steps necessary day-in-and-day-out to safeguard the records that comprise the Committee's history. Marie's Herculean efforts to archive, research, compile and protect our Committee's record will insure that our Committee's important work is chronicled and documented for the historians of the future. 
   Marie Dickinson has dedicated her entire professional career to the work of the Armed Services Committee. It is very fitting that we take time today, on this her thirtieth anniversary, to pay tribute to and thank her for the significant and lasting contributions she has made to our work on the Committee and to the United States Senate. I hope, as I know Senator WARNER does, and all the other Committee Members and the staff do, that Marie will continue to serve with us for many more years.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today in the Detroit Free Press, there is a story about a potential nightmare in Michigan. The article alleges that Kevin Olender, a felon convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon was preparing an attack on his co-workers in Farmington Hills. According to the article, Olender was able to evade background checks required by the Brady law, by purchasing a gun in parts. Allegedly, Olender was only one part away from finishing the construction of his firearm, and that part was expected within days. 
   In the end, investigators prevented any shoot-out, but the article highlights another loophole in federal firearm law that gives felons access to firearms which would otherwise be forbidden. I urge my colleagues to close this loophole and the many others in our federal law.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I had a number of concerns with this bill, as it was approved by the House. I am pleased that we have been able to reach agreement on an amendment that addresses many of these concerns. The managers' amendment would make it clear that the application of sanctions under section 3 of the bill is discretionary, not mandatory. It would also urge the executive branch to provide notice to persons who may be subject to sanctions under this provision, giving them an opportunity to provide explanatory or exculpatory information before such sanctions are provided. 
   I had planned on offering several amendments to this bill when it came to the floor, but because of the adoption of this amendment, I shall not do so. I would also like to clarify a few points with the chief Senate sponsors of the bill. 
   First, the bill requires reporting of foreign persons when there is ``credible information'' indicating that the person transferred specified goods, services, or technologies to Iran. I understand that it is the intent of the sponsors that the President judge the credibility of information on the basis of all information available to him, including both information that supports and information that undermines the conclusion that a covered transfer may have taken places. In other words, ``credible information'' is information that would lead a reasonable person to conlcude--after consideration of all the available evidence--that there is a substantial possibility that a covered transfer took place. Is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. The second point that I would like to address is the use of the word ``timely'' in the managers' amendment. It is my understanding that the intent is that, whenever appropriate, the President provide notice to foreign persons, or to the government with primarily jurisdiction over such persons, in a manner that provides them a reasonable opportunity to provide explanatory or exculpatory information before sanctions are imposed. Do the lead sponsors agree with this view?

   Mr. LEVIN. Finally, I would like to address section 6 of the bill, which requires a determination by the President that, among other things, the Government of Russia has demonstrated a sustained commitment to seek out and prevent the transfer to Iran of goods, services and technology that ``could'' make a material contribution to the development of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or of ballistic or cruise missile systems. It is my understanding that the use of the word ``could'' in this provision is not intended to go beyond other nonproliferation requirements or require the President to consider remote or absurdly hypothetical circumstances. Is that correct?

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Most Reverend Moses B. Anderson, S.S.E. Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit. On February 17, 2000, Bishop Anderson was honored with the Mother Theresa Duchemin Maxis Award in recognition for his many years of dedication and service within the Archdiocese of Detroit. 
   Serving as Michigan's first African American Catholic Bishop, Moses Anderson has ministered to the needs not only of the Catholic Community, but to the Community of Humankind, since his ordination in 1958. For the last 40 years, he has served the Catholic Church with integrity and dedication. In addition, he is the recipient of multiple honorary degrees, an enstooled Chief in Ghana, West Africa, and an internationally revered minister and scholar. Currently serving as pastor at the Church of the Precious Blood in Detroit, his homilies have the distinction of being based in songs portraying the loving relationship between God and humankind. For this reason, Anderson is known as a man of songs as well as an accomplished and beloved clergyman. 
   Bishop Anderson's departure from his vicariate duties makes way for new beginnings in his life. I am confident that his future endeavors will be as successful and fulfilling as the previous ones. For certain, he will remain active in his many church and community activities, but will have more time to dedicate to his favorite hobbies--music, organic gardening, cooking, and being the ``good shepherd'' he is known to be. I am pleased to join his colleagues and friends in offering my thanks for all he has accomplished in making his community a better place. 
   Mr. President, Bishop Moses B. Anderson can take pride in his long career of service and dedication to the Catholic Church. I know my colleagues join me in saluting Bishop Anderson's commitment to his community and religion, and in wishing him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, President Clinton sent to Congress his budget proposal for the 2001 fiscal year. 
   Among his initiatives is a proposal to improve the enforcement of federal firearm laws. Specifically, the President requests more than $280 million to provide law enforcement agencies with tools they need to reduce gun crime. The proposal includes funds to: improve the speed and accuracy of Brady background checks by upgrading State and local criminal history records; hire 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agents and inspectors; provide grants to hire 1,000 new federal, state and local gun prosecutors; implement a comprehensive crime gun tracing program; and support local anti-gun violence media campaigns. 
   I believe this is an important initiative in the fight against gun violence, and I applaud the President's commitment to this issue. I hope that during this Session, Congress will support full funding for this aggressive gun enforcement initiative, and will act to close loopholes in our federal firearm laws that give young people and felons easy access to guns.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
   This amendment, which is cosponsored by a number of our colleagues, provides that gun manufacturers and  distributors cannot evade responsibility for damages that are caused by their reckless or negligent conduct or their fraudulent conduct by seeking reorganization in bankruptcy court. It is that straightforward. We already have about 18 provisions in the bankruptcy law based on public policy which provide that certain kinds of debts are not dischargeable. 
   For instance, we have in the law a provision that says if you drive while drunk and you injure somebody, you cannot discharge that obligation by going bankrupt. Senator Danforth made an eloquent statement on this floor arguing for justification for that particular exception, that nondischargeability, when he said:  
   Today there exists an unconscionable loophole in the bankruptcy statute which makes it possible for drunk drivers who have injured, killed or caused property damage to others to escape civil liability for their actions by having their judgment debt discharged in Federal bankruptcy court. This loophole affords opportunities for scandalous abuse of the judicial process.  
   Following Senator Danforth's and others' pleas that we make liability resulting from drunken driving nondischargeable in bankruptcy, this Congress added another nondischargeable obligation in our bankruptcy law. We have about 18 of those provisions. We have a provision that says if you have an obligation to the Government for a student loan, you are not going to be able to get rid of that by going bankrupt. We have a provision in the bankruptcy law which says if you have an obligation to a co-op or to a condo for a fee you owe to them, under certain circumstances that is not going to be dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
   And what we are saying now in this amendment is that where a gun manufacturer or a distributor, through his own reckless, negligent, or fraudulent conduct causes damages to individuals or our communities, they should not be able to reorganize in bankruptcy court and get rid of that debt. 
   This is the public policy purpose beyond this particular provision. It has the support of many organizations such as Handgun Control, which is Sarah Brady's group, has written in support of this amendment, saying:  
   Gun manufacturers, distributors, and dealers should not be able to evade these legitimate claims for damages.  
   In 1996, Lorcin Engineering Company, one of the chief manufacturers of Saturday night specials, or junk guns, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Other gun manufacturers such as Davis Industries and Sundance Industries have followed Lorcin's lead and have filed for bankruptcy to avoid liability. We must not allow other companies to take advantage of this bankruptcy system. 
   We have an unusual provision in the law that exempts the gun industry from safety and health regulation. It is the only industry that is explicitly exempt from health and safety regulations and from the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. No agency has safety oversight over manufacturers who have produced unsafe firearms, and so litigation serves as the only mechanism that can hold the industry responsible. 
   What this amendment says is that where there is damage caused by fraud or reckless or negligent conduct of a manufacturer or distributor, that manufacturer or distributor should not be able to reorganize itself out of accountability, away from responsibility by going to bankruptcy court. The public policy purpose behind this amendment is a powerful one, indeed. 
   In addition to Sarah Brady's organization, which I have mentioned, the National League of Cities supports this amendment. They have written a letter dated November 16:  
   Like debts incurred by drunk driving, Congress must send a clear and convincing message that it will not permit debtors to escape debts incurred by improper conduct. It is crucial that the Federal Government do all that it can to help local law enforcement effectively address gun violence with commonsense legislation that curtails access to firearms, including altering the bankruptcy code.  
   Too many of these companies have already said they are going to try to reorganize to escape liability. It is a tactic they are using. That is not what the bankruptcy law is all about. The bankruptcy law is not intended to provide that kind of a haven for companies that have engaged in reckless conduct or negligent conduct, to evade responsibility for their obligations. 
   Now, the reasons the National League of Cities has taken this position are many, but one of them is that 30 cities and counties have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers or distributors alleging reckless, negligent, or fraudulent conduct on the part of those manufacturers or distributors. New Orleans, LA; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; Atlanta, GA; Cleveland and Cincinnati, OH; Detroit, MI; San Francisco, CA; St. Louis, MO; and other cities and communities have filed lawsuits alleging reckless conduct, negligent conduct, or fraudulent conduct on the part of a gun manufacturer or distributor. They very strongly support this amendment, as does the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Violence Policy Center. 
   The Violence Policy Center issued a statement saying that this amendment is necessary to ensure that firearm manufacturers, which are exempt from Federal health and safety regulation--and I emphasize the only group that is exempt from Federal health and safety regulation explicitly is the firearms manufacturers. They have gotten that exemption. Yet when it comes to trying to close a loophole in the bankruptcy law, which they are using tactically to evade responsibility, they claim they are being singled out. Indeed, they have singled themselves out in gaining exemption from Federal health and safety regulation, and the only way in which they can be held accountable is through the civil justice system. That is why the Violence Policy Center has written a letter of support, indicating that lack of health and safety regulation means the civil justice system is the only mechanism available to regulate the conduct of gun manufacturers. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is in response to a tactic that has now been declared by a number of gun manufacturers, that when faced with allegations or judgments based on damages caused by reckless or negligent misconduct, they will seek protection through reorganization in the bankruptcy courts. We are trying to reduce the level of gun violence in this country, and one way to do it, a way to support the cities and the mayors and the individuals who have been victimized by reckless or negligent manufacture or distribution, is to close a loophole in the bankruptcy system which a number of gun manufacturers have explicitly said they will use tactically to try to evade responsibility for their misconduct. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my amendment very simply provides that gun manufacturers or distributors cannot evade responsibility for damages which are caused by their reckless or negligent conduct or their fraudulent conduct by reorganizing in bankruptcy. 
   The question has been raised, why single out one industry? The answer is, there are 18 exemptions in the bankruptcy law. We have singled out 18 different instances where public policy is such that we have decided people should not be able to discharge their debts. For instance, students who take out student loans cannot discharge their obligations in bankruptcy. So where public policy indicates we should say something is not dischargeable, we have done that on 18 different occasions. 
   This amendment is strongly supported by the League of Cities and by the Conference of Mayors. About 30 cities have initiated lawsuits, cities from all parts of the country: New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and San Francisco being among them. 
   This is a response to a tactic which is being used by a number of gun manufacturers that are being sued for reckless or negligent or fraudulent conduct, saying: No, we are going to hold you accountable. You cannot reorganize  yourself in bankruptcy out of accountability and responsibility for the damages that have been caused by your own reckless or negligent conduct. 
   I hope this amendment will pass. It has the support of the Violence Policy Center which points out that the gun industry is the only industry that is exempt from Federal health and safety regulations. There is no other industry explicitly exempt except for firearms manufacturers. Insisting they not be able to escape liability for their own reckless or negligent conduct is certainly in keeping with the exemption they sought from Federal health and safety regulations since judicial liability is the only way in which they can be held accountable.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the 105th Congress, the Senate passed a meaningful bankruptcy reform bill by an almost unanimous vote. I voted for that bill because I thought it was a well-balanced reform bill that would discourage abuse of the system and provide enhanced protections and reasonable information to consumers. The final version of that bill was not approved in the 105th Congress, and so, once again, we engaged in debate over how to restructure the nation's bankruptcy laws. When we started debate on this bill, it was substantially different from the moderate, bi-partisan bill of last Congress. I was particularly concerned with the provisions relative to the means-test and consumer credit card disclosures. However, over the course of this debate, the Senate has adopted more than 40 amendments, making this a more reasonable approach to bankruptcy reform. 
   As reported out of the Judiciary Committee, the bankruptcy reform bill did not include consumer protections providing reasonable disclosures of unsecured credit such as credit cards. Studies show that bankruptcy filings increase as household debt increases. High debt-to-income ratios makes working Americans more vulnerable to financial emergencies. I am pleased that the Senate accepted an amendment to provide enhanced access to consumer credit information. Creditors will be responsible for warning debtors about potential dangers of paying only minimum monthly payments and will make a toll free number available to the debtor for more specific information. Although this is not as helpful as the Senate's 1998 bill, it is a step in the right direction. The previous bankruptcy bill gave specific information to consumers about the months and years it would take for consumers to pay off their debts by paying the minimum payment and provided them with their total costs in interest and principle. A more detailed disclosure regarding minimum monthly payments will help families exercise personal responsibility and limit financial vulnerability. 
   In addition, the Senate has made modest steps relative to the bankruptcy bill's means-test. The purpose of a means-test is to prevent consumers, who can afford to repay some of their debts, from abusing the system by filing for Chapter 7. Directing so-called abusive debtors away from Chapter 7, where debts are forgiven, and into Chapter 13, where the debtor must enter into a debt repayment plan, makes sense. But an inflexible means test, with virtually no exceptions, will, in the words of HENRY HYDE, ``deprive debtors and their families of the means to pay for their basic needs.'' I hope that in conference, the Senate-House conferees will work toward establishing a more flexible means-test, one that makes allowances for basic expenses such as transportation, food and rent. 
   I am pleased that two amendments I sponsored, a credit card redlining study and the prohibition of retroactive interest charges, were accepted by the Senate. The redlining amendment requires the Federal Reserve to conduct a study and report to the Banking committee about whether financial institutions use place of residence as a factor in determining credit worthiness. It is an important study that will bring to light the problem of unequal credit opportunity. 
   My other amendment seeks to clarify what credit card companies refer to as a ``grace 
   period.'' Credit card lenders use complicated definitions to explain that ``grace periods'' only apply if the balance is paid in full. For example, assume that a consumer charges an average of $1000 each month and always repays in full on time. If one month, due to an error he writes a check that is $10 less than the full amount he owes, but which is paid on time and is within the ``grace period,'' he probably would expect to pay the $10 charge and the interest on the $10 unpaid balance. However, he is really charged retroactively on the full $1,000 balance to the date the charges were made, even though he had paid 99% of the balance. This consumer's $10 error ends up costing him up to four times that in interest charges. 
   Current practice by these companies undermines reasonable consumer expectations about what how a grace period for their payment works and results in monetary penalties from the application of interest charges. This amendment makes clear that the definition of a grace period is one where a consumer is extended credit. No finance charge can be imposed on the amount paid before the end of the ``grace period.'' 
   I have decided to support this bill. However, I am very concerned by the inclusion of non-germane tax provisions which spend $76 billion of the projected non-Social Security surplus over the next ten years. While some of the provisions included in this package make sense, it is premature and unwise for the Congress to begin spending a surplus which is uncertain before we have begun to pay down the national debt and assured that our priorities in protecting Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and considering other types of tax cuts have been met. For that reason, should this legislation come back from conference with some of these tax provisions or without the modest amendments we adopted in the Senate, I will consider opposing the bill at that time.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Our amendment would change the bankruptcy code so that a firearm manufacturer or distributor who is found liable or may be found liable for negligence or reckless action cannot escape accountability by filing for reorganization in bankruptcy. 
   Our amendment has the endorsement of the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Handgun Control, Inc., which is Sarah Brady's organization, and the Violence Policy Center. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators DURBIN, WYDEN, KENNEDY, FEINSTEIN, LAUTENBERG, and SCHUMER, and I thank them for their persistence and their hard work on this important issue. 
   Under the current bankruptcy code, firearm manufacturers are able to ``take advantage of the system.'' Those are not my words. Those are the words of Lorcin Engineering Company, a manufacturer of cheap, semiautomatic handguns. Lorcin told Firearms Business, an industry publication, that it was ``taking advantage of the system'' by filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996. At the time, Lorcin was one of the chief producers of Saturday night specials or junk guns. Their semiautomatic pistol was number two on the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms list of guns traced to crimes. Some of their cheaply constructed guns were made so poorly they did not meet basic safety requirements to be eligible even for importation. 
   Lorcin sought to evade responsibility for the damages caused by their negligence by filing for chapter 11. Other manufacturers are following their lead, seeking to evade accountability for their wrongdoing by filing in bankruptcy court. For instance, Davis Industries, another producer of poorly constructed semiautomatic firearms, has also sought refuge in bankruptcy court. The New York Times reported on June 24, 1999, that a spokesman for Davis Industries said, ``I'm sure other companies will do the same thing.'' 
   On July 19, 1999, at a creditors meeting for Davis Industries, the owner was asked a few questions by the bankruptcy trustee about his chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.  
   Question: Now, the reasons for filing sounded to me like you're getting sued by all the municipalities in the United States. Is that pretty close to correct? 
   Answer: I think you hit the button on the nose.  
   Lorcin Engineering and Davis Industries found a loophole in our Federal bankruptcy law and the list of these companies grew and is still growing. 
   When the bankruptcy code was enacted, its primary goal was debtor rehabilitation, to provide a fresh start to ``honest but unfortunate debtors'' through the discharge of debts. The code gives debtors the opportunity to shed indebtedness, but there are exceptions. These exceptions to the discharge of a debtor's liability were based on public policy or wrongful conduct of the debtor. Currently, the bankruptcy code defines 18 specific categories of debt that are nondischargeable. These exceptions have been created because of an overriding public purpose. 
   A report issued by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, an independent commission established by Congress to investigate and study issues relating to the bankruptcy code, says this about nondischargeability:  
   Debts excepted from the discharge obtain distinctive treatment for public policy reasons. Many nondischargeable debts involve ``moral turpitude'' or intentional wrongdoing. Other debts are excepted from discharge because of the inherent nature of the obligation, without regard to any culpability of the debtor. Regardless of the debtor's good faith, for example, support obligations and many tax claims remain nondischargeable. Society's interest in excepting those debts from discharge outweighs the debtor's need for a fresh economic start.  
   Among the debts that we exempt from discharge for public policy reasons are debts which arise from death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated, debts incurred by fraud or falsehood, debts incurred by willful and malicious injury, family support obligations, taxes, educational loans, fines, and penalties payable to a governmental entity, et cetera. These exceptions reflect Congress' intent to carve out exceptions to dischargeability for important public 
   interest policy considerations. 
   One category of debt that was added not too long ago to the code ensures that debtors cannot escape debts incurred by a debtor's operation of a  motor vehicle while intoxicated. This change, which was first introduced by Senators Danforth and Pell in the early 1980s, was considered part of an ``all-out attack on drunk driving.'' Congress was persuaded to amend the Federal bankruptcy code with respect to this important policy initiative. At the time, drunk driving accidents killed tens of thousands of Americans and disabled hundreds of thousands of people annually. Senator Danforth argued that drunk driving has caused insurmountable human suffering and economic loss, and in his words:  
   We must assure victims and their families that if they win a civil damage award against the drunk driver, they need not fear that the offender will use Federal law to escape his debt.  
   We should do no less for victims of negligence and recklessness and wrongdoing of gun manufacturers and distributors. 
   Senator Danforth told us:  
   It is a national scandal that 50,000 Americans are smashed and slashed to death on our highways and that 2 million people suffer disabling injuries in car accidents every year.  
   He went on to say:  
   The greatest tragedy is that we have become desensitized to the meaning of these statistics. We have almost come to accept this carnage as the unfortunate price we must pay for the mobility we enjoy. However, if we look behind the mind-numbing statistics--if we ask why so many people are suffering--we will see over half of this bloodshed results from our unwillingness to put a halt to the most frequently committed violent crime in America: drunk driving.  
   The reduction of alcohol-related driving fatalities was an important public policy issue, and by making those debts nondischargeable, Congress acted wisely to protect victims of drunk driving and to deter drunk driving. 
   Congress acted against those endless tragedies and senseless deaths and human suffering by amending the bankruptcy code so a drunk driver could not escape his debt by going bankrupt. Like debts incurred by drunk driving, debts for death or personal injury and costs to communities resulting from the unsafe manufacture or distribution of unsafe firearms and their negligent distribution should also not be dismissed in bankruptcy. The public policy involved here is an overriding one, given the damage caused by the unsafe manufacture and distribution of guns. 
   Senator Danforth's plea to curb drunk driving is very similar to our people's plea to reduce gun violence. Week after week, Americans are lost to the senselessness of gun violence. Year after year, some 30,000 of us are lost to murder or suicide or unintentional shootings and tens of thousands of Americans are treated for firearm injuries. Many of these deaths and injuries are to children. When the carnage results from the unsafe manufacture or distribution of a firearm, we should not allow the manufacturer or distributor to evade the responsibility for its wrongdoing by reorganizing in bankruptcy. 
   Cities around the country and their residents are taking on this problem on their own. Thirty cities and counties have filed lawsuits alleging negligence, wrongdoing, unsafe practices on the part of gun manufacturers or distributors. New Orleans started in October of 1998, followed by Chicago; Miami; Dade County; Bridgeport, CT; Atlanta, GA; Cleveland, OH; Cincinnati, OH; Wayne County, MI; and Detroit, MI; St. Louis, MO; San Francisco, and others. 
   Citizens want the firearm industry to be accountable for unsafe actions on their part. They want firearm manufacturers to be held responsible for poorly constructed and unsafe products. Citizens want firearm manufacturers and distributors to be accountable for wrongful injuries resulting in public outlays for medical care, emergency rescue, and police investigative costs.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and yield myself an additional 3 minutes. 
   One way to deter such misconduct is to say that you cannot avoid that accountability by filing for reorganization in bankruptcy any more than you can evade a judgment for damages resulting from drunk driving. 
   Sound public policy also dictates that the debt incurred by a company's action should not be ducked by a company reorganizing under chapter 11 while the company goes on its merry way and the victims are victimized twice. 
   This amendment does not judge the merits of any lawsuit or the liability of any parties involved in these lawsuits. The amendment simply gives our citizens the assurance that if they win a civil damage award against a firearm manufacturer or distributor, the damages caused by the perpetrator cannot be evaded by being dismissed in bankruptcy court.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are few, if any, who haven't been moved by the triumphant story of Elian Gonzalez, a brave young boy found clinging to a raft on Thanksgiving Day. Elian endured a harrowing journey from Cuba to Florida, after his mother was lost at sea. 
   Now, Elian finds himself in the center of an international tug-of-war. Both sides are entrenched in an emotional debate, that centers more around the Castro regime than it does around the young boy. 
   No matter how hard it may be, for Elian's sake, politics must be taken out of the equation. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has made its ruling, that Elian father's has the authority to speak for his son. His father, Juan Gonzalez, has asked that applications for admission and asylum for Elian be withdrawn. 
   Congress should not ignore the bond between father and child, and the responsibility a father has for his son, regardless of where they reside. 
   People with a legal interest in the matter may test the INS order in Court. Congress should not undermine the Court proceedings, and in the process, possibly trample on the family values we so often claim to honor. 
   Elian's extended relatives in Miami filed their lawsuit in federal court to block the child's return, and any action by Congress to bypass the Court on this matter is inappropriate. The Court will hopefully analyze the facts and decide Elian's future based on his interests, not heated debate or political rigidity. This is an issue that deserves an appropriate forum, one away from politics, where Elian's future can be based on the rules of law that this country has held out to the world.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation's commitment to due process has been placed in doubt by the use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings. 
   Until recently, the Department of Justice's use of secret evidence was not well known to the general public. Secret evidence was known only to some immigrants who have been held for months, sometimes years, without any opportunity to confront their accusers or examine the evidence against them. 
   As the Washington Post of October 19, 1997, put it, the process is authorized by:  
   [A] little-known provision of immigration law in effect since the 1950s allows secret evidence to be introduced in certain immigration proceedings. The classified information, usually from the FBI, is shared with judges, but withheld from the accused and their lawyers.  
   The use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings threatens to violate basic principles of fundamental fairness. The only three Federal courts to review its use in the last decade have all found it unconstitutional. Yet the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the INS, continues to use it and to do so virtually without any limiting regulations. Under current law, the INS takes the position that it can present evidence in camera and ex parte whenever it is classified evidence relevant to an immigrant's application for admission, an application for an immigration benefit, a custody determination, or a removal proceeding. 
   The Attorney General herself has expressed concern over the use of secret evidence--and for good reason. 
   In October 1999, a district court declared the INS' use of secret evidence to detain aliens unconstitutional. Five days later, the INS dropped its efforts to deport a man it had held for over a year and a half on the basis of secret evidence. 
   In November 1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that an Egyptian man detained on secret evidence for 3 and-a-half years should be released, and the Attorney General declined to intervene to continue his detention. 
   Earlier in 1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the BIA, granted permanent resident status to a Palestinian against whom the INS had used secret evidence and alleged national security concerns. 
   In all of these cases the government claimed that national security was at risk, yet in none of them were the individuals even charged with committing any criminal acts. 
   The Attorney General has promised to promulgate regulations to govern the INS's use of secret evidence, but has not yet done so. In May of 1999, the Attorney General came to my state of Michigan to meet with Arab-American leaders and members of the Michigan Congressional delegation to discuss concerns about the use of secret evidence. At that meeting, she said she would implement a new policy, one in which the Department would implement a higher level of review, and take extra precautions before using secret evidence. She said she would have those regulations relative to the use of secret evidence within a reasonable time. 
   In December, the Attorney General visited Michigan again. She had still not promulgated the promised regulations. She told us that she was dedicated to resolving this issue, and she was actively reviewing draft regulations, but that she was uncomfortable issuing those regulations in the form they had been presented to her by her staff. 
   Mr. President, the Attorney General may eventually offer the promised regulations. But at the current time, she is not capable of putting a process in writing that is satisfactory even to her. It has been almost nine months now since the Attorney General agreed to look in to this matter, and promulgate regulations that will govern the use of this process. Under these circumstances, when the Attorney General cannot even satisfy herself that a fair process is in place, the use of this secret process should be suspended until she can, and I urge the Attorney General to do exactly that: suspend the use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings immediately until she can promulgate regulations relative to its use. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Brady law has been very successful. The federal law that requires background checks on deals conducted by federally licensed firearms dealers has prevented more than 470,000 prohibited persons from purchasing firearms. Unfortunately, the Brady law is not the only law enforcement tool needed to prevent felons from purchasing firearms. 
   Straw purchases are probably the best-known way around the Brady law. Straw purchases occur when a buyer with a clean record is hired to purchase a gun for someone who is prohibited by law from buying the gun or does not want to be traced. Often times, this is how gun trafficking is facilitated. Firearms are bought in the legal marketplace, and then transferred directly to the secondary market, where there are virtually no restrictions. 
   A new report issued by Senator SCHUMER shows that most guns used in crimes are purchased in this secondary market. According to the report, which analyzed data compiled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, in 13 percent of crimes, the crime gun could be traced to the original buyer and in 87 percent of the crimes, the gun had transferred hands. 
   Many of the time, these crime guns can be traced back to a small percentage of high volume dealers, who are willing to sell a single person a large quantity of firearms. Guns bought in these large quantities are often characterized by a short ``time to crime,'' or a short period between the sale and time they are used in criminal acts. In another report issued by Senator SCHUMER, a small percentage of licensed dealers are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns. Specifically, in 1998, 137 dealers, or 1.1 percent of all gun dealers, were responsible for selling 13,000 crime guns. 
   Mr. President, I am the cosponsor of a bill that would give ATF the authority it needs to put an end to these practices. The Targeted Gun Dealer Enforcement Act of 1999 focuses in on a specific group of businesses, who have an abysmal record of having their products used for illegal activities. It would outlaw all straw purchasing and give ATF additional law enforcement tools to suspend the licenses of high-volume crime gun dealers. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and help put an end to these unscrupulous practices, which keep violent persons armed.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now approved a long-time crusade of mine--that of speeding the development and delivery of anti-addition medications that block the craving for illicit addictive substances. This is one way in which we can fight and win the war on drugs--by blocking the craving for illegal substances. The proposal, which has now passed the Senate as embodied in S. 324, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, which I introduced in January of this year along with Senator HATCH, Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator BIDEN, will achieve this goal. 
   Mr. President, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, reported out of the Judiciary Committee as Sec. 18 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, enables qualified physicians to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in their offices, under certain strict conditions. There are a number of reasons why this legislation is necessary. The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, requires separate DEA registrations for physicians who want to use approved narcotics in drug abuse treatment and separate approvals of registrants by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by state agencies. The result has been a treatment system consisting primarily of large clinics, preventing physicians from treating patients in an office setting or in rural areas or small towns, thereby denying treatment to thousands in need of it. Additionally, experts say that many heroin addicts who want treatment are often deterred because of the stigma that is associated with such clinics. 
   The medications Buprenorphine and Buprenorphone/naloxone combination have proven to be effective blockers of craving for heroin. Dr. Alan Leshner, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) substantiates this finding in the ``many NIDA funded studies [that] support the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of Buprenorphine and buprenorphine combined with naloxone for the treatment of opiate dependence.'' 
   The intent of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, S. 324, is to make it possible for medications like Buprenorphine, because of the unlikelihood of diversion or abuse, to be used effectively to block the craving for heroin. To do this, the medication must be made available in physician offices and there must be safeguards that such availability is not abused. The protections in the legislation against such abuse are as follows: Physicians may not treat more than 20 patients in an office setting unless the Secretary adjusts this number; the Secretary, as appropriate, may add to these conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated; and the program may be discontinued within three years after the date of enactment, if the Secretary and Attorney General determine that this new type of decentralized treatment has not proven to be an effective form of treatment. 
   States may opt out of the provision. Also, nothing in the waiver policy is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual registration system imposed by current law. In crafting the waiver provisions of this legislation, we consulted with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Federal Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in collaboration with a  private pharmaceutical company developed Buprenorphine for the treatment of heroin addiction. Because of the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to become involved in developing anti-addiction medications, NIDA has played an active role in supporting research at every step of the drug development process. NIDA's Medications Development Division has been working to accelerate the identification, evaluation, development, and approval of new medications to treat drug addiction, which I call anti-addiction drugs. Through this process, NIDA has been able to bring a number of effective medications into drug treatment. In the case of Buprenorphine products, NIDA has supported research for many years which indicates that the medication is effective in blocking the craving for heroin. 
   Mr. President, the crisis of illegal drug use continues to cost society both in human toll and in the loss of billions of dollars each year. Consider the startling and compelling findings of the January 1995 Institute of Medicine Report, which estimates the cost to society for drug abuse and dependence treatment at $66.9 billion in 1990 alone, and estimated the cost of drug-related crime at $46 billion that same year. A 1995 report of the Office of National Drug Control Policy tells us that users of illegal drugs spent $48.7 billion on the purchase of illicit substances to feed their addiction. 
   Recent findings of the Monitoring the Future Program, headed by Dr. Lloyd Johnson of the University of Michigan, indicates that heroin use among American teens doubled between 1991 and 1998, and represents a clear and present danger for a significant number of American young people. Dr. Johnson attributes this to a ``sharp increase in use ..... resulting from adoption of non-injectable modes of administration--smoking and snorting, in particular.'' Dr. Johnson goes on to say that ``the very high purity of heroin on the street has made these new developments possible and that unfortunately, a number of those users will become dependent on heroin and will switch over to injection, which is a more efficient way to derive the equivalent high'' 
   The President of the Michigan Public Health Association, Dr. Stephanie Meyers Schim, has spoken out eloquently about the ``great problems'' of substance abuse. In her recent letter in support of S. 324, she says: Substance abuse affects health care costs, mortality, workers' compensation claims, reduced productivity, crime, suicide, domestic violence, child abuse, and increases costs associated with extra law enforcement, motor vehicle crashes, crime, and lost productivity. Dr. Schim goes on to say, ``Buprenorphine will allow drug addicted individuals to maximize everyday life activities, and participate more fully in work day and family activities while seeking the needed treatment and counseling to become drug free''. 
   Dr. James H. Wood, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Michigan Medical School recently wrote: ``One of the most important aspects of your bill is the use of Buprenorphine by well-trained physicians to treat narcotic addiction from their offices, which has the potential to attract and treat effectively sizable populations of currently untreated addicts ..... a major byproduct of this increased treatment, of course, will be reduction in the demand for illicit narcotics in the U.S.'' 
   Dr. Thomas Kosten, President of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry echoed these sentiments in recent testimony on The Drug Addiction Treatment Act before the House Commerce Committee on Health and Environment, and I quote: ``..... I would like to support the availability of Buprenorphine for office based practice. Addiction is a brain disease and office-based practice is primarily needed for effective treatment of Buprenorphine.'' 
   The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence which is the nation's longest standing organization of scientists addressing drug dependence and drug abuse, have stated that the availability of Buprenorphine in physicians' offices adds a needed expansion of current treatment for heroin addiction. ASAM also cautioned that Buprenorphine will have limited utility if it is tied to the regulatory structure for current treatments of heroin addiction. 
   There are other compelling reasons why we must expedite the delivery of anti-addiction medications. Of the juveniles who land behind bars in state institutions, more than 60 percent of them reported using drugs once a week or more, and over 40 percent reported being under the influence of drugs while committing crimes, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Drug-related incarcerations are up and we are building more jails and prisons to accommodate them--more than 1000 have been built over the past 20 years. According to the July 14, 1999 Office of National Drug Control Policy Update, and I quote: ``Drug-related arrests are up from 1.1 million arrests in 1988 to 1.6 million arrests in 1997--steady increases every year since 1991.'' 
   These sentiments were also expressed during a May 9, 1997 Drug Forum on Anti-addiction Research, which I convened along with Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator BOB KERREY and other members of the Senate. Forum participants, including distinguished experts such as Dr. Herbert Kleber and Dr. Donald Landry of Columbia University, Dr. Charles Schuster of Wayne State University and Dr. James Woods of the University of Michigan, made it crystal clear that time is of the essence--we must act expeditiously on new treatment discoveries that block the craving for illicit addictive substances. 
   Mr. President, I received a very supportive letter from HHS Secretary Donna Shalala: ``I am especially encouraged by the results of published clinical studies of Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial mu opiate receptor agonist, in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act, with unique properties which differentiate it from full agonists such as methadone or LAAM. The pharmacology of the combination tablet consisting of Buprenorphine and naloxone results in ..... low value and low desirability for diversion on the street. Published clinical studies suggest that it has very limited euphorigenic affects, and has the ability to percipitate withdrawal in individuals who are highly dependent upon other opioids. Thus, Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone products are expected to have low diversion potential. Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine naloxone products are expected to reach new groups of opiate addicts--for example, those who do not have access to methadone programs, those who are reluctant to enter methadone treatment programs, and those who are unsuited to them (this would include for example, those in their first year of opiates addiction or those addicted to lower doses of opiates). Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone products should increase the amount of treatment capacity available and expand the range of treatment options that can be used by physicians. Secretary Shalala went on to say, ``Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/Naloxone would not replace methadone. Methadone and LAAM clinics would remain an important part of the treatment continuum.'' 
   Mr. President, a companion bill has been introduced and reported out of Committee in the House. It is my hope that full House will act as expeditiously as the Senate on this important legislation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I start by thanking the Senator from Nebraska for the extraordinary service he has rendered to the Intelligence Committee. I have served with him on that committee for a very short period of time, but I have seen the way he, working with Senator SHELBY, has been able to bring bipartisan leadership to this committee that is so essential for the working of this committee. 
   I say to our colleagues--I know Senator SHELBY has and as I know every member of the committee feels--Senator KERREY has made a unique and extraordinary contribution to the committee. He has attempted to strengthen the intelligence community every step of the way. He has done so in a bipartisan way. I commend him on his service. I know he is being rotated out of the committee, but that is what our rules provide. He will be missed. 
   The conference report to H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act, includes legislation under title 8 entitled ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.'' 
   Title 8 is intended to strengthen the Government's efforts to identify the assets, financial networks, and business associates of major foreign narcotics trafficking groups in an effort to disrupt these criminal organizations and bankrupt their leadership. I think all Senators agree with that laudable goal of combating the insidious effects of drug trafficking. In fact, an earlier version of this legislation was seen as being so without controversy that it was added by the Senate to the intelligence authorization bill in July of this year with little debate and on a voice vote. 
   Senators should be aware, however, that title 8, as it is now written, does have a significant national security, law enforcement, judicial, and drug trafficking implication that belie the legislation's simple design and are somewhat different from the original amendment that was offered, I believe, by Senator COVERDELL and by Senator FEINSTEIN. 
   I am not aware, however, despite the implications of this new language added in conference, of any committee of jurisdiction in either the Senate or the House having held a single hearing on the provision contained in title 8. The Senate Intelligence Committee has not had a hearing on title 8. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not had a hearing. Not a single legal or national security expert inside or outside of Government has testified before a congressional hearing as to whether title 8 should or should not become law, and if it does, how the legal rights of Americans might be changed as a result. 
   Except for the recent and very perfunctory House of Representatives debate and vote on this provision, the only public debate on the complexities of title 8 has occurred in the press. The way the issue has been characterized in press reports erroneously suggest that if you are ready to sign up to title 8 as now set forth after this conference committee in H.R. 1555, then you are being tough on foreign drug traffickers. If, however, you are troubled by the effect that the title 8 language would have on currently existing due process protections afforded innocent Americans, you are described by some in the press as doing the bidding of narcolobbyists. 
   This simplistic characterization is not only false, it is an insult to Members of this body, and it obscures a vitally important civil liberties issue which is at the core of title 8, which is the rights of innocent American citizens to challenge 
   in our courts the taking of their property. 
   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I was a conferee. I did not sign the conference report accompanying the bill because of the contradiction existing between the stated legislative intent of title 8 and the actual language contained in the bill, a contradiction which I attempted but failed in conference to correct by amendment.  
   Specifically, my objection is that title 8, as presently written, would undermine the due process protections now afforded a U.S. citizen or business that has interests or assets blocked under title 8 to challenge the legality of the blocking under the Administrative Procedures Act. 
   This is what the conference report before us says about title 8:  
   There is no intention that this legislation affect Americans who are not knowingly and willfully engaged in international narcotics trafficking, nor is it intended in any way to derogate from existing constitutional and statutory due process protections for those whose assets are blocked or seized pursuant to law.  
   That is the stated intent. That is well and good, and I commend the authors on that intent. The problem is that the words of the bill before us do not, I am afraid, comport with that stated intention. 
   According to the Department of Treasury, which is tasked in title 8 with developing the list of significant foreign narcotics traffickers, due process protections exist in law today for those U.S. citizens to challenge the legality of the blocking of assets in court. 
   On November 8, I wrote a letter to the Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers requesting an opinion on two legal questions concerning title 8. The first question was the following:  
   What existing constitutional and statutory due process protections would allow an American citizen who has an interest blocked by executive branch action to challenge the blocking?  
   Question 2 was:  
   If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how would these existing constitutional and statutory due process protections be changed?  
   In his November 10 reply to me, Richard Newcomb, who is Director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, stated the following with regard to currently existing judicial review of the blocking of American assets:  
   The Administrative Procedures Act, or the APA, provides for judicial review of final agency action.  
   Mr. President, 5 U.S. Code 702 is the citation.  
   In existing sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the final agency action related to blocking are subject to challenge by affected parties through judicial review afforded by the Administrative Procedures Act.  
   Then they go on to say:  
   Because of normal rules of standing and other jurisdictional principles, a U.S. citizen may, in many cases, not be able directly to challenge the blocking of a foreign person's assets pursuant to APA. However----  
   However, and this is the key line----  
   as discussed below, agency review by OFAC, followed by judicial review under APA of any resulting final agency action as to that citizen may still be available. In addition to any statutory review available under the APA, a U.S. citizen may also seek judicial review of constitutional claims or challenges related to blockings under existing OFAC sanctions programs.  
   Under the process that is currently in place, OFAC determines who is a foreign drug kingpin after an internal Department of Treasury review of the evidence and evidentiary review that is coordinated with the Department of Justice. 
   Under Executive Order 12978 issued in 1995, the State Department and Justice Department are required to be consulted by Treasury prior to that designation and prior to the blocking of assets. After designation is made and assets are blocked, OFAC regulations allow for a named party to petition OFAC--

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act, include legislation under Title VIII of the bill entitled the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.'' Title VIII is intended to strengthen U.S. Government efforts to identify the assets, financial networks and business associates of major foreign narcotics trafficking groups in an effort to disrupt these criminal organizations and  bankrupt their leadership. No doubt all Senators would agree with this laudable goal of combating the insidious effects of drug trafficking. In fact, an earlier version of this legislation was seen as being so without controversy that it was added by the Senate to the Intelligence Authorization bill in July of this year with little debate and on a voice vote. 
   Senators should be aware, however, that Title VIII as it is now written has significant national security, law enforcement, judicial, and drug trafficking implications that belie the legislation's simple design. Yet, I am not aware of any committee of jurisdiction in either the Senate or the House having held a single hearing on the provisions contained in Title VIII. The Senate Intelligence Committee has not held a hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not held a hearing. Not a single legal or national security expert, inside or outside government, has testified before a congressional hearing as to whether Title VIII should or should not become law, and, if it does, how would the legal rights of Americans be changed as a result. 
   Except for recent and perfunctory House of Representatives debate on the provision, the only public debate on the complexities of Title VIII has occurred in the press. The way that the issue has been characterized in press reports erroneously suggests that if you are ready to sign up to Title VIII as set forth in H.R. 1555, you are tough on foreign drug traffickers. If, however, you are troubled by the effect that the Title VIII language would have on currently existing due process protections afforded innocent Americans, you are described as doing the bidding of ``narco-lobbyists.'' 
   This simplistic characterization is not only false and an insult to the Members of this body, it obscures a vitally important civil liberties issue at the core of Title VIII: the rights of innocent American citizens to challenge in our Courts the taking of their property. 
   As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was a conferee to H.R. 1555. However, I did not sign the conference report accompanying the bill because of the contradiction existing 
    between the stated legislative intent of Title VIII and the actual language contained in the bill, a contradiction I attempted but failed in conference to correct by amendment. 
   Specifically, my objection is that Title VIII, as presently written, would undermine the due process protections now afforded to a U.S. citizen or business who has interest in assets blocked under Title VIII to challenge the legality of the blocking under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
   This is what the conference report accompanying H.R. 1555 says about Title VIII: 
   ``There is no intention that this legislation affect Americans who are not knowingly and willfully engaged in international narcotics trafficking. Nor is it intended in any way to derogate from existing constitutional and statutory due process protections for those whose assets are blocked or seized pursuant to law.'' That's the stated intent. But what do the words of this CR do? 
   According to the Department of Treasury, which is tasked in Title VIII with developing the list of significant foreign narcotics traffickers, due process protections exist today for those U.S. citizens to challenge the legality of the blocking of assets in court. 
   On November 8th, I wrote a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers requesting an opinion on two legal questions concerning Title VIII. 
   The first question was: ``What existing constitutional and statutory due process protections would allow an American citizen who has an interest blocked by Executive Branch action to challenge the blocking?'' 
   The second question was: ``If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how would these existing constitutional and statutory due process protections be changed?'' 
   In his November 10, 1999 reply to me, Mr. Richard Newcomb, Director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (or ``OFAC''), stated the following with regard to currently existing judicial review of the blocking of American assets: 
   ``..... the Administrative Procedure Act (the ``APA'') provides for judicial review of final agency action. 5 U.S.C. 702. In existing sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC''), the final agency actions related to blocking are subject to challenge by affected parties through judicial review afforded by the APA. Because of normal rules of standing and other jurisdictional principles, a U.S. citizen may in many cases not be able directly to challenge the blocking of a foreign person's assets pursuant to APA. However, as discussed below, agency review by OFAC, followed by judicial review under APA of any resulting final agency action as to that citizen, may still be available. In addition to any statutory review available under the APA, a U.S. also may seek judicial review of constitutional claims or challenges related to blockings under existing OFAC sanctions programs.'' 
   Under the process currently in place, OFAC determines who is a foreign drug kingpin after an internal Department of Treasury review of the evidence, an evidentiary review that is coordinated with the Department of Justice. Executive Order 12978, issued in 1995, requires that the State and Justice Departments be consulted 
   by Treasury prior to this designation and blocking of assets. After designation is made and assets are blocked, OFAC regulations allow for a named party to petition OFAC to have its designation removed through an administrative appeal. Most petitioners initiate this administrative review process simply by writing OFAC. Exchanges of correspondence, additional fact-finding, and, often, meetings occur before OFAC decides whether there is a basis for removing the designation and unblocking assets. Once the named party has exhausted this administrative remedies process, OFAC's final decision can be challenged in federal court under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
   To repeat, the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, provides some due process protection under current law for an American to challenge the blocking of his or her assets pursuant to a Department of Treasury OFAC agency decision. 
   However, a straightforward reading of section 805 of Title VIII makes clear that these existing statutory due process protections, referenced in the conference report as being unaffected by the bill, could well be, in fact, foreclosed if H.R. 1555 becomes law in its present form. 
   More specifically, section 805(a) of the bill states, in part: ``A significant foreign narcotics trafficker publicly identified ..... shall be subject to any and all sanctions as authorized.'' 
   Section 805(b) of the bill provides that ``all property and interests in property within the United States, or within the possession or control of any United States person'' are blocked effective as of the date of a report designating the significant foreign narcotics traffickers. 
   And then the critically important language of section 805(f): ``The determinations, identifications, finding, and designations made pursuant to section 804 and subsection (b) of this section shall not be subject to judicial review.'' 
   In sum, under Title VII, designation in the drug kingpin report automatically results in the blocking of assets, including any assets held by innocent U.S. citizens and businesses unaware of the association the foreign business entity allegedly has with narcotics trafficking. The blocking of assets, in turn, is not subject to judicial review, according to section 805(f) of the bill. Thus, Title VII would limit the statutory opportunity that exists today under the APA for innocent Americans to petition the courts to challenge the blocking of assets. 
   Could American citizens and businesses with no knowledge 
   of, or participation in, foreign narcotics trafficking find their assets blocked under Title VIII of this bill? Certainly. For example, an American business involved in a joint venture agreement with a foreign shipping firm could find its assets blocked under the provisions of Title VIII. Or, American citizens owning stock in a company found to be owned or operated by drug traffickers and money launderers could have their assets blocked and suffer devastating economic loss as a result, despite being innocent of any wrongdoing themselves.  
   Under current law, the scenarios I have described resulting in the blocking of assets under the control of U.S. citizens, if not remedied in the administrative appeals process, could be challenged in federal court. Title VIII will have the effect of taking away this judicial appeal opportunity, thereby enhancing the authority federal bureaucrats have to not only hear but decide all challenges to Department of Treasury designation and asset blocking decisions. 
   The Department of Treasury confirms this change in statutory due process protections in its November 10th letter to me: 
   ``If H.R. 1555 is enacted, section 805(f) presumably would foreclose U.S. citizens from bringing a claim under the APA to challenge the blocking.'' 
   That is what the Department of Treasury, the agency empowered under current law as expanded by Title VIII to block assets, says about how this bill will foreclose currently existing statutory due process protections.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering a massive appropriations bill in the final hours of a session of Congress. This one spends more than $385 billion, contains legislation which rightly belongs in five separate appropriations bills, and other important legislation which doesn't belong in an appropriations bill at all. This is a process which reflects poorly on the Congress both because it represents a failure to get the nation's work done on time, and because the final rush precludes the kind of careful consideration and debate which wise decisionmaking demands. The combination of its enormous size and the swiftness with which it was thrown together makes certain that Senators will only after the fact learn full details about many provisions which have been added. 
   Democrats have won critical victories in this bill providing funds for new teachers to reduce class size in our schools, a first installment toward 50,000 new police officers by 2005, the necessary funding to implement the Wye River peace agreement and more than $514 million for the Lands Legacy Initiative to preserve and safeguard our most precious public lands, as well as funds for after-school programs to benefit 675,000 students. Other needed legislation is included to reverse some  of the unintended consequences of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act on hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities and legislation to benefit consumers by increasing competition between cable and satellite companies and permitting satellite companies to provide local network signals in local markets. However, like last year, even as I acknowledge some important budget victories, I do not support this process and, on balance, cannot vote for this bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to approve H.R. 748, legislation to repair a constitutional defect in the way the advisory commission was structured in the Act which established the Keweenaw National Historical Park. The Act instructed the Secretary of the Interior to select an Advisory Commission from a list of nominees provided by state and local officials. The Justice Department has taken the position that this provision violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution (Article II, Section 2). 
   Mr. President, I have worked hard to pass this legislation in the Senate which has already passed the House of Representatives. With the President's signature, this legislation can now become law, relieving the uncertainty and ambiguity relative to the commission which has lasted too long by permitting the appointment of the advisory commission to move forward. This will greatly assist in my efforts and those of the many supporters and admirers of this beautiful and historic park. 
   Along with the money being appropriated today for the park, we are giving a major boost to the preservation of this significant part of Michigan's and America's history.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted in support of the Byrd amendment to provide for a 2-year moratorium during which mountain top mining activities may continue under a memorandum of agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA which is in charge of implementation of the Clean Water Act was a party to the agreement which would continue to force during the 2-year moratorium. An environmental impact study will go forward during the moratorium and regulations pursuant to the environmental impact statement can be promulgated. My vote on this amendment does not commit me to support the continuation of any such moratorium beyond this 2-year period during which the courts and the regulatory agencies will more fully evaluate the impacts on both the environment and the affected coal miners and their communities. The fact that the court has stayed the effect of its own opinion is further evidence that this legislative moratorium is both warranted and will do no damage to the underlying act.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in July, when the Senate debated the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary fiscal year 2000 spending bill, an important amendment was adopted to the bill. That amendment, offered by my colleague Senator BOXER, would have made it illegal to sell or transfer firearms or ammunition to anyone under the influence of alcohol. Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee, in working out the differences between the two versions of this spending measure, removed the Senate-passed amendment from the final bill. 
   I do not understand how something so simple, so straightforward, could be deleted from the final bill. This amendment does nothing more than save lives and prevent injuries by prohibiting drunks from buying guns or ammunition. Under current law, it is illegal to sell firearms or ammunition to a purchaser under the influence of illicit drugs. This would simply close the loophole by making it illegal for someone under the influence of alcohol to purchase the same products. 
   It is unconscionable that House and Senate conferees deleted this common-sense provision from the bill. Unfortunately, this is just another example of how reasonable legislation is repeatedly stymied by the power of the NRA.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Republican drug amendment to the bankruptcy bill would authorize private school vouchers for students who are injured by offenses on public school grounds. It allows school districts to use funds from other Federal education programs, including IDEA funds, technology funds and others, to provide vouchers. I will vote against this amendment. I will do so because it will not make our schools safer and it will not invest in student achievement. Ninety percent of students are educated in our nation's public schools. Our public tax dollars should be used for improving public schools, through smaller class size, well-trained teachers, more after-school programs, modern facilities, higher standards, and safe and secure classes. I repeat, vouchers are the wrong way to go. 
   My decision to oppose this amendment is bitter-sweet because while I oppose the voucher provisions of this amendment, I strongly support a provision of the amendment which is, in fact, legislation which I co-authored and introduced with Senator HATCH, Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator BIDEN in January of this year--S. 324, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. It addresses a long-time crusade of mine--that of speeding the development and delivery of anti-addiction medications that block the craving for illicit addictive substances. This is one way in which we can fight and win the war on drugs--by blocking the craving for illegal substances. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act is aimed at achieving this goal. It was originally reported out of the Judiciary Committee as Sec. 18 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, and provides for qualified physicians to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in their offices, under certain strict conditions. I was pleased to have introduced S. 324 along with my distinguished colleagues. I regret that this vital legislation, which can be a tool for fighting and winning the war on drugs, is included in an amendment that I cannot support.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the call to end gun violence has become all too commonplace during this session of Congress. It seems as if each day, another one of us comes to the floor to express our outrage. Last week, it was about workplace violence in Honolulu and Seattle--a total of nine dead. In September it was a church shooting in Texas--a total of seven dead. In August, gun shots were fired in a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles--five injured, and moments later, a federal worker was gunned down on the street. In July, another workplace shooting--again nine people killed, this time in Atlanta. The list goes on and on, including one shooting none of us can forget--15 dead in Littleton. 
   Each month, we watch these tragedies unfold--we witness Americans running and screaming for their lives, toddlers being led hand-in-hand out of danger, even bloody teenagers dangling  from windows. And as the helicopters and SWAT-teams come to more and more of our neighborhoods, we observe scenes that seem more suitable for a horror movie than the front page of our local papers. 
   And, still, each month, we react in the same way. We express outrage, we condemn killers, we call for sensible gun safety legislation, but we do not act. Congress has done nothing this year to control these mass-shootings or in any way, ease the agony that parents and families feel each day when they send their loved ones to school, church, or work. 
   Mr. President, as Congress prepares to adjourn for the year, I send out this reminder: Americans have lost the sense of safety that they once felt in their schools and neighborhoods. They are frightened that the next breaking news story will be filmed on main street, rather than as a ``nightmare on elm street''. It is up to Congress to end gun violence and the all too familiar terror in the lives of ordinary Americans.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator SPECTER, the Money Laundering Abatement Act of 1999. 
   The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of which I am the ranking member, is currently holding hearings on problems specific to private banking, a rapidly-growing financial service in which banks provide one-on-one services tailored to the individual needs of wealthy individuals. The Subcommittee's investigation and hearings show that private bankers have operated in a culture which emphasizes secrecy, impeding account documentation for regulators and law enforcement entities. This culture makes private banking peculiarly susceptible to money laundering. 
   The Money Laundering Abatement Act is intended to supplement and reinforce the current anti-money-laundering laws and bolster the efforts of regulators and law enforcement bodies in this nation and around the world and the efforts of others in Congress. 
   The Subcommittee's year-long investigation and testimony by distinguished financial experts, regulators, and banking industry personnel, revealed that private bankers regularly create devices such as shell corporations established in offshore jurisdictions to hide the source of and movement of clients' funds. The motives may be benign or they may be questionable but one thing is certain: they make it harder for regulators and law enforcement personnel to track the ownership and flow of funds and avert or apprehend laundering of the proceeds of drug and weapons trafficking, tax evasion, corruption, and other malfeasance. To make matters worse, many activities which Americans find reprehensible and which can destabilize regimes and economies are not currently illegal under foreign laws. Therefore, as the current money laundering laws are written, transactions in funds derived from such activities do not constitute money laundering, but they ought to constitute money laundering punishable under United States laws. 
   My bill would patch these holes, particularly as they apply to private banking activities, the volume of which experts predict will grow exponentially as more and more wealth is created and banks compete for this lucrative line of business. Accordingly, I am today introducing legislation that would significantly increase the transparency of our banking system and make it possible for law enforcement and civil process to pierce the veil of secrecy that for too long has made it possible for institutions and individuals operating in largely unregulated off-shore jurisdictions to gain unfettered access to the U.S. financial system for purposes of legitimizing the proceeds of illegal or unsavory activity. 
   A great problem in detecting money laundering is that many private banking transactions are conducted through fictitious entities or under false names or numbered accounts in which the actual or beneficial owner is not identified. The bill requires a financial institution that opens or maintains a U.S. account for a foreign entity to identify and maintain a record in the U.S. of the identity of each direct or beneficial owner of the account. The bill would further help banks in verifying customers' identities by making it illegal to misrepresent the true ownership of an 
   account to a bank. The bill also imposes a ``48-hour rule'' under which, within 48 hours of a request by a federal banking agency, a financial institution would have to provide account information and documentation to the agency. 
   Our investigation into private banking has shown that money launderers may launder their transactions by commingling the proceeds in so-called ``concentration accounts'' and aggregate the funds from multiple customers and transactions. The bill curtails the illicit use of these accounts by prohibiting institutions from using these accounts anonymously. The bill also prohibits U.S. financial institutions from opening or maintaining correspondent accounts with so-called ``brass plate'' banks--most often in off-shore locations--that are not licensed to provide services in their home countries and are not subject to comprehensive home country supervision on a consolidated basis, reducing the likelihood that U.S.-based institutions will receive funds that may derive from illicit sources. 
   The bill would also eliminate significant gaps in current U.S. law by expanding the list of crimes committed on foreign soil that can serve as predicate offenses for money laundering prosecutions in the U.S., including corruption and the misappropriation of IMF funds. It would expand the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, by including transactions in which money is laundered through a foreign bank as a U.S. crime if the transaction has a ``nexus'' in the United States. The bill addresses the reality that governmental corruption weakens economies  and causes political instability and when U.S. banks profit from the fruits of such corruption they run counter to U.S. interests in ending such corruption. 
   Another problem that we have encountered repeatedly in our investigation is that many private banks have written policies that repeatedly stress that the banker must know a customer's identity and source of funds. Yet in practice, many private bankers do not comply with their own bank's policies. To rectify this, the bill requires financial institutions to develop and apply due diligence standards for accounts for private banking customers to verify the customers' identity and source of wealth, both when opening such accounts and on an ongoing basis. 
   Finally, the bill would authorize funding for FinCEN to develop an automated ``alert database.'' FinCEN, an arm of the Department of the Treasury, tracks Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports, important tools in fighting money laundering. However, FinCEN officials have told me that they lack a database which will automatically alert them to patterns of suspicious activity that could indicate money laundering or other illicit activity. Such a database is imperative to enable FinCEN to adequately serve the law enforcement bodies that it supplies information to.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the most prosperous nation in the world, our minimum wage should be a living wage, and it is not. When a father or mother works full-time, 40 hours a week, year-round, they should be able to lift their family out of poverty. $5.15 an hour will not do that. A full time minimum wage job should provide a minimum standard of living in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes with a paycheck. The current minimum wage does not pay a fair wage. 
   I support the legislation introduced by Representative DAVID BONIOR in the House and Senator TED KENNEDY in the Senate which increases the minimum wage. This legislation, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, will provide a 50 cent increase to the minimum wage on January 1, 2000, and a second 50 cent increase on January 1, 2001. This would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour by the year 2001. 
   The minimum wage increase passed in 1996 prevented the minimum wage from falling to its lowest inflation adjusted level in 40 years. The proposed minimum wage increase to $6.15 in 2001 would get the minimum wage back to the inflation adjusted level it was in 1982. 
   In this era of economic growth, raising the minimum wage is a matter of fundamental fairness. We must look around and realize that we have the strongest economy in a generation. However, even with our strong economy, the benefits of prosperity have not flowed to low-wage workers. A full time minimum wage laborer working forty hours a week for 52 weeks earns $10,712 per year--more than $3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. The poverty level for a family of three is $13,880. 
   Some people are saying that it is not time for a minimum wage increase, that we just raised the minimum wage in 1996 and in 1997. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the last minimum wage increase of 1996-97, the national unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1%. Not only that, the unemployment rate has dropped in Michigan, it is now 3.4%--lower than the national rate. It is only right that we help these minimum wage earners when the economy is booming. 
   Retail jobs are often cited as the industry hit hardest by an increase in the minimum wage. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 38,900 new retail jobs have been added in Michigan since the last minimum wage increase. Moreover, in Michigan, since September of 1996, 206,000 new jobs have been created. The opponents claimed that the 1996 minimum wage increase would devastate the economy, yet clearly, this has not been the case. 
   According to the United States Department of Labor, 60% of minimum wage earners are women; nearly three-fourths are adults; more than half work full time. Under the Fair Minimum Wage Act, approximately 243,000 Michiganders would get a raise. These hardworking Americans deserve a fair deal. 
   The Fair Minimum Wage Act will increase the real value of the minimum wage in 2001 to the purchasing level it was in 1982. It will generate $2,000 in potential income for minimum wage workers. This $2,000 will make an enormous impact on minimum wage workers and their families. 
   Opponents of the minimum wage have said that the minimum wage hurts low income workers. This is not the case. In 1998, seventeen economists, including a Nobel Prize winner, a former president of the American Economics Assn. and a former Secretary of Labor, wrote to President Clinton, supporting an increase in the minimum wage. These experts determined that  the 1996 and 1997 increases had a beneficial effect, not only on those whose earnings were increased, but also on the economy as a whole. In addition to directly impacting workers, billions in added consumer demand helped fuel our expanding economy in those years. 
   With a prosperous economy, it is only fair that we also reward those who are at the low end of the pay scale spectrum. These people do not always have the leverage to negotiate a fair salary. It is necessary that we act to ensure that they receive a livable wage.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment I will offer requires the Federal Reserve to submit a report to the Senate and House Banking Committees concerning: (1) whether the location of the residence of an applicant for a credit card is considered by a financial institution in determining whether the applicant should be granted such card; and (2) the purposes for which such location is taken into consideration by such institution. 
   Mr. President, an individual's credit worthiness should be judged on his or her own credit history and not on where that individual happens to live. The stereotyping of consumers based on where they live is a social evil with very negative social consequences. The Congress has been instrumental in formulating legislation that seeks equal credit opportunity for all. If creditworthy persons can be rejected on account of his or her place of residence, our work is incomplete. Credit applicants should be considered on the basis of their individualized creditworthiness and not on the basis of place of residence.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to explain my amendment to S. Res. 208 expressing the sense of the Senate on United States policy toward NATO and the European Union and my own personal view regarding the desirability of our European Allies conducting operations in their own backyard. 
   My amendment makes three important changes to the language of the resolution as reported out by the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   First of all, the amendment substitutes ``the'' for ``its'' before ``European Security and Defense Identity'' to make the point that the European Security and Defense Identity, or ESDI, is being developed within, not outside, the NATO Alliance. This simple fact is enshrined in a number of North Atlantic Council communiques and declarations, starting with the Declaration of Heads of State and Government issued at the Council meeting in Brussels on June 11, 1994. This is important because the development of the ESDI within the Alliance means that, as the 1994 Brussels Declaration stated, ``NATO will remain the essential forum for consultation among its members and the venue for agreement on policies bearing on security and defense commitments of Allies under the Washington Treaty.'' 
   Next, my amendment deletes the references to NATO being ``offered the opportunity to undertake the mission'' and then that NATO ``referred it to the European Union for action.'' The first point here is that on one has to offer a mission to NATO; the North Atlantic Council is in permanent session so that it can continuously review events that could impact on stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and can react to them, if necessary. Consequently, it doesn't have to be offered an opportunity to undertake a mission; it has that responsibility and the means to effect it on a continuing basis. The next point is that NATO doesn't refer a mission to the European Union; the EU will undoubtedly have been following such an  event on its own and won't need a referral from NATO to do so. And the final and perhaps most important point is that this change removes the connotation that somehow the European Union is subservient to NATO. 
   The last change is to simply substitute ``should'' for ``must'' in the subparagraph relating to the implementation of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. This will avoid the connotation that the United States is dictating to an organization of sovereign states. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my own personal view concerning the desirability of our European Allies conducting operations in their own backyard. I have long been a supporter of the ESDI and I am a supporter of the U.S.-sponsored Defense Capabilities Initiative that was recently adopted by NATO. NATO's Operation Allied Force demonstrated a capabilities gap between the United States and our NATO Allies. I welcome the stated determination of our European Allies to develop the capability to act on their own. I welcome the fact that they are providing more than 80 percent of the forces participating in the NATO-led Kosovo Force. I would welcome it if our European Allies would handle the next crisis that develops in Europe. I would be happy if the United States' contribution was limited, for instance, to providing such things as command and control, communications, and intelligence support and I would be even more pleased if the United States didn't have to provide any support and our European Allies were capable of handling a crisis on their own. 
   I have characterized the United States as being a junior partner and the European Allies being the senior partner in the KFOR peacekeeping mission. I know that there are many people, including some within the Administration who don't like that characterization, but I see nothing wrong with it. 
   Mr. President, the United States Congress for years has urged Europe to play a greater role in its own defense and to bear more of the collective security burden in NATO. I, for one, can take yes for an answer.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Armed Services Committee received testimony from recently-retired German General Klaus Naumann, the former Chairman of NATO's Military Committee. In that capacity, General Naumann was NATO's highest ranking military officer and headed the NATO organization which consists of the Chiefs of Defense, i.e. the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton and his counterparts, of all 19 NATO countries and to which NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General Wesley Clark, and Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, Admiral Harold Gehman, report. 
   The topic for the hearing was lessons learned from NATO's Operation Allied Force, the air campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I hope that my colleagues will read General Naumann's thoughtful, straight-forward, and insightful statement. But, I want to highlight a few of General Naumann's conclusions--conclusions with which I agree and whose implications I believe merit careful consideration by us all. 
   First and most importantly, General Naumann concluded that ``it was the cohesion of our 19 nations which brought about success.'' In the course of the hearing, he pointed out that this cohesion was maintained despite the fact that, for example, polls indicated that some 95 percent of Greek citizens opposed the operation. 
   General Naumann also concluded that ``it will be virtually impossible to use the devastating power of modern military forces in coalition operations to the fullest extent'' but that this disadvantage ``is partly compensated by the much stronger political impact a coalition operation has as compared to the operation of a single nation.'' In that regard, I asked General Naumann for his reaction to a lesson that, I believe, applies. The lesson is not that we ought to use less than decisive force but that if that is not an option, then the judgment that must be made is whether or not the risk in utilizing what I call ``maximum achievable force,'' i.e. the maximum force that is politically achievable and which is less than decisive force, whether the risk involved outweighs the value of proceeding. General Naumann, as General Clark did in a prior hearing, agreed that it was a lesson learned from NATO's air campaign and that the question or balancing test that I posed was the proper one. 
   General Naumann had a number of other lessons and sage advice for us, such as that the United States should fully support the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within the Alliance and that ESDI can strengthen the transatlantic link. Once again, I strongly urge my colleagues to read General Naumann's statement.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is prepared to pass the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation to strengthen SBA's Women's Business Centers in Michigan and across the nation which help entrepreneurs start and maintain successful businesses by providing such things as start-up help and financial expertise to women-owned businesses. This legislation will allow those Women's Business Centers that are already successfully participating in the program to recompete for Federal funding after their initial funding term expires. These Centers would have previously been ineligible for renewed funding. 
   Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of small businesses in America and provide innumerable jobs and resources to the state of Michigan and around the country. Last year, women-owned businesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million small businesses in the United States. The Women's Business Center program offers important tools to women who want to start or expand small businesses. However, the program is in danger of losing many effective Centers because the Centers are finding it increasingly difficult to raise the required non-Federal matching funds necessary to keep the programs running. 
   This legislation allows existing Centers to recompete for Federal funds, but sets the recompetition standards higher than those used for centers applying for their initial five-year funding term. This is to take into account established Centers' higher levels of experience and ensures that Centers meeting the highest standards can continue to get funded. The ability of established and successful Women's Business Development Centers to continue to compete for Federal funding means that critical resources will continue to be made available for women-owned businesses for such purposes as training and obtaining business financing. 
   Michigan has three Women's Business Centers, the Center for Empowerment and Economic Development, CEED, which houses the Women's Initiative for Self-Employment, WISE, in Ann Arbor, the Grand Rapids Opportunities for Women, GROW, in Grand Rapids, and The Detroit Entrepreneurship Institute, Inc, DEI. 
   These Michigan programs offer women who want to open a small business a comprehensive package of business education and training, start-up financing, technical assistance, peer group support and access to community and government supportive resources such as child care. Michigan's Women's Business Centers strongly support this legislation and believe they need to be able to recompete for Federal resources in order to continue to be able to offer the current levels of services and support to Michigan's women-owned businesses. This bill would allow them to do that. 
   I am pleased that Congress has continued to recognize the importance of funding the Women's Business Center program. In 1997, Congress enacted legislation to make a 1989-1991 pilot project a permanent part of the Small Business Administration programs available to help entrepreneurs start and maintain successful business. It also doubled the annual funding of the Women's Business Centers and extend the funding period from 3 to 5 years. And just this year, Congress enacted legislation to change the non-Federal and Federal funding ratio requirements and it again increased the annual authorization level from $8 million to $11 million. 
   The legislation that will be passed by the Senate today under a unanimous consent agreement will allow existing Women's Business Centers to compete for additional Federal funding. It also authorizes increased appropriations for the program for 4 years. It increases the FY 2000 and FY 2001 authorization from $11 million to $12 million. It also authorizes appropriations of $12.8 million in FY 2001; $13.7 million in FY 2002; and $14.5 million in FY 2003 for this program. 
   This is an important piece of legislation and I am pleased my Senate colleagues are supporting it.

   Mr. LEVIN. During Senate consideration of S. 900, I was concerned with the ability of banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to enter into these new activities, and how these new activities would be regulated and by whom. In particular, I was concerned with how the securities activities of banks would be regulated. In the original version of S. 900 there were loopholes which allowed the securities activities of banks to go unregulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. I felt that these loopholes should be closed. I believe that it makes the most sense for the regulators who have the most experience in securities transactions, namely the SEC, to oversee these activities.

This amendment was agreed to during Senate consideration of S. 900.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, both the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit have proclaimed the month of October ``Respect Month'' for the past decade and October 30th ``Respect Your Neighborhood Day''. These designations give us the opportunity to recognize and celebrate the many daily acts of service, that sometimes go unnoticed, but are so vital to binding our communities and nation together with harmony and unity. Over the last month, organizations and schools in Michigan took the opportunity to give young people a greater acceptance of the similarities and differences of others. 
   The principle of respect is especially important in the aftermath of last school year's shootings. While our nation is focused on creating an atmosphere free from fear and violence, it is important to pause and reflect on our respect for one another. Respect is a valuable lesson for the schools who are struggling to repair the damage these  horrific acts of violence have caused. In fact, in the last few weeks I have reported several incidences of gun violence which have devastated families and school communities, leaving many people wondering what we, as a nation, can do to prevent these tragedies, and how we can reinforce the rule of respect. 
   I believe there are many things that we can do to make a difference. I have stated many times that one of the first things Congress can do is limit the easy access to firearms by our young people. I will continue to speak out about the need for strengthening our gun laws, but I also believe that there are other critical components of the complex puzzle of youth violence and one of them is respect. Devoting a month to respect provides an excellent avenue by which our young people can focus on the importance of honor, acceptance, and values. 
   While this is not expected to end all violence, it is my hope that by continuing to implement the lessons of respect in our daily lives, we can, in fact, make a positive impact in neighborhoods, not only across Michigan, but across the country as well.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, President Clinton recently emphasized that while expanding trade, we also need to have basic labor standards so that people who work receive the dignity and reward of their work. The President said the WTO should create a working group in Seattle on trade and labor and asked, ``How we can deny the legitimacy or the linking of these issues, trade and labor, in a global economy?'' 
   How, indeed? The rhetoric sounds right--that we should link the granting of trade benefits to whether countries are abiding by internationally recognized standards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights. This should be especially the case when these countries have freely undertaken such obligations in treaties or conventions. This is a laudable objective and one that the Administration is now promoting. But how do we implement this objective? 
   We have our first test case under consideration before the Senate today. We should begin to promote standards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights as part of our trade relationships by considering progress on those goals when unilaterally granting a trade benefit. In considering whether to grant a country a unilateral trade benefit, the President surely ought to consider the extent to which that country has undertaken its own existing obligations, obligations under treaties and conventions it has freely entered into relative to child labor, collective bargaining, the use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights. Unfortunately, in the bill under consideration today, the President is not required to even consider this factor. 
   Mr. President, the trade bill we are considering contains two provisions that would provide trade benefits to certain countries unilaterally without asking that reciprocal action be taken. 
   This bill is flawed and it doesn't live up to our repeatedly stated beliefs. It contains no required consideration of  the extent to which a beneficiary country has undertaken to live up to its own commitments to internationally recognized standards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights, before the country may receive the trade benefit conferred in the bill. I believe the extent to which a country demonstrates a willingness to abide by its own commitments freely undertaken, be it to labor standards, or anything else, should be an element that is at least considered when determining a country's eligibility to receive special benefits. 
   As the bill is currently written, before granting the trade benefits, the President must make certain determinations, such as determining if the country has demonstrated a commitment to undertake WTO obligations and to take steps to join the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA). Only as a secondary consideration, the President may consider, when determining if the country has demonstrated a commitment to the WTO and FTAA, additional criteria, including the extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker rights. 
   This is not strong enough because it is a discretionary standard that the President is not required to even consider and it is also only a secondary consideration that can be taken into account when making a determination as to whether a country has demonstrated a commitment to pursue certain other ends. It is not an end in itself. 
   It seems to me that the type of trade benefit we are considering today, a one-way-granting by the United States of duty free treatment, is a logical place to include a consideration of whether a country is attempting to live up to its own obligations it has freely undertaken with regard to standards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights. 
   The President has said he wants to start to link trade and labor standards and will take steps to try to achieve this in the next round of WTO negotiations starting in Seattle. We should start here at home by requiring that the extent to which a beneficiary country has demonstrated a commitment to abide by obligations it has already undertaken in treaties and conventions it has freely entered into relative to child labor, collective bargaining, use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other worker rights. If we can't even include such a consideration in today's legislation, how do we expect to succeed in including such provisions in a multilateral negotiation of over 130 member nations? 
   Mr. President, I am offering an amendment which would require consideration of internationally recognized labor standards when determining if a CBI country may benefit from unilateral trade preferences. My amendment would require the President, when designating a CBTEA beneficiary country, to consider the extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker rights, such as the right of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively; prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or compulsory labor and a minimum age for the employment of children. 
   Most CBI countries are signatories of the International Labor Organization conventions. Considering the extent to which these countries abide by their own international obligations is the least we can do when considering whether they deserve to receive unilateral trade preferences from us.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is a difficult vote for me. This bill contains provisions I support such as the reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA) and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. But the  CBI provision of the bill is troubling because it extends benefits unilaterally without assurances that reciprocal trade benefits will be granted to U.S. products. 
   However, with the adoption of the Levin-Moynihan amendment some progress is assured because under this amendment, the President would be required to take into consideration the extent to which a country provides internationally recognized worker rights, including child labor, collective bargaining, the use of forced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and labor standards before the trade benefit can be granted. 
   The adoption of this amendment is a major reason I have decided to vote for this bill. 
   I hope this provision can be further strengthened in Conference. However, at a minimum, Senator MOYNIHAN has assured me a strong effort will be made to retain the provision in Conference.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, students from around the country came to Washington to ask for help. Students participating in the Children's March for Gun Control marched hand-in-hand to Capitol Hill with a simple demand: to keep them safe from guns. 
   Members of Congress should tune out the NRA, and start listening to these children--who have to face the fear of guns everyday. The children from across the country are pleading that Congress create an environment free from fear and violence. These children are armed, not with firearms, but with letters, urging Congress to end the epidemic of gun violence that claims the lives of thousands of their peers each year. 
   Yet, while Congress should be passing comprehensive legislation to prevent school shootings like those in Conyers, Littleton, Springfield, Edinboro, Jonesboro, West Paducah, Pearl and the many others, it cannot even muster enough votes to take UZIs and AK-47s out of the hands of 15 year olds. After Columbine, the Senate took a few steps to protect children from gun violence. We passed legislation to prohibit juveniles from owning semiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammunition devices. We passed an amendment to require that handguns be sold with trigger locking devices to protect children. And we passed an amendment to close the gun show loophole, ensuring juveniles and others cannot use these shows as a convenient way to circumvent the safeguards applied to normal sales through licensed gun dealers. 
   That legislation was a first step, but it still falls short of closing loopholes which allow our youth easy access to deadly weapons. For example, one of our most important tasks yet will be to ban handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons for persons under 21 years of age. Yet, even the most minimal effort to end gun violence has been stymied in the House of Representatives, where they have passed no gun safety legislation. And any effort to come to some agreement has been repeatedly stalled by the Republican leadership. 
   It was great to welcome such a group of dedicated young people to the nation's Capitol. I encourage them to keep up their effort and to speak out for those children who have been silenced by guns. Over time, these children are sure to accomplish what other nations have done: end the plague of gun violence.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every Member of our Senate family was  gripped in sadness and grief when we heard of the death of John Chafee. 
   John Chafee was a giant for many reasons. He was a kind man. He was a truly gentle and a magnificently decent Senator. 
   Time and time again, as towering Senators of the past, John Chafee, a pragmatist, a moderate, a man of sound judgment and good sense, worked to cool the partisan passions in this body and led his colleagues of both parties toward common ground. 
   He was one of those Members to whom Senators looked for advice and for leadership on the host of issues in which he was an expert--health issues, environmental issues, transportation, and many issues where he was one of the most knowledgeable and effective leaders of this body. 
   He brought to this body an experience which was invaluable, as a marine, a war hero in two wars, and in the legislative battles of the Senate. One frequently sensed in John Chafee the kind of quiet self-confidence and steady determination of somebody who had survived real combat. 
   John Chafee was direct. He was without guile. He did not posture as he ambled about this body. He just talked straight and let his friends and his colleagues know what was on his mind and asked how he might be helpful. 
   There were no hidden agendas with John Chafee--just a straightforward, good-natured, decent and kind human being who cared deeply about the people of Rhode Island and of this Nation and who shared everything he had with us and with this Nation. 
   I visited often with John Chafee in his office, going there for advice to try to gather from him some of the wisdom which he had gathered over the years. 
   I shall miss, as will every Member of this body, his shy smile, his special integrity. He left an indelible mark on our hearts. I don't know whether his name is carved yet in that desk which has the flowers upon it. But he left a very deep mark on all of our hearts, on all of our souls, and on all of our spirits. 
   We can only hope his family takes comfort in the certain knowledge that John Chafee will be missed by a legion of friends, by all of his colleagues, and we will be sustained by his memory, by his integrity, by his character, and by his good nature. 
   As long as we serve in the Senate, every one of us who had the honor and privilege of serving with John Chafee will remember him in a very special way. 
   Again, I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Michigan Rehabilitation Association, a remarkable organization from my home state of Michigan, which will celebrate its 50th Anniversary on November 1, 1999. 
   Over the past five decades, the Michigan Rehabilitation Association (MRA) has proudly worked to meet the needs of Michigan's disabled community. While beginning as a professional association for rehabilitation practitioners, it has quickly grown into one of Michigan's leading advocates for the welfare and rights of handicapped people. While its scope and purpose have evolved, its members have remained steadfastly committed to excellence in the delivery of services to the disabled. 
   Since its inception in 1949 as the country's first state chapter of the National Rehabilitation Association, the MRA's far-reaching hand has helped thousands of Michigan's citizens achieve a higher quality of life. As it celebrates this important milestone, I am sure its staff, friends and supporters will have the opportunity to recall its many successes. I am pleased to join with them in thanking the people of the Michigan Rehabilitation Association for their efforts while applauding all the hard work and determination that have resulted in the MRA's prestigious reputation. 
   The Michigan Rehabilitation Association can take pride in the many important achievements of its first fifty years. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting the accomplishments of MRA's first half century and in wishing it continued success for the future.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I reveal yet another tragedy in my state. Early this week, in the dormitories of Kalamazoo College, a 20 year old student allegedly shot and killed his former girlfriend, before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide. Now, two students are dead, and the relatively small campus in Kalamazoo is in deep shock over the loss of their fellow classmates. 
   The apparent murder-suicide was announced in a campus-wide email, sent to all students to inform them that classes and school events would be canceled, trained counselors would be on hand, and a mass grieving assembly would take place on the campus quadrangle. To many, such an announcement must have seemed like a terrible nightmare. But students soon realized that this tragedy was not a dream and this week they have been trying to make sense of such senseless violence. 
   This week, students are being taught the most valuable lesson they'll ever learn in college. Unfortunately, it's a lesson learned the hard way. What they will take away from this tragedy is the knowledge that guns can destroy innocent lives and devastate families; guns can result in pain, suffering, and loss of quality of life; and gun violence will continue to be a reoccurring nightmare for our young people unless Congress controls the easy access of guns among minors.

   Mr. LEVIN. The majority leader has authorized me to allocate time to myself. I yield to myself 4 minutes. 
   A majority of the House and a majority in the Senate support campaign finance reform. It was clearly indicated yesterday that we have a majority in favor of campaign finance reform. A minority of the Senate is not in favor of campaign finance reform, and they have decided to try to block the will of the majority, which is their right. They can filibuster this legislation to which they are so strongly opposed, and I defend their right to oppose this legislation with all their might, although I disagree with them with all my might. 
   The supporters of campaign finance reform have every right to try to pass the bill. That means we have every right to not agree to withdraw campaign finance reform legislation just because we didn't get cloture on the first, second, or third vote. It took four votes to get civil rights legislation passed in the late 1960s and 7 weeks to get that legislation passed. It wouldn't have passed had the supporters of civil rights legislation, after they did not get the necessary votes to adopt cloture the first time, backed off from their cause. 
   We, the supporters of campaign finance reform, are just as passionately in support of closing the soft money loophole as the opponents are passionate in their opposition. We do not need to withdraw as long as we are in the majority. We don't have to go quietly into that good night after a failed cloture vote. 
   This vote we are about to take on a motion to proceed to another item of business, this motion to end the Senate's consideration of campaign finance reform in the face of a filibuster by the opposition, is the vote that really counts on campaign finance reform. This is the moment of truth. A cloture vote simply decided that we did not succeed in breaking the filibuster. Today the majority will decide whether to give in to that filibuster. That is what this vote is about, whether or not a majority of this Senate which favors closing the campaign loopholes in the law that are supposed to put limits on how much a person can contribute to a campaign or candidate, gives in to a filibuster, whether those laws which have been so totally undermined by the soft money loophole, in effect, will be restored to good health. That is the decision we are going to make. 
   This is the vote that tests the determination of supporters of campaign finance reform against the determination of the opponents--whether the majority which went on record yesterday as favoring campaign finance reform will say we are going to give up our cause for whatever length of time because we haven't gotten 60 votes yet. We would not have had civil rights legislation if that were the position taken by the supporters of civil rights--8 long weeks on just one of the civil rights bills in the 1960s and four cloture votes, which finally, with the help of a bipartisan group, were able to take them over the finish line. 
   Yes, the opponents have a right to filibuster, a right to tie up the Senate. However, we in the majority on campaign finance reform do not have to back down. This is the vote that counts: Whether we in the majority agree we will move to something else or whether we will say to the filibusters they may do what they are doing under our rules and we will defend that right, but we need not and will not back down to that filibuster. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. I want to clarify what the Democratic leader has done. He has offered unanimous consent to go to partial-birth abortion because if we go to it that way, after it is disposed of and resolved, we would automatically then come back to campaign finance reform and resolve that issue; is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. If I may further ask the Democratic leader, even though many of us oppose the bill relative to partial-birth abortion, we have nonetheless agreed that we would go to it by unanimous consent because, after it was then disposed of, however it was disposed of, we could then come back to this critical issue of campaign finance reform; is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. My final question is this: Is that not the reason why this upcoming vote--when it comes--on the motion to proceed then becomes the defining vote as to whether or not we want to take up campaign finance reform? Because if we move to proceed to partial-birth abortion, if that motion is adopted, then campaign finance reform goes back on the calendar. So this upcoming vote--whenever it occurs--on the question of moving to proceed to partial-birth abortion then becomes the defining vote ahead of us on the question of campaign finance reform.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be casting the critical vote which will decide whether or not those of us who are in the majority will insist that this body continue on the debate on campaign finance reform. This will be the vote that counts. This will determine whether the majority will back off because our bill is being filibustered. This is a real test vote tomorrow in the battle to close the soft money loophole. 
   We knew it was not going to be easy. We knew this was going to be filibustered. But it is not the first time that major legislation involving key democratic principles has been filibustered on the floor of this Senate. Those of us who favor closing the soft money loophole, reducing the influence of huge contributions in political campaigns, it seems to me, now have to be just as committed, just as determined, just as passionate in our beliefs as the opponents are in their beliefs. 
   The opponents have every right to filibuster our bill. The rules allow filibusters. We ought to change those rules, but until we do, most, if not all, of us participate, from time to time, in cloture votes, making the other side get to 60 before we proceed. But just as the minority has a right to filibuster a bill, those of us who are in the majority have the right to say we are not going to back off just because a bill is being filibustered. We are not going to give up our effort. Rather, we are going to say to the opponents of this bill who are in the minority and who are filibustering our bill: That is your right and you have a right to exercise it. Proceed with the filibuster. We are not going to withdraw our legislation. 
   During the civil rights days there were instances where there had to be multiple cloture votes. There was a bill 
   relative to fair housing in 1968 which had four cloture votes over a period of 7 or 8 weeks before there were enough votes to end the debate. The people who passionately believed in civil rights proceeded with their cause. They did not give up because they did not get enough votes to close off debate and to end the filibuster the first time. They did not give up the second time. They did not give up the third time; 7 or 8 weeks later, on their fourth cloture vote, finally they were able to achieve success. 
   I was reading these debates from the civil rights days, 1968, last night. I read some of the speeches of a whole bunch of great Senators on both sides of the issue: Senators Mansfield, Hart, Ervin, and other Senators, Javits. They were debating civil rights. It was a controversial bill. It involved whether or not citizens would have a right to housing free from discrimination based on race. 
   What struck me was the determination of the supporters of civil rights, the unwillingness to give in, give up, because they could not get enough votes the first time around to stop the filibuster. Senator Hart, after they lost the first cloture vote said:  
   Those of us who support the bill that has been pending now for, I think, 6 weeks, on the occasion of the vote last week ..... indicated our intention to submit a modification today or prior to the vote today. The modification would lessen somewhat the reach of the coverage and make some procedural changes. 
   I want to report that over the weekend a new and most encouraging factor has developed. It is a new force and gives a new dimension and promise for those of us who believe with a very deep conviction that this country needs to be assured that what a majority of the Senate has plainly indicated it desires to achieve can be achieved, an effective ..... open housing order.  
   Today, a majority of the Senate, in the words of Senator Hart, ``plainly indicated'' that it desires to achieve campaign finance reform. On one vote, there were 52 Senators; on another vote, there were 53 Senators. Today a clear majority of this Senate plainly indicated that it wants to achieve campaign finance reform. 
   Then it occurred, the third time they tried to attain an end to the filibuster. By this time, Senator Dirksen, who was the Republican leader, who had been a supporter of civil rights prior to this bill in the earlier days of the 1960s--Senator Dirksen, in 1968, after voting against ending debate the first and second time, decided that, with certain changes in the legislation, he was going to vote to terminate a filibuster in which he had participated. He said:  
   The matter of equality of opportunity in civil rights is an idea whose time has come. And all the fulminations, whether substantial or superficial, will not stay the march of that idea.  
   The time has come for us to end the unlimited amount of money which flows into campaigns. This is an idea whose time has come. A majority of us have so voted. A majority of us feel strongly about it, and the public, much more important than either of those comments, feels very strongly about it. They are sickened by the amount of negative advertising they are bombarded with. They are sickened when they read about $50,000 and $100,000 and $1 million going into political parties in order, mainly, to fund these negative TV ads. 
   They are sickened when they read about a Democratic Party invitation or a Republican Party invitation that sells access to our key leaders for big contributions. They are disgusted when they see an invitation that reads: For $50,000 a year, you get two annual events with the President, two annual events with the Vice President, and you get to join party leadership as they travel abroad to examine current developing political and economic issues in other countries. 
   They are disgusted when they see for $250,000 you get breakfast with the majority leader and the Speaker and you get a luncheon with the Senate Republican committee chairman of your choice. So for $250,000 you get a luncheon with the committee chairman of your choice. What do we expect the American public to think when they hear and read about that? And that is directly connected to the soft money loophole. 
   The scourge of soft money, of unlimited contributions, inherently breeds distrust for our democratic institutions. It is something that is inherent in the unlimited amount of the contribution. 
   Now, many of us believe very strongly that is true. But far more important than that is what the Supreme Court has said about this issue. In the Buckley case itself, a case which we all look to, and I will quote from, the Supreme Court said the following about the ``appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions.......'' Those are the words of the Court, and now I am going to read the entire quote:  
   And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed.  
   The Buckley Court went on to say the following:  
   Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated.  
   Then the Court wrote about the contributions which are given either for a quid pro quo or for the appearance of a quid pro quo. This is what they wrote:  
   To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political quid pro quos from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined........Of almost equal concern is......  
   That is, equal now to the quid pro quo--  
   the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. ..... Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence ``is also critical.......if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.''  
   The Supreme Court wrote that before the soft money loophole became fully  exploited, before invitations, such as the kind I read from, went out telling people if they contribute $250,000 or $100,000, they will get meetings with the majority leader or they will get meetings with the President or they will get meetings with the committee chairman of their choice. This kind of sale of access, which we see in such a disgraceful display, I believe, on the part of both parties, was not even in existence at the time the Buckley Court wrote that 
   opinion. 
   Both parties are engaged in this. This is not pointing the finger at either party. Both parties engaged in soliciting these huge--unlimited just about--amounts of money in exchange for access. And that is soft money. That is unregulated money. That is money above and beyond what is permitted to be directly contributed to a candidate. 
   In fact, the Supreme Court was very explicit about another provision of the law which provides that $25,000 is the limit which can be given in all contributions during a year. The Supreme Court said this about the $25,000. They describe the $25,000 limit as a modest restraint which serves, in the words of the Court, ``to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate or huge contributions to a candidate's political party.'' 
   So we have a $25,000 per year limit in the law. That is the most you can give to a candidate or to a party, and the purpose, the Court said, was legitimate to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limit to any particular candidate. And yet we have parties soliciting $250,000 and $50,000 and $100,000. That is the state of decay of our campaign financing. 
   So what we will decide in our vote tomorrow morning is whether or not the majority of this body--which has voted today to support the elimination of the soft money loophole--the majority of this body, which has voted today for campaign finance reform, will be willing to simply withdraw because the filibusterers have, so far, succeeded in stopping us from getting to 60 votes. That is what we will decide tomorrow. 
   This great Senate is a battleground where wills are tested, where people who believe strongly in one side of an issue will test their commitment against people who believe strongly in the other side of an issue. Everybody in this body has rights. The majority has rights. The minority has rights. The minority has a right to filibuster, a right which I will defend until we change those rules. 
   But the majority surely has the right not to give up in the face of a filibuster. The majority has a right--indeed, I believe an obligation on a matter of this principle--not to simply say: Well, we didn't succeed the first time or the second time, so we're just going to throw in the towel. 
   If we feel keenly about this issue--as the majority, I believe and hope, does--then tomorrow, when that vote comes, we should vote not to move to other business. It has nothing to do with what the other business is. 
   The issue tomorrow morning isn't whether or not we favor or oppose late-term abortions. That is not the issue. That was clear when the Democratic leader offered a unanimous consent request to move to the late-term abortions bill, to move to the late-term abortions bill by unanimous consent, which would have allowed us to then return, immediately after the disposition of that issue, to the campaign finance reform. But the Republican leader, our majority leader, objected to that unanimous consent proposal and as a result made a motion. And if this motion succeeds, then campaign finance reform goes back to the calendar and is put on the shelf. 
   The vote tomorrow is the acid test vote as to whether or not we in the majority, who favor the closing of the soft money loophole, who believe that loophole is the principal culprit in the erosion of our campaign finance laws, those of us who believe that soft money has blown the lid off the contribution limits of our campaign finance system, those of us who believe the appearance of impropriety, which is created when people are solicited for huge sums of money to political parties and those parties, of course, turn around and spend it relative to campaigns and candidates, which is their business, those of us who believe keenly that this system is broken and we have to close this loophole--tomorrow will be the acid test for us. Tomorrow we will be put to the test. 
   It is not an easy test for all of us. Tomorrow we will be asked whether or not we are willing to move to other business, to put back on the calendar, to put on the shelf, this fight for campaign finance reform. 
   It is my hope the vote tomorrow will be at least as strong as the vote we had today, that 52 or 53 of us will say: No, we want to stay on this bill or come back to this bill automatically; we want to address an issue which has created such a terrible feeling in the stomachs and the hearts of our people. That is the feeling that is created when this huge amount of money washes into these political campaigns and when it is used to buy the kind of access which is purchased from both political parties. 
   This will be the acid test vote. This is the key vote. I hope we can live up to the responsibility we have to fight as hard for something we believe in as the opponents oppose with all their hearts. I hope we can do what was done in the days of the civil rights bills, where one failure to stop a filibuster did not deter the supporters of civil rights, where two failures to stop a filibuster did not deter the supporters of civil rights, where three failures did not stop the supporters of civil rights. They proceeded. They amended. They modified. They worked the issue because civil rights day had come. And just as the day for campaign finance reform has now come, I hope we can live up to our responsibility tomorrow and vote not to move to other business but, rather, to stay on this issue, to put the public focus on this issue, to say to those who would filibuster, that is your right, but we are not going to withdraw simply because you in the minority are filibustering this important cause. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and all my colleagues. I particularly thank Senator WELLSTONE for allowing me to go at this time. 
   Mr. President, our Federal election laws are broken, and the issue before the Senate is whether we want to fix them. 
   In the 1970s, we passed laws to limit the role of money in Federal elections. Our intent was to protect our democratic form of government from the corrosive influence of unlimited political contributions. 
   We wanted to ensure that our Federal elected officials were, neither in reality nor in perception, beholden to special interests who were able to contribute large sums of money to candidates and their campaigns. 
   Our election laws were designed to protect the public's confidence in our democratically elected officials. And for many years our election laws worked fairly well. The limits they set were clear, and those laws are on the books today. 
   Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate per election, or $5,000 to a political action committee, or more than $20,000 a year to a national party committee, or $25,000 total in any one year. Corporations and unions are prohibited from contributing to any campaign. That is the law on the books today. This is the election law: $1,000 per individual to a candidate in an election; $5,000 to a PAC. It is right in these laws--$5,000 PAC contribution to a candidate. 
   We are supposed to be limiting contributions to candidates. Yet, over the last few years, we have heard story after story about contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, corporations, and unions, and even about contributions from foreign sources. Then the question is, How is it possible, when the law says $1,000 to a candidate per election, that people can give $100,000, which effectively helped that candidate in that election? How is it possible? 
   This pretty good law of ours has holes in it, and both parties have taken  advantage of them. There are no longer any effective limits on contributions. That is the bottom line. That is why we hear about a $1 million contribution to the RNC from a corporation, or a half-million-dollar contribution from one couple to the DNC. 
   The Supreme Court in Buckley surely did not have this in mind. They understood the limits to mean that individuals can't contribute more than the overall $25,000 limit for a calendar year. Look at what they said when they upheld that provision in the law. The Buckley Court described the $25,000 limit as a modest restraint which ``serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate or a huge contribution to the candidate's political party.'' Yet that is exactly what is happening today under the soft money loophole. 
   So the Supreme Court foresaw that people would try to evade the $1,000 limit unless the Congress put in a $25,000 limit. They said that is one of the reasons the $25,000 limit per year is appropriate. 
   Yet, under the soft money loophole, precisely what is happening today is that the $1,000 limit has been obliterated, for all intents and purposes. Our task is to make the law whole again and, in making it whole, to make it effective. If we don't, we risk losing the faith the American people have that we represent their interests and that each citizen's voice counts fairly. 
   The principal culprit in this erosion of our laws is the soft money loophole. Soft money has blown the lid off the contribution limits of our campaign finance system. Soft money is the 800,000-pound gorilla sitting right in the middle of this debate. 
   Look at the most recent data with respect to soft money contributions. In the 1996 Presidential election year, Republicans raised $140 million in soft money contributions; Democrats raised $120 million. In 1998, even without a Presidential election, Republicans raised $131 million in soft money contributions and Democrats raised $91 million. The 1997-1998 combined soft money total was 115 percent more than the 1993-1994 total. We are told that the soft money contributions in the first half of 1999 have increased 55 percent over the same period in 1997, and they are 75 percent higher this year than they were in the first half of 1995. 
   The increases are stunning when we look at specific examples. One corporation contributed $270,000 in soft money contributions in the first 6 months of 1997; it contributed $750,000 in the first 6 months of 1999. One union contributed $195,000 in soft money contributions in the first 6 months of 1997; it has contributed $525,000 in the first 6 months of 1999. 
   Those are the increases we are experiencing. They are out of control. The limits are effectively gone. There are effectively no more limits on contributions that get into campaigns and support candidates. 
   That is not what the Supreme Court said in Buckley. The Supreme Court said in Buckley it is perfectly appropriate for Congress to limit contributions to candidates and to effectuate that by limiting the total contribution to $25,000 a year that could be made overall as a way of implementing, assuring, that the $1,000 contribution would be upheld and not evaded. Yet with the soft money loophole, we have wiped out the $25,000 contribution limitation. For all intents and purposes, there are no more limits on contributions that effectively assist candidates in campaigns. 
   One case was discussed in the 1997 hearings. Roger Tamraz was a large contributor to both parties who became the bipartisan symbol for what is wrong with the current system. Roger Tamraz served as a Republican Eagle during the 1980s during the Republican Administrations and as a Democratic trustee in the 1990s during Democratic Administrations. Tamraz's political contributions were not guided by his views on public policy or his desire to support people who shared those views. He was unabashed in admitting his political contributions were made for the purpose of getting access to people in power. Tamraz showed in stark terms the all too common product of the current campaign finance system--using unlimited soft money contributions to buy access. Despite the condemnation by the press of Tamraz's activities, when asked at the hearing to reflect on his $300,000 contribution to obtain access, Tamraz said: I think next time I'll give $600,000. 
   How do the parties entice wealthy contributors to make large soft money contributions? What they often do is offer access to decision makers in return for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single contribution. The parties advertise access. It is blatant. Both parties sell access for large contributions, and they do it openly. The larger the contribution, the more personal the access to the decision maker. 
   We all know about large contributors to the Democratic National Committee being invited to radio addresses given by the President, or to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom, or to attend one of dozens of coffees with the President at the White House. 
   Look at this invitation to be a DNC trustee. I believe this is from 1996. For $50,000, or if you raise $100,000, the contributor gets two events with the President, two events with the Vice President, ``invitations to join party leadership as they travel abroad to examine current and developing political and economic issues in other countries,'' and monthly policy briefings with ``key administration officials and Members of Congress.'' 
   It is an open sale of access for large contributions. Does anyone want to defend that at a town meeting in our home States? Does anyone want to hold up this invitation from the Democratic National Committee in a town meeting and ask people whether or not they like this system? If any Members who oppose this bill banning soft money think their position is credible with the public, I challenge those Members to go back to a town meeting and hold up this invitation from the Democratic National Committee or from the Republican National Committee and ask our constituents if they think it is right for $50,000 or for $100,000 a year, if they raise it, to get two meetings with the President in Washington, two meetings with the Vice President in Washington, and have annual meetings with policy makers and elected officials in Washington. 
   Take a look at the Republican National Committee's 1997 Annual 
   Gala. For $250,000, one gets breakfast with the Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House and a luncheon with the Republican Senate or House Committee Chairman of your choice. By the way, they get that for $100,000; some of the other perks they don't get. All the way down to, I think $45,000, they get lunch with the Republican Chairman of their choice. 
   How many Members of this body want to take home these invitations, and in a town meeting with a cross section of constituents, hold up that invitation and say, ``is this the way we want to fund campaigns?'' I don't think many Members want to do that.

   Mr. LEVIN. I hope so, but that doesn't answer my point. 
   My point is whether or not we believe for 100,000 bucks we ought to sell access to the President of the United States. That is my question. It is not whether one gets access in other ways. It is whether or not constituents ought to be able to buy, for $100,000, access to the President or have a lunch with the Committee Chairman of their choice. 
   My question is, How many Members opposing the ban on soft money want to take that invitation to a town meeting and justify it? That is my question. There is an answer to it. The answer will come in whether or not any of my colleagues take these invitations to  town meetings and say: Yes, nothing wrong with saying for $100,000 you can have lunch with the Republican Committee Chairman of your choice. 
   Try to sell that to the public back home. I don't think we can. I cannot in Michigan; I won't speak for any other State. 
   That is not what we intended when we put limits on campaign contributions and that is not what the Supreme Court intended in Buckley when they upheld the contributions because they specifically said in Buckley that the $25,000 annual limit on all contributions was intended to avoid evasion of the $1,000 contribution to an individual campaign to make sure they cannot, in effect, give it to a candidate or his or her campaign through a political party. 
   The answer to my question will come in whether or not any of the opponents to the ban on soft money on these large contributions take these invitations home. And I mean both parties. We have a lot of other invitations, too. We will give Members an invitation of their choice and see whether or not they are comfortable going home to their constituents in a town meeting and saying: I'll defend this $100,000 to buy a meeting with the President, or the Vice President, or a Committee Chairman of choice. 
   I don't think Members will. We will find out. I want to hear from any of the opponents of the soft money ban as to whether or not they do take that kind of an invitation home--selling access for large contributions--and defend it at a town meeting. I am interested as to whether or not your constituents say there is nothing wrong with that; that is free speech. 
   That is not what the Supreme Court said in Buckley. They upheld contribution limits as being consistent with the First Amendment. Our institutions in this democracy depend upon the public having confidence in our institutions. When access is sold for a large contribution and someone is told they can have lunch with a Committee Chairman of their choice for $40,000 or a meeting with the President at the White House for $100,000, I think the public is so totally turned off by that kind of flow of money for access that I believe very few will take me up on my challenge to take this invitation back to a town meeting. 
   One invitation in 1997 to a National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee event promised that contributors would be offered ``plenty of opportunities to share [their] personal ideas and vision with'' some of the top Republican leaders and senators. Failure to attend, the invitation said, means that ``you could lose a unique chance to be included in current legislative policy debates--debates that will affect your family and your business for many years to come.'' 
   The letter from the Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee invites the recipient to be a life member of the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle: ``$10,000 will bring you face-to-face with dozens of our Republican Senators, including many of the Senate's most powerful Committee Chairmen.'' It goes on and on. That's access. That's what we're opening offering for sale for large contributions and that's what contributors are often buying. There are dozens of examples.

   Mr. LEVIN. One solicitation offered, for a contribution of $10,000, the choice of ``attending one of 60 small dinner parties, limited in attendance to 20 to 25 people, at the home of a Senator, Cabinet Officer, or senior White House Staff member.'' 
   One offer for the Republican Senatorial Trust said, ``Trust members can expect a close working relationship with all Republican Senators, top Administration officials and other national leaders. Personal relationships are fostered at informal meetings throughout the year in Washington, D.C. and abroad.'' 
   Another solicitation went so far as to say that, ``Attendance at all events is limited.'' Listen to this one, ``Benefits are based on receipts''; ``Benefits are based on receipts.'' You can't pledge money--cash must be in hand for that meeting with the chairman of your choice. That's how blatant these offers to purchase access have become. 
   It is largely because of soft money. The amounts we see on these solicitations, selling access, are not the $1,000 and $2,000 contributions. They are large--$25,000 and $50,000 and $100,000 in soft money contributions. The soft money loophole has increased and intensified the sale of access. 
   Do these large money contributions create an appearance of personal access and improper influence by big contributors? This is what the Supreme Court said in Buckley v. Valeo. I think they answered that question. The Supreme  Court said there is an appearance of corruption that is created from the size of the contribution alone. They didn't even get to the question of the sale of access. They just said that unlimited contributions inherently create an appearance of impropriety. It is inherent in unlimited contributions. That is the Supreme Court answering, I believe, for the American people. The Court in Buckley upheld contribution limits as a reasonable and constitutional approach to deterring, not actual corruption, but the appearance of corruption. This is what the Court said:  
   It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political quid pro quos from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our position of representative democracy is undermined.  
   And then the Supreme Court said this, ``Of almost equal concern''--the Supreme Court is saying:  
   Of almost equal concern to actual quid pro quos is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions....... Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical ..... if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.  
   I want to repeat a few of those words:  
   The impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.......  
   And that, I believe, is what the American people are most deeply concerned about. We, according to the Court, can correct it. 
   The Court went on to say:  
   ..... And while disclosure requirements serve many salutary purposes, Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed.  
   The Buckley Court repeatedly endorses the concept that the issue of contributions without limits, alone, is enough to create the appearance of corruption and to justify the imposition of limits. Selling access in exchange for contributions would only take the Court's concerns and justifications for limits a step further. 
   The Buckley Court also said:  
   Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated.  
   Add to the equation the actual sale of access for a large contribution and you have an even greater ``opportunity for abuse'' and the appearance of corruption.

   Mr. LEVIN. I believe in the view of the American people, and it is a reasonable view which has been sustained by the Supreme Court: Inherent in unlimited campaign contributions, inherent, is an appearance of impropriety which undermines public confidence in our institutions. I believe the same thing. More important, the American people believe the same thing. The timing of it is not the issue. The issue is that the solicitation of unlimited amounts, huge amounts of contributions, and frequently or very often in exchange for access, is inherently inappropriate in a democracy and creates public disrespect and a lack of public support for our democratic institutions. 
   That is, No. 1, my own belief very deeply. I believe the American people believe that very deeply. Most important, though, in addition to what the American people believe, the Supreme Court 
   has directly said that inherent in unlimited contributions is an appearance of impropriety. The Supreme Court has specifically said that in Buckley. When you put on top of that these kind of sales of access for $50,000 and $100,000 to the President or Committee Chairmen around here, you have, it seems to me, made it triply clear what the Supreme Court did not even need to see or find. They did not even look at the access issue. That was not even in Buckley. But it sure adds fuel to the fire, and that fire is a fire which can burn the institutions of this Government. 
   That is my judgment. Maybe a majority of us do not feel that way. But, again, I challenge my good friend from Utah. I challenge him, take home one of these invitations and try a town meeting; $100,000 for a meeting with the President, $50,000 for a meeting with the Committee Chairman of your choice. Give it a try at a town meeting. See what they think about it. 
   I think I know what you will find. Maybe not; I don't represent Utah. I think you will find they would tell my good friend from Utah that this is wrong. This is wrong. Unlimited huge contributions, buying access--which is frequently the case--is wrong. I happen to agree with them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Arizona. 
   Madam President, what these soft money contributions allow the parties to do is many things, but more and more, pay for ads, TV ads, which are claimed to be about issues but in reality are ads to help candidates. 
   I want to look at two ads: A Republican ad and a Democratic ad. They both have the same problem. 
   First, Bob Dole's ad. In this TV commercial, Mr. Dole said: ``We have a moral obligation to give our children in America the opportunity and values of the Nation that we grew up in.''  Then it talks a lot about Bob Dole and his very strong personal qualities. Then it ended by Bob Dole saying, ``It all comes down to values. What do you believe in? What do you sacrifice? And what do you stand for?'' 
   That ad was paid for with soft money contributed by the Republican National Committee. It is viewed as permissible under current law because that ad does not explicitly ask the viewer to vote for or support Bob Dole. It spends its whole time talking positively about his character. 
   If it added four words at the end, which said, ``Vote for Bob Dole,'' it would be treated as a candidate ad, not an issue ad, and would be subject to hard money limits. Any reasonable person looking at that ad at that particular time in the Presidential season would say: It's not an ad about welfare or wasteful spending; it is an ad about why should we elect that particular nominee. 
   Democrats avail themselves of the same loophole. 
   In the 1996 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee ran ads on welfare and crime and the budget which were basically designed to support President Clinton's reelection. 
   At our hearings on campaign finance reform, Harold Ickes was asked about these DNC ads and to the extent to which people looking at the ads would walk away with the message to vote for President Clinton. And here is what Harold Ickes said. And my good friend from Utah, I think, is nodding because I think he remembers this. 
   Harold Ickes was asked: Do you think people looking at these ads would walk away from these ads with the message that they should vote for President Clinton? His answer: ``I would certainly hope so. If not, we ought to fire the ad agencies.'' 
   Those kinds of ads are paid for with soft money--so-called--unregulated, unlimited money. They are not supposed to be candidate ads. 
   So we should not delude ourselves either about what the American people believe this system is all about, and how it is run, and how it sells access for huge contributions. They are not deluded, and we should not be deluded about their feelings about this system. And we should not be deluded about how this money is spent. We should not kid ourselves. 
   People are arguing that unless we can get the entire original bill which was introduced by Senators McCain and Feingold, we should simply not accept half a loaf, which is what the revised version does. And my answer to that simply is this: I would prefer the original McCain-Feingold bill because I think it is important that we not kid ourselves about issue ads, how they are funded, and what their purpose and intent is. But the sponsors of the bill have indicated--and they are very honest, smart people, with tremendous integrity--that we do not have a chance of getting the original McCain-Feingold approach passed, that our best chance of passing a bill with campaign finance reform in it is to try to ban soft money, to close that loophole, to stop parties and candidates from either soliciting, themselves or through their employees, or through their agents, money which is not regulated by law. And I accept that. 
   I think if that is the best we can get, if that is going to be the most we can accomplish, that would be a significant accomplishment. It is not my preference, but it would be a 
   significant accomplishment. 
   I would only say this: To a nation that is hungry for reform, a half a loaf is better than no loaf. I hope that, at a minimum, we will be able to achieve that success this year. 
   The only way we will do it, I believe, is that when people --if they do--filibuster against this approach, against the ban on soft money, that those of us who support this reform not withdraw from the field. 
   The civil rights days proved that the only way to get these very difficult reforms achieved is by telling the filibusterers: You have a right to filibuster. That is your right, and we'll protect it. But we don't have to withdraw because you are filibustering. With voting rights, it took four cloture votes and about 6 weeks before cloture was able to be invoked and voting rights passed. 
   I would hope we would act with the same kind of determination as they did in those days and the same kind of passion as the opponents have against this reform. 
   Finally, I want to close with a tribute to Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD. I know of no two people in this body who have taken an issue as they have and tried as long and as hard as they have to bring this to the fore, to bring this to national attention. They are entitled to the thanks of the Nation for what they are doing. 
   I want to end my remarks with a personal thank you to our two good colleagues for the fight that they are waging on this reform. It cannot happen without them, without their integrity, without their determination. And they have shown it in the past. I am personally very much in their debt. Much more important, the Nation will always be in their debt for the fight they have waged and are waging and will wage for campaign finance reform.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Nevada, and I think everybody who is supporting this cause thanks him for his support of this effort, as well. 
   So, Mr. President, this kind of candidate advertising, which should clearly be subject to contribution limits, escapes those limits through the soft money loophole. And it's that soft money loophole that the two amendments before us would close. 
   Now some of my colleagues argue that if we only close the soft money loophole to political parties, the money we cut off to the parties will be redirected to special interest groups. Well if the Daschle amendment could pass, I would prefer it and I've supported similar proposals for years, because it not only stops the soft money loophole to parties, it stops the use of sham or phony issue ads by third party organizations. But I also say if all we can do is stop soft money to the parties and that money then goes to outside groups, so be it. Candidates and public officials running for reelection won't be raising it, the parties won't be raising it, and the contributors won't be buying access to us with it. This bill would preclude a candidate or office holder from soliciting soft money for private organizations running issue ads. Under this legislation, I couldn't go and solicit money for an outside group to use for issue ads in some campaign. This bill would bar that. Will contributors of these large sums want to buy access to the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association? Perhaps. If so, let them do it. Will they be able to buy access to us through these unlimited contributions to third parties? No. If that were to occur, then it would be in direct violation of the law. Under this soft money ban, public officials and candidates will be out of the soft money fundraising loop, and that's the important step we'll be taking with this legislation. 
   To a nation hungry for reform, a half of loaf is better than no loaf. 
   Mr. President, we've been here before--trying to pass campaign finance reform, trying to stop the explosion of soft money. The question is--will it be different this time? 70% of the American people want campaign finance reform. 70% of the American people want us to clean up our act. We're the only ones who can do it.  
   The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it. 
   It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility for our share of the blame. Congress alone writes the laws. Congress alone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the federal election laws. 
   Mr. President, the Reid amendment closes the biggest loophole in our campaign financing system and it restores that system to what Congress intended in the 1970's--that there should be reasonable limits to what a person can contribute to a candidate, a PAC or a party and that unions and corporations should not be allowed to contribute to either parties or candidates. It's that simple. We had that system in the 1970's; it operated pretty well for many years; soft money has torn apart that system, and the Reid amendment puts it back together. 
   The public is appalled at these huge contributions which buy access to candidates and office holders and fund television ads which are for all intents and purposes about candidates. As the Supreme Court said in Buckley, the appearance of corruption is ``inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions.'' And permitting the appearance of corruption undermines the very foundation of our democracy--the trust of the people in the system. We have the right to protect our democratic institutions from being undermined by the open sale of access for large contributions which people believe reasonably translates into influence. And the greater the purchase price, the greater the perception that access yields influence. 
   Mr. President, we can't afford to give Mr. Tamaraz a next time. We've got to stop this practice of selling access now. And the amendment before us is the way to do it. It is time to enact campaign finance reform. That is our legislative responsibility. Otherwise we will be haunted by the words of Roger Tamraz that in the next election he will give $600,000. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the city of Detroit is grieving over the loss of Cody High School sophomore Darryl Towns, who was fatally shot just days before his sixteenth birthday. Darryl was murdered in his own backyard over a minor dispute that eventually turned into a major tragedy. What started off as a fist fight between life long friends ended up in murder: three fatal shots with a semiautomatic pistol. 
   Now, Darryl's community is left in shock as they grieve over the ``foolish'' and ``senseless'' death of their friend, known among many as a ``respectful,'' ``responsible'' young man. Friends and parents are forced to ask the troubling question: If a person like Darryl, who stayed out of trouble, isn't safe from gun violence, who among our teens is safe? Unfortunately, there is no one who can answer that question or predict the future. Yet, common sense tells us that the widespread proliferation of guns will only result in additional tragedies like Darryl's.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with this fateful vote tonight the world becomes a more dangerous place. That is what our top military leaders are telling us. To quote General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs:  
   The world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it. And it is in our national security interest to ratify the treaty.  
   Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen says that this treaty will ``help cap the nuclear threat.'' 
   Mr. President, we no longer have standing, when we defeat this treaty, to tell China or India or Pakistan or any other country: Don't test nuclear weapons. 
   We will have lost our standing, and I believe will have lost our bearings. By rushing headlong into this vote tonight and defeating a treaty which 150 nations have signed--it was said a few moments ago that our lab Directors say that the treaty would endanger their safety and reliability testing.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Delaware. I thank him also for the leadership he has shown, both on the floor and off the floor, in trying to bring this treaty to hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee, so that the full Senate could look at the pros and cons of this in a deliberative way. 
   I start with a reference that Senator BIDEN made to three of our good allies--France, Germany, and Great Britain. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is here and perhaps he will recollect otherwise; and I would trust his recollection on this, if he does--but I cannot remember when three of our closest allies' leaders have addressed a direct plea to the Senate. At least in the 20 years I have been here, I do not remember a letter coming in from the Chancellor of Germany and the President of France, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain pleading with us to ratify a treaty. That is how serious the stakes are in this debate. 
   The world is looking to the Senate. Sometimes we say that and believe it is true; but in this case we say it and know it is true. Because the world has signed on both to a nonproliferation treaty and to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   There are a few exceptions, obviously. There are some states which will not sign any such treaty. But except for a few rogue nations, the world has signed on to a nonproliferation treaty and a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The world is looking at us, expecting our leadership. 
   Even though the world is looking to us to ratify, that does not mean we should ratify this treaty if it makes us less secure. We should do what is in our security interests. But unless all of our allies and the rest of the world are wrong, the world will be a much more secure place if we stop testing nuclear weapons and if other countries stop testing nuclear weapons as well. 
   How do we tell India ``don't test'', if we ourselves want to test? How do we tell Pakistan, ``don't test; for God's sake, for your security and the world, don't test'', if we say, oh, but we want to continue to test? 
   What does that do to our argument? I would suggest it destroys it. It destroys our standing to try to persuade countries that want to become nuclear powers, that want to add to their inventories, that want to improve their inventories--it wipes out our standing to make the argument, if we say everybody else ought to stop testing but us. 
   We are the only superpower in this world. That gives us certain responsibilities. But one of those responsibilities is that we should be not just a superpower, but we should be superwise as well. We should realize that we are not always going to be the world's only superpower--nuclear or otherwise. We should behave with the realization that our actions today are going to affect the rest of the world, including the direction they go in terms of nonproliferation. 
   As I said, I would not care if every country in the world signed or ratified this treaty if it was not in our security interests. I think we ought to listen, we ought to understand what 
   the rest of the world is saying to us, we ought to remember our own commitments. We signed up to the indefinite extension of the nonproliferation treaty, and made a commitment to the world to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty. We should remember our own commitments. We should consider what our allies and the rest of the world are saying to us. But if it were not in our own security interest, I would not recommend that we ratify the treaty. 
   But we should surely listen to our top military leaders as to what they recommend to this Senate? What does the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend strongly to the Senate? He says:  
   The test ban treaty will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. It is true that the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce current inventories, but it can restrict nuclear weapons progress and reduce the risk of proliferation.  
   General Shelton said:  
   In short, the world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it. And it is in our national security interest to ratify the CTBT.  
   Secretary Cohen said the following:  
   By banning nuclear explosive testing, the treaty removes a key tool that a proliferator would need in order to acquire high confidence in its nuclear weapons designs.  
   Secretary Cohen said:  
   Furthermore, the treaty helps make it more difficult for Russia, China, India, and Pakistan to improve existing types of nuclear weapons and to develop advanced new types of nuclear weapons.  
   Secretary Cohen said:  
   In this way, the treaty contributes to the reduction of the global nuclear threat. Thus, while the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce the current nuclear threat, it can make more difficult the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons and thereby help cap the nuclear threat.  
   What the three world leaders, to whom I referred before and to whom Senator BIDEN referred earlier, said in their article and in their letter to us was the following:  
   Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental divergence within NATO. The United States and its allies have worked side by side for a comprehensive test ban since the days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our grasp. Our security is involved as well as America's. For the security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty. We  have President Chirac, Prime Minister Blair, Chancellor Schroeder of Germany, from their perspective, pleading with us to ratify this treaty. We have our top military leadership, uniformed and civilian, urging us to ratify this treaty. That is the kind of assessment which has been made of the value of this treaty. That is the kind of analysis which has been made.  
   We should think carefully before we reject it; before we defeat a treaty that is aimed at reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world; before we give up our leadership in the fight against proliferation; and our efforts to go after proliferators. We keep saying the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the greatest threat this Nation faces; our military leaders tell us this treaty is an important step in the fight against proliferation. Before we give up that leadership and defeat a treaty which is adding momentum to the battle against proliferators, we surely should stop and assess what it is this Senate is about to do. 
   It has been argued that we need testing for the safety of our stockpile. The answer is that the stewards of the stockpile, the lab Directors, for the last 7 years have been certifying safety and reliability of the stockpile based not on testing, which we have given up for 7 years already, but based on a Stockpile Stewardship Program which has allowed them to certify with a high degree of confidence that our stockpile is safe and reliable, without one test in the last 7 years. 
   Will they be able to do that forever? They think they can, but they are not sure. They told us they believe they will be able to continue to certify the safety and reliability of our stockpile without testing. They have also told us something else. Here I want to read a letter from them because there has been such a misunderstanding about what these three lab Directors have told us at our hearing. After the hearing, they wrote a joint statement from which I want to read:  
   While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing. If that turns out not to be the case, Safeguard F--which is a condition for entry into the Test Ban Treat by the U.S.--provides for the President, in consultation with Congress, to withdraw from the treaty under the standard ``supreme national interest'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.  
   People can quote different parts of the lab Directors' testimony. I was there for it. The bottom line is, while they cannot guarantee that the Stockpile Stewardship Program will always allow them to certify safety and reliability, they believe it will be able to do so, and therefore they are, in the words of one of them, ``signed onto'' this treaty. That is because if they can't certify the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile in some future year they have the assurance in safeguard F, by which we can withdraw from the treaty if we need to conduct a nuclear test. We have incorporated that safeguard and, indeed, strengthened it in the amendment to this resolution, that we will withdraw from this treaty and begin nuclear testing again if necessary. We do not want our stockpile to be unsafe or unreliable. Nobody does--none of us. 
   The question then is, Can we join the rest of the world, at least the civilized world, in a comprehensive test ban to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and at the same time assure ourselves that if we need to test again, we will be able to do so by notifying the rest of the civilized world in advance that we retain the right to withdraw from the treaty and test if our security requires it? In other words, in the event the day comes when testing is needed to certify safety and reliability, we are putting the world on notice now that we intend to exercise that 
   withdrawal clause. 
   Could somebody cheat? That is the other argument which has been used, that somebody could cheat at a very low level of testing, that somebody might be able to get away with it, that our seismic detection capability is not such that we would be certain we would catch a very low level test. 
   This is what Secretary Cohen says about the cheating question:  
   Is it possible for states to cheat on the treaty without being detected? The answer is yes. We would not be able to detect every evasively conducted nuclear test. And from a national security perspective, we do not need to. But I believe that the United States will be able to detect a level of testing, the yield and number of tests, by which a state could undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent.  
   So the Secretary of Defense is testifying that militarily significant cheating would be caught, that a low-level test by a power would be taking a huge risk in cheating, because there are other means besides seismic detection to get evidence of a cheating. But most importantly, if a signatory to this treaty decided to cheat and take that risk, they could not undermine our nuclear deterrent. It would not be a militarily significant cheating that could occur without our knowing it seismically. We would not have to rely on other means in order to discover a militarily significant act of cheating. Plus, General Shelton and Secretary Cohen have both told us that the treaty, if it comes into effect, will increase our ability to observe and monitor tests because it will create over 300 additional monitoring stations in 90 countries specifically in order to detect nuclear testing. 
   I will conclude with two points. One, this Senate is not ready to ratify this treaty. Indeed, maybe it never will ratify the treaty. But it is clear now that this Senate will not ratify the treaty at this time. I believe at a minimum we should do no damage, do no harm. 
   There are many of us who have not focused adequately on these issues, by the way. This has been a very truncated period of time for consideration, with very few hearings focused directly on the treaty. I know we had three hearings in the Armed Services Committee, and there was one in Foreign Relations last week that focused directly on this treaty. 
   We are here under a unanimous consent agreement which allows only one amendment by the majority leader and one by the Democratic leader to this treaty, an unusual restriction for consideration and deliberation of a treaty. No other amendments are in order; no other restrictions, conditions on a resolution of ratification, but the one. So we are here in a very restricted circumstance and a very short time limit. It is not a deliberative way to address a treaty. This Senate should do better. 
   At a minimum, my plea is, do no harm. Do no harm to the cause of antiproliferation. The way to avoid doing harm, regardless of where people think they are on the merits of the treaty, is to delay consideration of this treaty. 
   My final point has to do with the delay issue. There is a precedent for delaying a vote on a treaty even though a vote had actually been scheduled. The precedent is the most recent arms control treaty we looked at, I believe, which is the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was a vote actually scheduled on the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was a vote that was scheduled on the Chemical Weapons Convention for September 12, 1996. Shortly before that vote, Senator Dole, who was then a candidate for President, announced his opposition to the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was decided on the 12th, which I believe was the actual day scheduled by unanimous consent for a vote on the convention, 
   it was decided to vitiate that unanimous consent agreement and to delay the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. A vote was set, by unanimous consent agreement, but given the opposition of one of the Presidential candidates--similar to what we have going on now, by the way, where we have opposing positions taken by Presidential candidates of both parties--it was decided then that it was the wiser course for the Senate to delay the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   I said before on this floor last week that I think we are in an analogous situation to what occurred back in September of 1996. I raise it again for a very specific point. At that time, there were no conditions attached to the decision to delay the vote. The Senate agreed to vitiate the unanimous consent agreement, to delay the vote; but there was no requirement, no condition attached as to when it would be brought up or not brought up. It was simply to vitiate. People decided--we decided in this body--that it was a wiser course of action not to proceed under the circumstances--one similar to what exists now, but there are different circumstances now that are, I think, additional reasons not to vote at  this time, including the very narrow UC under which we are operating, with the strict consideration of a total of two amendments. 
   I suggest we look back--and we are going to do what each of us always does, which is follow our own consciences as to what is best for this Nation. In my judgment, ratification is best, but, clearly, that is not where the Senate is now. I hope there is a majority of us who believe, for various reasons, the better course of wisdom is that we not proceed to defeat this treaty at this time--whether it is because that defeat would constitute a blow to our leadership in the battle against proliferation in this world, as three major allies have told us, or whether it is because this institution has not had adequate time yet to fully understand and consider and deliberate over this very complicated treaty; for whatever reason--and many exist--I hope we will delay this vote. I cannot foresee a circumstance, as I have told my good friend from Virginia, where I would want to see this treaty brought up next year, given the fact that the election is at the end of next year. However, I can't preclude any circumstance from existing. I can't predict every world circumstance that would exist, where I would be comfortable saying we should under no circumstances consider this treaty, no matter what happens. 
   But I can, in good conscience, say I can't foresee any such circumstances because I can't. Will the world situation change? Will India and Pakistan begin testing because we fail to ratify? Will that then lead to China to begin their testing again? Will that have an impact on Russia? Will the political situation change in the United States where candidates of both parties will possibly decide that this treaty is in our best interest? Can I foresee any of that happening? No. Do I believe any of that will happen? No. But it could. 
   Circumstances can change. So I would not want to see us saying there are no circumstances under which anybody could even raise the question of consideration of this treaty next year. It is a very straightforward statement and, again, I conclude by saying, personally, I hope we delay the vote. Personally, I can foresee no circumstances under which this should be brought up next year. We should wait until after the Presidential elections, in the absence of some unforeseeable circumstance. But I hope that is what the Senate, in its deliberative wisdom, decides to do. 
   At this time, I have been authorized to yield 5 minutes to 
   Senator DORGAN. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the conference report on H.R. 1906, the fiscal year 2000 Appropriations Act for Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies. Included in this Act is more than $4 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children commonly known as the WIC program. This is one of the most successful programs provided by the federal government, and I am glad to see that an increase above last year's level is provided in this Act. 
   However, I have concerns about language in the statement of managers to accompany this conference report about the WIC program. This language relates to the so-called ``sugar cap'' and I would like to ask my friend from Wisconsin, the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, about this specific provision.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. I was surprised to learn that language relating to specific nutritional policy of the USDA--policy that has been the subject of significant study and debate within the agency for years--that language which appears to reach a conclusion on the outcome of years of study has been slipped into the fiscal year 2000 appropriations report. This language appeared, deus ex machina, at the very last minute and without discussion by all the conferees. Thankfully, the language is not binding on USDA, so the agency can continue with their  decision making process, without being bound by the language in the conference report. 
   Substantively, the report language conflicts with the USDA's own recommendations on children's diets. When the National Association of WIC Directors and the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion both urge people to add fruit to their cereal, it is irrational and incoherent to deny people the opportunity to obtain fruit in their cereal. But that is what the report language would accomplish. 
   USDA should make a determination on how the sugar cap on breakfast cereals in the WIC package of foods should be calculated and how best to incorporate fruit into WIC participants' diets. The agency should bring nutritional science and common sense to the task, and it should ensure that the rule is consistent with the nutritional recommendations that it makes regarding children's diets.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   I wish to begin also by thanking the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for holding 3 days of hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. These hearings were well balanced and very informative. They were also very much overdue. But at least we have begun the process of exploring this treaty. 
   What do we know after 3 days of those hearings? 
   We know the best professional judgment of our senior military leaders is that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is in our Nation's national security interest. The best professional judgment of our senior military leaders, civilian and uniform, is that we are better off with this treaty than without it. We know after these hearings that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will make it harder and more expensive for other countries to maintain existing stockpiles. We know the treaty would make it harder and more expensive for nations that do not yet have nuclear weapons to develop and deploy those weapons. We know that the treaty, as all treaties, is not perfectly verifiable. But we also know that tests conducted below our level of detection would not militarily disadvantage the United States. 
   That doesn't come from me, although I believe it. It comes from our senior military leaders. 
   We know that our overall monitoring and verification capabilities are very capable today and will improve with the entry into force of the treaty. We know, despite a 7-year moratorium on nuclear testing, that the U.S. nuclear stockpile remains safe and reliable today. We haven't tested in 7 years. We have relied on our Stockpile Stewardship Program. That program is up and running. We rely on it every year for a certification that our stockpile is safe and reliable. 
   This isn't some future concept that is being discussed. It is a Stockpile Stewardship Program that is, of course, not finished. It may never be finished. But it has made significant progress. We rely on it. We have invested billions in it. And our lab Directors have said three times, based on a Stockpile Stewardship Program that we now have up and running, that our nuclear inventory is safe and reliable. Without that stewardship program, they cannot make those certifications now on which we so heavily rely. 
   So the Stockpile Stewardship Program is already serving as a basis for certifying safety and reliability of this stockpile. We also know that its capabilities will improve substantially in the future, but that if at any point in the future the Stockpile Stewardship Program is not adequate to certify the safety and reliability of our stockpile at that point under the guarantees that are in the letter from the President--and that we will write into the ratification resolution--then the United States will exercise its supreme national interest clause and begin testing again. 
   We have informed every signatory that is what we will have the right to do. We have put all the parties on notice as to what our supreme national interest is. We have said that if we can't certificate safety and reliability without testing--and we believe that we can do it without testing--we will then return to testing. 
   We also know there is no military requirement for the United States to resume testing at the present time and there are no plans to resume testing with or without a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Most important of all, we know that if we do not ratify this treaty, we will miss an opportunity, which is a historic opportunity, to stem the tide of nuclear proliferation, and we will instead be encouraging a new and possibly worldwide nuclear arms race. 
   Prohibition of nuclear weapons tests have been the goal of Presidents since President Eisenhower. It was President Eisenhower who said almost 40 years ago that not achieving a nuclear test ban, in his words, ``would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration of any decade of any time and of any party.'' 
   The whole world, including nuclear weapons powers and countries that might want to become nuclear weapons powers, will be watching what the Senate does with this treaty. 
   Our action is going to affect the willingness of other nations to ratify the treaty and our ability to persuade other nations to refrain from future nuclear testing. Rejection of this treaty will have a profound negative impact on the battle against proliferation of nuclear weapons.  
   We urge other countries--particularly, most recently India and Pakistan--to give up nuclear testing, to sign this treaty. India and Pakistan test weapons and we say: Stop it for your sake, for the world's sake. It is a road you should no longer walk. It is a road which could lead to your mutual total destruction and could spread to other parts of the world. 
   We make those pleas to India, Pakistan, and other countries. How in the world can we expect other countries to refrain from nuclear testing if we are unwilling to do so? How will we have any standing to ask India, Pakistan, China, and other countries to stop nuclear testing for the sake of the world, for the sake of our kids, and their kids? How would we have the gall to ask other countries to refrain from testing if we, ourselves, are unwilling to do so? 
   Our Secretary of Defense, our Joint Chiefs, four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs--including General Shalikashvili, General Powell, Admiral Crowe, General Jones--have reviewed this treaty and have told the Senate Armed Services Committee that they also support this test ban treaty. General Shalikashvili's name was brought in by the Senator from Texas. I want to read what General Shalikashvili said this week. We heard what he said 2 years ago; now let's see what he says today. By the way, it is even stronger than where he was leading 2 years ago.  
   In short, the chief and I have supported this treaty, together with the safeguards package, because it answered our military concerns and because our country is better off with this treaty than it is without it.  
   That is General Shalikashvili putting in a nutshell what the issue is: Is this country better off with or without this treaty? His answer is, it is. 
   General Shelton, who is the current Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, testified as follows before our committee:  
   This treaty will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. It is true that the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce current inventory, but it can restrict nuclear weapons progress and reduce the risk of proliferation.  
   In short, our top uniform military official says the world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the treaty. 
   Secretary Cohen, at the same hearings this week, testified that the treaty would restrain other nations from creating and building nuclear arsenals. He said:  
   By banning nuclear explosive testing, the treaty removes a key tool that a proliferator would need in order to acquire high confidence in its nuclear weapons design. Further, the treaty helps make it more difficult for Russia, China, India and Pakistan to improve existing types of nuclear weapons and to develop advanced new types of nuclear weapons. In this way, the treaty contributes to the reduction of the global nuclear threat. Thus, while the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce the current nuclear threat, it can make more difficult the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons and thereby help cap the nuclear threat.  
   Opponents of ratification have raised two major arguments. They contend other nations could cheat because a low-yield nuclear test might not be picked up by our sensors; and second, we need to conduct nuclear tests in order to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. 
   General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, on the basis of current intelligence information, have said that we would be able to detect any militarily significant level of nuclear testing. Secretary Cohen explained the conclusion this way:  
   Is it possible for States to cheat on the treaty without being detected? The answer is, yes. We would not be able to detect every evasively conducted nuclear test, and from a national security perspective we do not need to.  
   This is his conclusion. 
   Secretary Cohen said:  
   I believe that the United States will be able to detect a level of testing, the yield and the number of tests by which a state could undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent.  
   General Shelton also pointed out that the treaty, if it comes into effect, will increase our ability to observe and monitor tests because it will create an international monitoring system of over 300 monitoring stations in 90 countries. 
   Some refer to information developed by the intelligence community over the last 18 months. I specifically asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense whether or not their testimony, their opinion, includes consideration of all of the intelligence community's information that has been gathered in the last 18 months and before. 
   Secretary Cohen states:  
   I have been apprised of all the developments. I am not aware of any information at this point that would call into question our ability to maintain our strong nuclear deterrent, that any balance has shifted or would call into question our ability to defend ourselves.  
   With regard to the safety of the stockpile, it is now safe, it is certified as safe, even though we have done no testing since 1992. 
   The answer of the heads of our laboratories--when I directly asked them this question: Are you signed on to this treaty?--was:  
   Yes, provided the safeguards are written into the ratification resolution and providing there is robust funding of our safeguards and our stockpile security program.  
   The lab Directors are, in the words of one of them, ``on board'' under those conditions and those conditions now exist. 
   My friend from Virginia apparently has a question, and I yield.

   On September 22, 1997, President Clinton submitted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban (CTB) Treaty to the United States Senate for its advice and consent, together with six Safeguards that define the conditions under which the United States will enter into this Treaty. These Safeguards will strengthen our commitments in the areas of intelligence, monitoring and verification, stockpile stewardship, maintenance of our nuclear laboratories, and test readiness. They also specify the circumstances under which the President would be prepared, in consultation with Congress, to exercise our supreme national interest rights under the CTB to conduct necessary testing if the safety or reliability of our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified.  
   This is his conclusion, General Powell, on January 27, 1998:   
   With these Safeguards, we support Senate approval of the CTB Treaty.

   Mr. LEVIN. I am not going to comment on his reasons. I am delighted he reached the conclusion he did. I disagree with his reasoning as to how he reached his conclusion because I think the evidence is overwhelming, and the testimony, if anything, has grown stronger. In fact, one of the arguments against this treaty is that we need somehow to defeat it in order to protect our allies; that they are relying on our deterrent--which, of course, they are--that somehow or other our allies would be disadvantaged if we ratified this treaty. 
   Yet three key allies have taken an unusual step. I do not remember when this has ever happened, when the heads of three states closely allied with us have urged this Senate directly to ratify a treaty. Yet that is what they are now doing. 
   We have heard arguments for the last few days: Look how important our strategic deterrent is, not just to us, which it is, but to our allies, which it has been and will continue to be. 
   What does President Chirac say and what does Prime Minister Blair say and what does Chancellor Schroeder say? They say: We need this treaty, Senate. They are directly addressing the U.S. Senate. I do not remember that ever happening.

   Mr. LEVIN. Directly, directly asking the U.S. Senate to ratify the comprehensive test ban. 
   What do they say:  
   Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental divergence within NATO. 
   The United States and its allies [they say] have worked side by side for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since the days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our grasp. Our security is involved as well as America's. For the security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty.  
   So much for the argument that somehow or other defeating this treaty is not only good for us but it is good for our allies. Not in their view, it is not. Not in my view, it is not. And I hope not in the view of the majority of this Senate. 
   But I want to go back to the delay, and I am going to wind up because I do happen to agree, we should not vote on this 
   treaty at this time--for a number of reasons. 
   First of all, because it would be tragic to reject this treaty, and if it comes to a vote now, it is going to be rejected. It would be tragic for our security--that is our top military leaders saying that, and I feel that keenly. It would be tragic for the world for us to defeat this treaty. It would reverse the direction in which we are heading, which is an ongoing effort to try to reduce the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons. That effort, which I hope all of us share, will be damaged severely if we reject this treaty. And because we will reject this treaty if it comes to a vote, I think we should delay it. 
   No. 2, this treaty should not be involved in any way in Presidential politics, partisan politics, political meanderings, conflicts. We ought to be looking at this treaty based on its merits without this political environment being heeded. We cannot and are not doing that at this moment. It is a good reason to delay this treaty. 
   We delayed the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason we delayed our vote, even though it was scheduled--and I tell my good friend who is presiding, even though we had actually scheduled a vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention, by unanimous consent I believe, too--when Senator Dole came out against that Chemical Weapons Convention shortly before we were voting, and while he was running for President, we decided as a Senate we would delay that vote until after that Presidential election. 
   We then, taking calm deliberation, adding conditions, reservations--we then ratified that treaty. We took the time to do it. In fact, we spent a lot of time in the Old Senate Chamber, as I remember, as part of that deliberation. We should do that here. 
   The third reason we should not proceed to vote at this time is that we as a Senate have a responsibility to deliberate on a treaty. We put ourselves in a position, through a unanimous consent agreement, where we could not do that adequately. I think that was a mistake. But we do not have to compound our mistakes and make a worse mistake by voting on it just because we agreed to a unanimous consent agreement that we would begin the debate on it. That does not force us to proceed to vote on that treaty. 
   We have done some good with this unanimous consent agreement already, although I believe, looking back, it was a mistake to constrain ourselves as we did--that we could not add amendments other than one on each side, could not add reservations, could not add conditions, and so forth. What we have done as an institution is to put ourselves in a straitjacket with this unanimous consent reservation, which is not in keeping with the great traditions of the Senate. Senator BYRD, Senator MOYNIHAN, and others made that point. I think they made it eloquently. I keenly believe it. We have a responsibility here to deliberate on a treaty, to be open to considering conditions, qualifications, reservations, statements--to complete our committee work. 
   My good friend from Virginia knows--in fact he was the one, I think, who brought this out--we are currently in the middle of receiving a national intelligence estimate which is not yet completed. We should see that completed. We should have whatever hearings are needed. 
   By the way, we should have a committee report. I cannot remember a treaty which has ever come to the floor of the Senate--at least of this magnitude--without a committee report. On the Chemical Weapons Convention, we had a committee report of 350 pages for consideration by this body. We do not have one page from any of the committees. 
   So it seems to me it makes the most sense for us, under these circumstances--I am going to be perfectly candid; one of the reasons that compels me is that I believe if we voted now, this would be defeated. I think that would be a tragic setback in the fight against proliferation. But there are other very important institutional reasons, which I hope will appeal to others, that we should not ever as a body put ourselves in a position where we need to vote, or have to vote, on something which is not ready to be voted on.

Bringing this treaty up now for a vote--not for debate, which we are doing under a UC, but for a vote--in my judgment, would do harm to the battle against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I hope we will be able to find a way that we not reach that vote. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. I would like to describe this amendment and why it is so necessary. Our amendment concerns Heartland Manor, a nursing home located in Flint, Michigan, that provides care to an underserved population. Heartland Manor is not out to make money--it is owned by the Hurley Foundation which is not for profit 501(c)(3) subsidiary of Hurley Medical Center. Hurley Medical Center is a not for profit public hospital with an excellent reputation. Hurley Medical Center is one of the few city owned hospitals left in the country, and it is the largest hospital in Flint, Michigan. 
   On July 27, 1989, Chateau Gardens, a privately owned nursing home facility, was terminated from the Medicare program. On January 1, 1994, Hurley Foundation, a not for profit 501(c)(3) subsidiary of Hurley Medical Center, purchased Chateau Gardens at the request of the state. In 1994 Heartland Manor applied for certification into the Medicare program as a new or prospective provider. Heartland Manor had never before entered into a Medicare participation agreement and had never been issued a provider number. However, HCFA treated Heartland as a re-entry provider and Heartland was subsequently denied participation into the Medicare program based in large part on violations which HCFA carried over from Chateau Gardens, the previous owner. If Heartland Manor had been treated as a new provider, it would 
   have been approved and would presently be in the Medicare program. 
   This amendment would allow the facility to come into the Medicare program as a prospective provider which is exactly how the facility should be treated. 
   Heartland Manor has the backing of Citizens for Better Care, a nonprofit agency, funded by the United Way, which monitors nursing home care in Michigan. Moreover, the Mayor of Flint, Woodrow Stanley, the Congressman representing Flint, Representative DALE KILDEE, and State Senator BOB EMERSON all want to keep this nursing home open. These organizations and I wouldn't all be supportive of the facility if this nursing home were not meeting the needs of the Flint community. 
   I have visited Heartland manor and I believe that it should not be closed. I would not make such a bold assertion if I could not honestly say that this is a nursing home that has made great strides in recent years and which is now providing an important service to the Flint community. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this amendment is part of any Medicare BBA package.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, students at Erickson Elementary School and Willow Run High School are mourning the deaths of their peers. On Sunday afternoon, gun fire cut short the lives of two young boys in Ypsilanti Township. Sixteen year old Ernest Earl Lemons was shot in plain daylight, after a fight broke out between young people. Nine year old Cullen Ethington, who was a half a block away, was also killed by a stray bullet from that fight. 
   Both young people are now being remembered by their classmates and teachers. The tree where Lemons fell,  after he was shot, is now decorated with teddy bears. Students at Erickson are planning to plant a tree or flowers in honor of the short life of fourth grader Cullen Ethington, who will be memorialized by his classmates as a peer mediator who helped students resolve their disputes without violence. 
   School children are too often the victims of senseless gun violence. Gun violence results in injury and death, destroys families, and causes lasting psychological and emotional harm. In Michigan, each school is now forced to handle the trauma of children losing other children to gunfire. As many other school districts now know, violence and the fear of violence is not only tragic for individuals and families involved, it also interferes tremendously with the educational process. Students at Erickson, for example, are now spending time at school with trauma teams learning how to cope with death while their peers at other schools are learning about the pilgrims and practicing for the school play. 
   Congress must act now to end the proliferation of gun violence. Like young Cullen, we must not only make a pledge to live our lives without violence, but must also send a message to others that violence is never the answer. 
   My thoughts and prayers go out to the both the Ethington and the Lemons families.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a new exhibit of artifacts from the SS Wayne Victory. The exhibit, which is located at Wayne State University in my home town of Detroit, MI, is being dedicated on Friday, October 8, 1999. 
   The SS Wayne Victory was a so-called ``Victory Ship,'' one of several hundred ships built during the final two years of World War II to serve as cargo and troop transport vessels. The SS Wayne Victory was named for Wayne University, now known as Wayne State University. Commissioned in 1945, the SS Wayne Victory served in World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam war. 
   Thanks to the efforts of a Wayne State University alumnus, the contributions of the SS Wayne Victory to our armed forces will be celebrated for years to come. Many ships of its kind fell into disuse and were forgotten after their service. Fortunately, Joe Gerson, who grew up in Detroit and graduated from Wayne State University in 1951, located the SS Wayne Victory and negotiated with the federal government for the permanent loan of several artifacts from the ship to the university. These artifacts include the ship's bell, engine order telegraph, wheel, furniture, oars, life rings, and name board. Mr. Gerson also generously contributed funds which allowed the university to transport the artifacts to Detroit and to display them in the permanent exhibit being dedicated this Friday. 
   Mr. President, the preservation of artifacts like those from the SS Wayne Victory is critical if we are to continue to learn from history. Thanks to Joe Gerson and Wayne State University, one small, but significant, piece of American military history will be available for people to study in the 21st century. I know my colleagues join me in extending Joe Gerson and Wayne State University our thanks and congratulations for their commitment to the preservation of the memory of the SS Wayne Victory's role in some of the most significant military conflicts in our nation's history.

   Mr. LEVIN. 
   Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my distinguished colleague Senator AKAKA, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 1999. 
   This legislation concerns Federal employees who are under a court order to provide health insurance to their dependent children. If a Federal employee is under such a court order and his dependent children have no health insurance coverage, the Federal government would be authorized to enroll the employee in a ``family coverage'' health plan. If the employee is not enrolled in any health care plan, the Federal government would be authorized to enroll the employee and his or her family in the standard option of the service benefit plan. The bill would also prevent the employee from canceling health coverage for his dependent children for the term of the court order. 
   This bill would close a loophole created by the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. The 1993 bill required each State to enact legislation requiring an employer to enroll a dependent child in an employee's group health plan when an employee is under a court order to provide health insurance for his or her child but neglects to do so. This legislation simply provides Federal agencies with the same authority granted to the states.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act. 
   I have traveled around my State of Michigan and I have heard from all types of health care providers. I consistently hear one message: all health care providers, big and small, are reeling from the cuts mandated under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA). 
   When Congress passed the BBA, it was estimated that it would save $112 billion in Medicare expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office has reestimated those savings at $206 billion. It is clear that the BBA has gone further than we intended. 
   This bill addresses some of the problems the health care community is facing. The bill provides some measure of relief to providers by committing $20 billion dollars towards addressing some of the BBA problems. 
   Here are some of the bill's provisions: 
   Medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments for their reasonable costs, subject to some limits and fee schedules. To create incentives for efficient care, the BBA included a prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital outpatient departments. HCFA expects to implement this system in July 2000. When implemented, it is expected to reduce hospital outpatient revenues by 5.7 percent on average. Michigan hospitals have told me that this payment system will reduce annual hospital payments for out patient services by $43 million for Michigan hospitals. 
   This bill would protect all hospitals from extraordinary losses during a transition period. Each hospital would compare its payments under the PPS to a proxy for what the hospital would have been paid under cost-based reimbursement. In the first year, no hospital could lose more than 5% under the new system. This percentage would increase to 10% in the second year and 15% in the third year. 
   Prior to the BBA, a hospital's inpatient payments increased by 7.7% if the hospital had one intern or resident for every 10 beds. This percentage was cut to 7.0% in 1998, and phased down to be set permanently at 5.5% by 2001. This bill freezes Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments at the current level of 6.5% for 8 years. 
   Due to concern that Medicare+Choice managed care plans were not passing along payments for Graduate Medical Education (GME) to teaching hospitals, the BBA carved out payments for GME and IME from Medicare + Choice rates and directed them to those hospitals. However, the carve out was phased in over several years. This bill contains a provision that would speed up the carve-out, ensuring that teaching hospitals get adequate compensation for the patients they serve. 
   Teaching hospitals are critically important to Michigan. There are 58 teaching hospitals in Michigan, which constitutes one of the nation's largest GME programs. 
   The BBA reduced disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments by 1% in 1998, 2% in 1999, 3% in 2000, 4% in 2001, and 5% in 2002. This bill would freeze the cut in disproportionate share payments at 2% for 2000 through 2002. 
   The BBA created a prospective payment system (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities. There has been a concern that the PPS may not adequately account for the costs of high acuity patients. This bill includes a number of provisions to alleviate the problems facing skilled nursing facilities. Importantly, this bill repeals the arbitrary $1500 therapy cap that was mandated under the BBA. 
   The BBA mandated a 15% cut to home health payments. Last year Congress delayed this cut to October 2000. Our bill would further delay this 15% cut for two years. In addition, our bill creates an outlier policy to protect agencies who serve high cost beneficiaries. 
   The BBA phased out cost based Medicaid reimbursement for rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers but did not replace it with anything to assure that these clinics would be adequately funded. Our bill creates a new system for clinic payments. 
   In summary, these provisions are vitally important to the health care community of Michigan, both providers and beneficiaries. We cannot afford to allow our health care system, the best in the world, to decline.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the University of Michigan Medical School as it celebrates its 150th Anniversary. On October 1, 1999, its faculty, staff, alumni, students and friends will gather to celebrate the Medical School's distinguished history and reputation. 
   Since its founding in 1850, the men and women of the University of Michigan Medical School have been pioneers in the practice of medicine. With over 18,260 M.D. degrees awarded since the first graduating class in 1851, the Medical School's alumni and faculty have left an indelible mark on the course of medical history. With leading roles in the field trials of the Salk polio vaccine, pioneering cancer treatments, innovative uses of new technology in medicine and much more, it has greatly impacted the health of our entire nation. 
   In addition, the University has a remarkably long list of innovative firsts. It opened the nation's first university-owned hospital in 1869, the first department of pharmacology in 1891, the first university-operated psychiatric hospital in 1906, the first children's psychiatric hospital and the nation's first Human Genetics Department. It has been an impressive century and a half indeed. 
   According to statistics recorded by the Center for Disease Control, in the last century alone, the average life expectancy has increased nearly 30 years, from approximately 47 years in 1900 to more than 76 years today. Medical advances have not only added years to the lives of Americans, but have also added quality to those years. Among those leading the way to longer and healthier lives have been the faculty and alumni of the University of Michigan Medical School. The value of their contributions to the practice of medicine in America over the past 150 years is incalculable, and I am confident that they will continue to be on the cutting edge of medicine advances in the 21st century. 
   Mr. President, the faculty, staff, alumni and students of the University of Michigan Medical School can take pride in their many important achievements of the School's first 150 years. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting the accomplishments of the Medical School's first century and a half and in wishing it continued success for the future.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the dedication of the Second Temple period Triple Gate Monumental Stairs and Observation Plaza which will take place this weekend in Jerusalem. This is a new site in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park which has been developed by the Israel Antiquities Authority, focusing on the southern wall of the Temple Mount Enclosure. This restoration project has been dedicated and supported by Dorothy Davidson Gerson and Byron Gerson in loving memory of Sarah and Ralph Davidson. The dedication ceremony for Gerson Observation Plaza will take place on Sunday, October 3 and will be attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert among many others. 
   The Triple Gate and the Double Gate, also known as the Huldah Gates, were a key entrance to the Temple Mount for pilgrims during biblical times. This area of the southern wall was badly damaged following the destruction of the Second Temple. The western Huldah Gate, or Double Gate, now lies below the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The eastern Huldah Gate, or Triple Gate, consisted of three arched entryways at the time of the Second Temple. Now parts of the threshold and the doorjamb are all that remain of the Triple Gate. In front of the Triple Gate was once a monumental staircase. Much of this staircase has now been reconstructed affording visitors the opportunity to envision the southern entrances to the Temple Mount during the Second Temple period. 
   This important archaeological restoration effort would not have been possible without the generous support of Dorothy Davidson Gerson and Byron Gerson. They have made possible an extraordinary view of an ancient treasure which has transcendent meaning. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this historic event and thanking Dorothy Davidson Gerson and Byron Gerson for their extraordinary efforts.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week in Michigan, a coalition of members in the House of Representatives introduced a comprehensive package of gun safety legislation. The principal sponsors of this package are State Representatives Laura Baird, Gilda Jacobs and Samuel Thomas II, three leaders in the state of Michigan on making our state safer for children. 
   The legislation introduced in the Michigan State House is designed to keep kids alive in Michigan and safe from gun violence. It would create gun-free zones in areas such as schools, day care centers, churches, libraries, hospitals and sports arenas; make Michigan the eighteenth state to enact a child access prevention law, requiring that trigger locks be sold with handguns; close the gun show loophole by requiring that unlicensed dealers be subject to the same standards as licensed dealers; and limit individuals to one handgun purchase a month. 
   This legislation, if enacted, would make Michigan one of the most responsible gun safety states in the country. By taking firearms out of the hands of minors and closing loopholes that permit criminals easy access to weapons, Lansing will send a clear message to Michigan mothers and fathers that the state is acting to protect children from gun violence. 
   This legislation is a far cry from the legislation the Michigan Legislature moved forward with last spring. That NRA-backed legislation, designed to loosen the state's law on carrying concealed handguns sailed through the state Legislature only to be rejected by the citizens of Michigan. Michigan's citizens demanded that their lawmakers, enforce stricter, not looser laws, when it comes to gun safety and the protection of their children. The people in Michigan united to reject that bill last spring and I hope they will again unite to seek action from their lawmakers, and urge them to pass this important legislation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his eloquent leadership and his determination to keep this issue of affordable housing in front of us. We have 5 million American households that have either inadequate or unaffordable housing. We have 2 million of those families with children, and 1 million of them are seniors. 
   Each one of our communities is faced with this kind of a shortfall. We have a waiting list of over 1 million people for the vouchers, and this amendment will add a few. 
   There are three realities about which we are talking. One is a reality out on the street. That is the reality which millions of families face that do not have affordable housing or adequate housing. We have a budget reality which is driven by allocations through our appropriations subcommittees. This subcommittee has labored mightily to see what it could do with a very inadequate--totally inadequate--allocation. It has done an amazingly good job in fighting for at least a reasonably adequate number. 
   I commend the chairman and the ranking member of this subcommittee for what they have done, for the fight they have waged. It has been a long fight, and I know it has been a hard fight. They were shorted severely at the beginning and less severely now.  Nonetheless, they have been shorted, and that means America has been shorted. 
   The third reality is the conference, and that is the reality to which the Senator from Massachusetts made reference in closing. In supporting his effort to add back half of the vouchers which were requested by the administration for section 8, I can only add my voice, far less eloquently than his, to the hope that our chairman and our ranking member in conference will strive to find a way to do some justice for section 8 housing this year. Again, I thank him and thank both of our floor managers.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about President Clinton's veto of the Republican-sponsored $792 billion tax cut. I commend the President for vetoing this bill because it would have taken us down the wrong path: 
   The path to huge budget deficits; 
   The path to higher interest rates; and 
   The path that fails to protect Medicare and Social Security; 
   In vetoing this bill, the President has taken us down the fiscally responsible path toward: 
   Paying down the $5.7 trillion national debt; 
   Lowering interest rates and continuing our economic growth; and 
   Protecting Medicare and Social Security in anticipation of the baby boom generation. 
   Republicans claim the projected surplus over the next ten years is large enough to give taxpayers a $792 billion tax cut and still make $500 billion worth of investments in domestic priorities. 
   They claim that there is an estimated $1.4 trillion worth of surplus funds available for tax breaks and whatever else needs attention. 
   But their surplus projection is based on a fantastic, unrealistic, and unwise assumption about domestic discretionary spending: It is based on the assumption that Congress will enact drastic cuts in domestic services over the next ten years . 
   The New Republican Baseline is the amount of Total Discretionary Spending over the next ten years as figured by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of Senator DOMENICI. It is the level of spending that Senator DOMENICI said on the Senate floor on July 29, 1999 would allow for the Republican tax cut and $505 billion to be added back. It was also posted on the Budget Committee Website. 
   This proposal assumes that Congress will cut discretionary spending in accord with the budget caps through 2002 and then freeze discretionary spending at 2002 levels for the years 2003 through 2009. 
   In other words, while the price of a home, car, food goes up; while the cost of health care and tuition go up, the level of domestic services such as Head Start, student loans and economic development grants remains frozen in nominal dollars. 
   A freeze in nominal dollars means a decrease in real dollars. So the Republicans are proposing real, severe cuts in domestic services in order to make their tax cut seem feasible. 
   Huge cuts--tens of billions of dollars below current 1999 levels--are totally unrealistic (and a bad idea). 
   This chart shows that the Republican proposed reductions in domestic services defy history. 
   This chart shows the trend in domestic discretionary services over the last 15 years (in terms of actual outlays) in real 1999 dollars. 
   The trend--(regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans controlled Congress) is upward--and sharply upward over the last ten years--during a period of serious efforts to reign in spending. 
   Looking forward, the trend (on which the Republican tax cut and proposed investments in domestic priorities are based) is sharply downward with domestic services slashed by over a third by the year 2009. 
   A reversal in domestic discretionary services of this size just won't happen--and it shouldn't happen--we shouldn't slash head start, and Pell grants, and community development block grants, and safe drinking water programs by tens of billions of dollars over the next ten years. And history tells us we won't. 
   The current budget process tells us we won't: Newspaper editorials across the country are chiding Congress for already having spent next year's surplus. 
   I support the President's veto because it recognizes our collective responsibility to get America's fiscal house in order and because the Republican tax cut plan and the assumptions that underlie it are unwise, unrealistic and would have squandered this historic opportunity. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the chart to which I referred.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is very interesting that we have had such a focus on Congress having the power rather than the bureaucracy having the power. Many of us worked very hard in this body, including, I believe, the Senator from Texas, to make sure Congress would have the power to review regulation and to review rules. We have a Congressional Accountability Act. It is pretty new. We do not use it very often, but it is there. For 60 days after the Interior Department adopts a rule, if we will let them adopt the rule, we have the power to override that rule by expedited procedure. 
   So if my good friend from Texas really wants Congress to be in the position that we can override the rule if we ever permit the rule to be adopted, we have that power. We worked hard to get that power in law. It took us many years to get that power in law. It is called congressional accountability, congressional review, and the rulemaking process that the Interior Department is following is a rulemaking process that we told them to follow. We are not going to let them finish it, apparently. The argument we now hear is we are not going to let them finish it because we have the power. We should have the power, not the bureaucracy.  
   The problem with that argument is it ignores the fact that if we did let them finish, which we should, their rulemaking process, we would have the power to override a rule of the Department of the Interior. For 60 days we have expedited procedures that will permit us to override their rule. So that argument does not wash. 
   The part of this that really intrigues me the most is what 
   so-called integrated oil companies have been able to get away with by basically setting their own prices instead of using market price. I was really intrigued by this. I was not into this issue until a few months ago, really. I started reading some editorials. I started reading the congressional speeches here in the Senate of Senator BOXER and others. 
   I asked the Interior Department. I said: Can you give me some examples where you have an integrated oil company and an independent oil company that are drilling the same oil from public lands and paying us different royalties; where the price they are setting in an integrated company on the one hand, and an independent company on the other hand, are different for the same oil from adjacent lands, both being public lands, of course? Because then, if you have different prices being set for the same oil, you have overwhelming evidence that we are being cheated. Either that or the independents are paying more than they should, which is a pretty unlikely thing because they are going by the market price. They are going by what they get for the oil in an arm's length transaction. 
   So on the one hand, you have independents with an arm's length transaction, which is what the law is. Then we have the integrateds coming along, saying the prices are going to be a lot different based on what they are charging themselves. 
   So I asked the Department of the Interior to take a look at areas on public lands where you have independents and integrated oil companies right next to each other drilling for the same oil. Is there a price differential? 
   Here are the numbers they give me. It is to me powerful evidence that we are being cheated because from the same lease, the same oil field, the same oil, in 6 months in 1999, we get different prices, and in every case the price that is being set by the integrated company is less than the market price which was established by the independent in its arm's length transaction. 
   How do we justify this? How does an integrated company justify that? In January 1999, three different fields: Colorado, New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. Sales price, dollars per barrel, the independent: $12.43. That was the market price. That was the price they were paid on the market for that oil. The same lease, same oil field, same oil the integrated company is basing their royalty to us on: $11.83. 
   February, the independent, arm's length transaction, getting $11.97 and paying a royalty based on that. What does the integrated company base its royalty on? When it sells it to itself: $11.36. 
   March of 1999, Colorado, same lease, same field, same oil in terms of quality, you have the same oil. The independent, he is basing the royalty to us on $14.60. The integrated company is basing its royalty to us on $14.08. 
   April, same story; May, same story; June, same story. That's Colorado, 
   the first 6 months of 1999. 
   I asked them to give me some examples. I told them not to pick and choose; give me examples which are typical examples where you have oil sales, same lease, same field, same quality oil next to each other. That is in what I am interested. 
   This is the New Mexico field. It has the same kind of price structure. The independent sells it for $11.74. The integrated company is paying us on $9.83. 
   In February, New Mexico, the independent company paid, arm's length transaction, $11.53. The integrated company is basing a royalty to us on $10.16. 
   Something is fundamentally wrong here. The Senator from California and others, it seems to me, have demonstrated in a very clear, dramatic fashion that something is wrong, but when you break it down and ask the Interior Department to give us some more evidence, give us evidence of the differences in the amount on which royalties are based, where the field is the same field, where the lease is the same field--these are public lands. This oil does not belong to the oil companies; it belongs to the people of the United States. They are on our land. This is not a tax; it is a royalty for our property. We own it. It is ours and we let the oil companies drill on it. 
   What did they come up with? Gulf of Mexico, same field, same lease, the independent company, arm's length transaction gets $11.19. The integrated company, selling to itself, is basing its royalty on $10.49. There is a lot of evidence of these miscalculations by these integrated companies so they pay less royalties. 
   What could be more compelling evidence when you have oil being drawn from the same field, the same lease right next to each other on a public land? How much more compelling evidence do we need before we finally say to the Interior Department: Go ahead, do your rule. 
   In closing, I remind our colleagues of one other thing and it is where I started. What we hear from the Senator from Texas is we should do this, not the bureaucracy. We have the power to override the bureaucracy under this new process which so many of us worked so hard to put in place so we are accountable, not the bureaucracy. It used to be called legislative review. Before that, we thought we had a legislative veto, but that was overridden by the Supreme Court. Now it is called the Congressional Accountability Act. For 60 days, if we will let the Interior Department follow the process, we then have the power, under expedited procedures, to override any final rule they may adopt. 
   This effort is to truncate that, to cut it off so they cannot follow the rulemaking process. That is what this effort is all about. 
   What it will stop is the elimination of this absurdity. It is absurd for the same oil, for the same field to be charged at different amounts. It is obvious what is going on. The independent companies, because they are selling on the market, have a very clear objective, outside way of determining market value.

   Mr. LEVIN. That is what is happening. What the Interior Department has done for me at my request is to take a look at situations, as the Senator from California said, where we have oil being drilled under the same lease, the same field so we know it is the same quality oil, next to each other by two different companies, one of which is the 5 percent, the integrated company which is setting its own price, and the other by one of the independents, and to compare the market prices which are set on which the royalty is based. 
   I told them to give me typical examples. Do not pick and choose. Give me typical examples. The typical examples are on the chart. They show a range of differences in sale prices from 10 cents minimum to $2.99 per barrel. When you put that over the entire country for one company, you come up with this kind of a situation where you have a market price the independents are paying and then you have a posted price by an integrated company, which is below that consistently. 
   It is wrong, and we have to end it. The Senator from California is leading an effort to end that. We ought to permit the Interior Department to complete its rulemaking process, and then, if a majority of this Congress thinks they have not done this properly, we have a way to override it. We are the final determinants, not the bureaucracy, and we have that power. 
   We, obviously, do not want to see what this will result in because some of us very clearly want this situation to continue. It is an unfair situation to the taxpayers. It is discriminatory against companies that pay royalties, by the way, based on arm's length market price setting. It is not even fair to them. It is not fair to the States that also get part of these resources. 
   We are not talking about a tax. This is not a business or an individual being taxed. This is oil that is owned by the public. 
   The business is owned by an individual. It is a private business. The oil being drilled is publicly owned oil. So there is a major difference between this and a tax.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that the Senate majority leader brought up the bankruptcy reform bill and then immediately filed for cloture on the bill. If this week's cloture motion had passed, debate would have been blocked and relevant amendments designed to reform the bankruptcy system would have been prohibited from being offered. 
   I was planning to offer an amendment that would have prevented one abuse of the bankruptcy system. My amendment was very straightforward. It would have prohibited manufacturers, distributors and dealers of firearms from discharging debts which are firearm related incurred as a result of judgments against them based on fraud, recklessness, misrepresentation, nuisance, negligence, or product liability. 
   Currently, under the Bankruptcy Code, such persons and companies are able to evade responsibility and ``take advantage of the system.'' That's what Lorcin Engineering Co., a manufacturer of cheap handguns, told Firearms Business it was doing when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996. At the time, Lorcin was one of the chief manufacturers of ``Saturday Night Specials'' or ``junk guns'' and in 1998, their inexpensive semiautomatic pistol was number two on the list of guns traced to crime scenes by ATF. Lorcin's low quality guns, which caused innumerable deaths because of their cheap construction and easy availability, were the basis of more than two dozen product liability lawsuits. Once Lorcin decided they could not defend their practices against the multiple liability claims filed against them, they decided to protect themselves by using the bankruptcy system to settle these lawsuits for pennies on the dollar and be exempted from an additional lawsuit filed by the city of New Orleans. 
   Lorcin was able to evade judgments by filing for bankruptcy, and other manufacturers are lining up in bankruptcy court to follow their lead. Davis Industries, another manufacturer of Saturday Night Specials, has also sought refuge in bankruptcy court, perhaps hoping to dismiss the wrongful-death and personal injury suits filed against them by individuals and the multiple lawsuits filed against them by local governments. 
   Currently, there are eighteen categories of debt that are nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. The Code makes certain debts nondischargeable when there is an overriding public purpose. One specific example is the nondischargeability of debt incurred by a debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated. This addition to the Bankruptcy Code demonstrates Congress' unwillingness to allow debtors to escape debts created by illegal and improper conduct. Debts for death or personal injury resulting from unsafe firearms and their negligent distribution should also be nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. Like debts incurred by drunk driving, Congress must send a message that it will not permit debtors to escape debts incurred by improper conduct.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank again the very able, very distinguished chairman of our committee for the bipartisan approach with which he leads our committee. It has been a consistent pattern for him since he has been in the Senate. We came here together, so we have a lot of knowledge and awareness of each other. He has really made an extraordinary contribution to this body and to the well-being of the Nation. I commend him for it. 
   This bill is an important bill. It is really two bills. It is the Department of Defense bill, an authorization bill, but it is also a Department of Energy reorganization bill. It is the second bill that is the troubling one. I have resolved to vote for this bill because I believe, on balance, it is at least possible that the reorganization can be workable and that the Secretary of the Department of Energy will be able to manage the Department and we will be able to hold him accountable. I am going to go into that a little more in a few moments, but before I do, I want to talk a bit about the Department of Defense part of this bill because, as the chairman says, this is a very important contribution to the security of this Nation. 
   By increasing pay, by improving retirement, by enhancing retention, we are making, we hope, a significant contribution to the security of this Nation. The morale of our troops will be given a boost when they see a bigger pay raise than they expected. The morale of our troops will be boosted when they see a better retirement package than they previously had. The morale of our troops, and indeed of all of our citizens, should be boosted when they see that the readiness of our forces is given a boost from this bill. So the defense part of this bill, I believe, makes a significant contribution to the well-being of the men and women in the military and to the security of this Nation. 
   The problem we had on this bill came from the DOE reorganization because the conference report is significantly different from what passed the Senate. What passed the Senate, after a great deal of debate, was a reorganization of the Department of Energy which reflected the recommendation of the Rudman panel that there be a semiautonomous Department of Energy. I think most of us favored that. I surely do. But in a number of respects, this conference report goes beyond what the Senate passed by an overwhelming vote. And when we referred the language in the conference report to the Congressional Research Service and asked them to do an analysis for us, to tell us what the differences were and whether or not they really were relevant, whether or not they really were significant, whether or not they really limited the ability of the Secretary of Energy to run his Department, the CRS gave us their objective view of the conference report language. There are some parts of that CRS review which should make us all pause, and which made me pause. 
   The Congressional Research Service concluded, for instance, that the Secretary's authority over this new nuclear security administration, ``may be problematic, in view of the overall scheme of the proposed legislation.'' 
   The CRS said the language in the conference report raises questions about ``whether it is possible, or desirable in practice, to split policy and operations in organizational 
   terms.'' And the CRS report asks whether the practice of insulating the staff offices of this new entity from the departmental staff offices ``effectively vitiate[s] the meaning of the earlier provisions assigning the Secretary full authority and control over any function of the Administration and its personnel.'' 
   Those are significant questions and potentially significant problems. On the other hand, there is language in this conference report which says that this new entity is established ``within the Department of Energy,'' and therefore it is subject, obviously, to the direction and control of the Secretary. The conference report says that the Secretary of Energy--not the new head of this entity, an Under Secretary, but the Secretary himself--is responsible for ``developing the security, counterintelligence, and intelligence policies of the Department.'' 
   The conference report says that the Secretary of Energy--not the new head of the entity, who is an Under Secretary, but the Secretary--is given continuing responsibility for the security and counterintelligence problems within the Department's nuclear energy defense programs. And there are a number of other provisions similar to that. 
   So it seems to me one can at least fairly argue that, given that authority to establish policies, one will then have the authority to ensure that policies are carried out. So we are going to have to monitor very carefully this new entity as it is implemented, assuming the President, of course, does not veto it. If the President does veto it, there is no certainty by any stretch of the imagination that the veto would be sustained. I am voting for this bill. I am always open to the argument of a President, if he decided to veto it, as to why the veto, in fact, was dealt. 
   But based on what is before us, it seems to me there is at least a reasonable prospect that the Secretary of Energy will be able to manage this Department. We intend to create a semiautonomous entity--not a semiaccountable entity but a semiautonomous entity. We intend to create here a semiautonomous entity, not a semiaccountable Secretary of Energy. We want that Secretary to be fully accountable, which means he must be able to manage, control, and  direct his Department, the policies in that Department, and the implementation of those policies. 
   So I close by thanking our staff. I will not thank the pages since they apparently owe us one, since we kept them here late enough last night so they were relieved from some other duties. But I thank our staff for their great work in making this bill a reality. 
   I shall vote for this bill. I, again, thank the chairman for his reaching out to all members of the committee for contributions. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend my good friend from Virginia for his work on this bill and his leadership in the committee. It is a bipartisan style of leadership, and it is very productive. I commend him on it. It sets the kind of style which I hope will permeate this body in all the things we do, but it is absolutely essential in the national security area that we act in this way. He carries on a great tradition in doing so. 
   The conference report for the national defense for the fiscal year 2000 is a good bill, with one problem, and that problem is the provisions relating to the reorganization of the Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex. Because of the deficiencies in the DOE reorganization provisions, I declined to sign the conference report on this bill, but, at the time, I stated I would decide how to vote on the bill after a more careful analysis and a public airing of the provisions. 
   Back to the Department of Defense side of the bill because this is almost two bills but one conference report. We have a Department of Defense authorization bill, in its more traditional style, addressing the issues which we typically address, and we have this new kid on the block, this Department of Energy reorganization part of this bill, which is the problematic part. 
   The Department of Defense portion of the bill is a good agreement. It was reached through bipartisan and cooperative discussion among ourselves in the Senate and with our House colleagues. This conference report should go--and will go, in my judgment--a long way to meet the priorities established for our military by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   I very much agree with our good friend, Senator WARNER, as to what he said about this part of the bill and the priorities it sets, how it spends the additional funds. In accordance with the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution, the bill includes an $8.3 billion increase in budget authority above the level provided in the President's budget. Unlike the budget increases in past years, the added money in this bill will be spent in a manner in which the Department of Defense indicates it has the highest priorities. 
   That is a very important point. The chairman made the point in his remarks that, relative to the additional funds, we solicited from the Department what their highest priorities are and tried to reflect those priorities. 
   The bottom line is that this bill will go a long way to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform, it will improve the readiness of our military, and it will continue the process of modernizing our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the future. 
   Some of the add-ons, as I have indicated, the so-called increases, represent the highest-priority readiness items identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including an added $788 million for real property maintenance, something we frequently neglect and delay but which is essential--real property maintenance is not a glamorous item, but it is very important to quality of  life and to readiness--$380 million was added for base operations; $172 million for ammunition; $112 million for training center support; $151 million for depot maintenance. These are items that too frequently get shortchanged. In each case, these items will significantly enhance the ability of our Armed Forces to carry out their full range of missions. 
   As far as the members of the military are concerned, this is probably the most important Defense Authorization Act in recent years because of the improvements it will make in pay and benefits for the women and men in uniform. 
   The bill includes the triad of pay and retirement initiatives sought by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs: A 4.8-percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2000, reform of the military pay table to increase pay for midcareer NCOs and officers, and changes to the military retirement system. These changes should go a long way in addressing recruiting and retention problems in the services. My greatest disappointment in this area is that we were not able to enact the GI bill improvements that were proposed by Senator CLELAND this year. 
   I think every Member of this body wants to do everything they can to ensure the men and women in uniform receive fair compensation for the service they provide to their country. Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff made a persuasive case that the military is facing real recruiting and retention problems and that improvements in pay and benefits in the conference report are a critical element of any plan to address the recruiting and retention problems. 
   There are other important provisions in this bill as well. For example, the bill reported by the Armed Services Committee provides full funding for the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction Program with Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, although it would terminate work on the Russian chemical weapons destruction facility. Unfortunately, two of the three companion programs at the Department of Energy, the initiative for proliferation prevention and the nuclear cities initiatives, received less funding than requested by the administration. 
   The bill also contains some unfortunate restrictions on those two programs at the Department of Energy which are going to limit the effectiveness of these programs. Nonetheless, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and those related Department of Energy programs are a cornerstone of our relationship with Russia, and although the DOE programs were not funded at the level requested, nonetheless they are funded at a significant level and these programs play an important role in our national security by reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from Russia and rogue nations with which Russia may form closer ties in the absence of those programs. 
   There were other disappointments as well. In addition to the reduction of the requests for the DOE programs that I mentioned, Senator WELL-STONE's amendment to provide some relief for a group of veterans who contracted serious illnesses after being exposed to radiation while participating in nuclear tests or while serving at Hiroshima or Nagasaki after the war, adopted in the Senate, was not accepted in conference because when we got to conference, the House conferees said the amendment would increase the so-called mandatory or entitlement spending, and they had no jurisdiction on that issue. As a result, they would not agree to include this provision in the conference report. That is a disappointment. It is a disappointment to me, and I think it will be a disappointment to those veterans who were so exposed. 
   But the conference report, again, has so many important provisions that we should look at the whole DOD report and weigh that as a whole. When we do that, it seems to me the Department of Defense portion of this bill makes a very large contribution to national security and the effective management of the Department of Defense--including other provisions such as the provision establishing new procedures to protect the military's access to essential frequency spectrum; such as the provision requiring the Department to establish specific budget reporting procedures for all funds to combat terrorism, both at home and abroad; such as a series of provisions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care provided to service men and women under the TRICARE program; such as provisions promoting reform of the Department of Defense financial management systems; such as the provisions promoting more effective management of the defense laboratories and test and evaluation facilities; such as provisions extending the Department's small disadvantaged business goals and its mentor-protegee program for small disadvantaged businesses for 3 years. 
   As I indicated, this conference report is really two bills. It is a DOD authorization bill, but it is also a reorganization of the entire Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex. It does the latter in a way which is inconsistent with the bill that was passed by the Senate by a vote of 96-1 earlier this year, inconsistent in a number of important ways. 
   It goes beyond anything that has even been considered by the House of Representatives. While there is a broad consensus that we need to address the management and accountability programs at DOE, particularly in the areas of security and counterintelligence, the provisions in this bill could undermine Secretary Richardson's efforts to secure our nuclear secrets and make the Department even more difficult to manage than it is today. 
   That is the question we struggle with and that I and a number of the members of our committee have struggled with, and I know Members of this body are struggling with that as well--the final provisions that were put in the conference report to try to analyze: What is the difference, if any, between these provisions in the conference report and the Senate provisions which we adopted to implement the semiautonomous agency recommendation of Senator Rudman? 
   So I wrote a letter to the Congressional Research Service requesting an independent assessment of the impact of the conference report on the ability of the Secretary of Energy to 
   manage the Department's nuclear weapons programs. The CRS memorandum prepared in response to my letter this month raises serious questions about the impact of the Department of Energy reorganization provisions in this conference report. 
   The CRS concluded that the Secretary's authority over the new National Nuclear Security Administration ``may be problematic in view of the overall scheme of the proposed legislation.'' For instance, the CRS memorandum raises the question about ``whether it is possible, or desirable in practice, to split policy and operations in organizational terms''; and asks whether the practice of insulating administration staff offices from departmental staff offices ``effectively vitiate[s] the meaning of the earlier provisions assigning the Secretary full authority and control over any function of the Administration and its personnel.'' 
   The CRS memorandum also points out the legislation would permit the administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Agency to ``establish Administration-specific policies, unless disapproved by the Secretary of Energy.'' And the CRS points out that ``This procedure reverses the general practice in the departments and to the extent that the Secretary is not the issuing authority, a major tool of management and accountability is shifted to a subordinate office.'' 
   If this legislation were interpreted, as the CRS indicates it could be interpreted, to undermine the authority of the Secretary, it would have the perverse effect of diffusing responsibility in the Department, leaving reporting channels even more ``convoluted, confusing, and contradictory'' than those observed by the Rudman Commission. 
   I supported the Rudman recommendation and still do. The Rudman recommendation recommends a semiautonomous entity inside the Department of Energy. But what the CRS report does is raise questions about whether or not this language--which is different from the Senate language which was overwhelmingly adopted--in this conference report goes beyond semiautonomous.  
   None of the models of a semiautonomous agency cited by the Rudman Commission in its report--the National Reconnaissance Office; the National Security Agency; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA; or the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA--limit the authority of the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the agency as much as these provisions seem to do. 
   However, the ambiguities in this bill may leave open another choice. We are dealing with ambiguities in language. So we have to look at: Are there other interpretations, other choices which may be available in light of these ambiguities? 
   In particular, there is language which can be construed to give authority to the Secretary which might allow him to run this agency, called the Department of Energy, in a way which will provide accountability in the Secretary because he is the one to whom we must look to be accountable. We want him to be able to run the agency. 
   That is why it is called a semiautonomous entity in the Rudman report. They do not recommend an autonomous entity. They recommend a semiautonomous entity. They cite models, the ones I have just indicated, which allow the Secretary of the agency in question to run his agency, including all parts of it, including the semiautonomous parts. 
   There is language in this conference report which remains which does point towards the ability of the Secretary to run his 
   entire agency, to be accountable and responsible for it. 
   I want to just read some of that language. 
   For instance, the new administration--this new entity--is established ``within the Department of Energy'', and is therefore subject to the direction and control of the Secretary. 
   The Secretary of Energy, in this conference report--not the head of the new entity, the under secretary, but the Secretary of Energy--is responsible for ``developing the security, counterintelligence, and intelligence policies of the Department'' under section 214. 
   For instance, the Department's counterintelligence chief, not his subordinate in the new administration, is ``responsible for establishing policy for counterintelligence programs and activities at Department facilities in order to reduce the threat of disclosure or loss of classified and other sensitive information at such facilities'' under section 215. 
   Another example of language pointing toward accountability in the Secretary--where we want it, ultimately, in this Department or any Department--is that the Secretary of Energy, not the new under secretary but the Secretary of Energy himself, is given continuing responsibility for the security and counterintelligence problems within the Department's nuclear energy defense programs by sections 3150, 3152, 3154, and 3164 of the bill. 
   Other language which may give some comfort to those of us who are concerned about the diffusion of accountability in this new language--not adopted by the Senate, not adopted by the House, but put into the conference report--other language which may hopefully give some comfort is that the Secretary of Energy, not the new under secretary, is given the responsibility for appointing the Chief of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence and the Chief of Defense Nuclear Security within the new administration. 
   I think one can fairly argue that the authority to establish Department-wide policies carries with it the authority to ensure that such policies are carried out. On that basis and on the basis of these other provisions I have just quoted, this legislation could be interpreted to give the Secretary of Energy continuing authority to manage the Department, including the authority to direct and control the new National Nuclear Security Administration. 
   So while it is unfortunate that this bill has confused reporting relationships and blurred lines of authority, I believe a strong Secretary of Energy may be able to overcome these difficulties and address the Department's problems in an effective manner. He should not have to be confronted with these difficulties, but he may be able to overcome them. We will need to continually reexamine these provisions and modify them as appropriate to ensure that the Secretary and the Department have the tools they need to ensure the security of our nuclear deterrent. 
   The National Association of Attorneys General has raised an important concern about this legislation. In two letters dated September 3, 1999, to the President and the congressional leadership, the National Association of Attorneys General states that the DOE reorganization provisions in this bill ``would weaken the existing internal and external oversight structure for DOE's environment, safety, and health operations.'' 
   Here again, the Secretary of Energy may be able to overcome the ambiguities in the bill and exercise strong independent oversight over the new administration, ensuring that applicable laws, regulations, and agreements protecting health, safety, and the environment continue to be enforced. This legislation then may be ratified by the courts consistent with its intent--which we put in the Senate version of this bill--to make no change to existing substantive and procedural mechanisms for enforcing such laws, regulations, and agreements. 
   I wish these flawed DOE reorganization provisions had not been added in conference. As a matter of fact, adding extraneous material in this way is a dubious legislative practice that too often results in unsound legislation. The concerns raised by attorneys general should serve as a reminder to all of us of the hazards of trying to legislate on complex issues in a conference committee convened to deliberate on unrelated matters. 
   I am going to vote for this bill because I believe it is possible that the DOE reorganization provisions can be interpreted in a manner that will permit the sound management of the Department of Energy and because the provisions are a part of what is otherwise a good bill. If the DOE reorganization mandated by this bill proves to create problems, we will then have to consider solutions to those problems in the future. We are going to need to monitor this bill closely as it is implemented. 
   We don't know if the President will or will not veto this bill. Perhaps the President indicated to my good friend from Virginia last night at the meeting. But we do not have any indication as to whether or not the President will veto this bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia. We are, indeed, not only old colleagues but dear friends. 
   Mr. President, as I indicated, I will be voting for this bill tomorrow. I believe it is again possible that the reorganization provisions of the Department of Energy can be interpreted in a manner that will permit the Department to be managed soundly. It is my hope that that will be the case. 
   If in fact the President decides to veto this matter--we do not know what he will do--then obviously I, for one, will be willing to consider any arguments and reasoning that might be proposed. But I have no reason to know that that is forthcoming. We just have no indication that in fact a veto is or is not forthcoming. We simply have to do what we, in our best judgment, believe is best. Of course, we are always willing to consider any thoughts or reasoning of the President if and when a veto message is received. 
   Finally, I want to again thank our good chairman. He has put together a bill with provisions in it that are going to make a real difference for the men and women in our military. As the ranking member of this committee, I have worked very closely with him. Republicans and Democrats on this committee don't always agree, but we surely agreed on the end point, which is that the well-being of the men and women in our military and the security of this country has to be first and foremost. It is not a partisan issue. The constructive leadership which our chairman has always provided on so many issues has been part of a great tradition of the Armed Services Committee. 
   As he rightfully points out, our staffs are essential to that contribution. We all strive to make a bipartisan contribution to the security of this Nation. We succeed at times. I am sure we don't succeed at other times, as hard as we try. But we would not succeed to the extent we do but for the staffs who also work on a bipartisan basis. Dave Lyles, Les 
   Brownlee, and all of our staff under their leadership are essential to the successes that we have. 
   I, like the chairman, want to thank our subcommittee chairman and all the members of our committee for their work during the past year, starting with the subcommittee hearings this spring and the good work in this bill that is aimed at improving the quality of life for men and women in the military. Their readiness and their support will indeed have that impact and will have that positive effect we so fervently wish for. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. There are concerns within the Michigan delegation, Mr. President, that the proposal to close Muskegon may have been due to the Coast Guard's constrained funding and was not necessarily based on an analysis of the safety needs of boaters on Southern Lake Michigan. 
   Mr. President, it would appear premature to close the facility at Muskegon given the investment made by both the Coast Guard and the local community to establish this seasonal facility. In choosing to locate the facility in Muskegon in the first place, the Coast Guard projected large cost savings that would not be fully realized if the station were closed.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, students in Detroit are now back in school, just like their peers across the river in Windsor, Ontario. Each classroom of students is going through virtually the same routine. They are writing about their summer vacations, obtaining textbooks, signing up for sports teams, and trying to memorize locker combinations. They are figuring out bus routes, testing new backpacks and worrying about that third period teacher who assigns too much homework. There is just one major difference between the students in Detroit and those in Windsor. Students in Detroit have to worry about guns in school. 
   In the United States, another classroom of children is killed by firearms every two days. That doesn't mean that every few days, there is another Columbine mass murder. But statistics show that each day 13 children die from gunfire, and every two days, the equivalent of a classroom of American children is struck by the tragedy of gun violence. In Windsor, the Canadian town  that borders Detroit, there were only 4 firearm homicides in 1997. In Detroit, for that same year, there were 354 firearm homicides. If the population of Detroit and Windsor were equal, the number of firearm deaths would be nearly eighteen times higher in Detroit, a city less than 1,000 yards away. 
   I'd like to include in the RECORD, an op-ed printed in the USA Today, showing the differences between Canadian and American death rates involving firearms, and specifically the differences between Windsor and Detroit. If there's one thing Congress needs to study this school year, it's how to rewrite the books and end the senseless slaughter of our school children.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment before us is very simply to increase CAFE, despite all the flaws with the CAFE system. This is not just a study as is being suggested. The purpose of this amendment is very clear from the wording of every single whereas clause and every resolve clause: it is to increase CAFE, despite the many flaws in the current CAFE system. 
   If anybody has any doubt about what the purpose of this amendment is, I urge them to read it, and particularly the last 
   paragraph which urges the Senate not to recede to section 320 of the bill as passed by the House of Representatives, which prevents an increase in CAFE standards. 
   Now, some have said all this amendment does is provide for a study. Well, this is a study whose results have been prejudged and preordained, by the authors of this amendment, because there is not one word in this amendment about safety concerns, as the Senator from Missouri and my colleague from Michigan have talked about, or about the increase in the number of deaths which have resulted from CAFE. Those are not our allegations but safety experts' allegations. There is not one word in this amendment about the loss of American jobs and the discriminatory impact of CAFE against domestic production. I will get into that in a moment. 
   This isn't just a study we are talking about. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution specifically says that the Senate should not recede to a section in the House bill which prevents an increase  in CAFE standards. It doesn't say anything about not receding to a section which prevents a study. It doesn't talk about a study which looks at highway safety, impact on domestic employment, favoritism toward imports, discriminatory impacts on domestic manufacturers and workers. It doesn't talk about that at all. There is not a word about any of these issues in this amendment--only about increasing the CAFE standards. 
   There are many flaws in the CAFE approach. My colleagues have already gone into some of those flaws at length. But first I want to again quote, very briefly, from the National Academy of Sciences' automotive fuel economy study, so that people don't think opposition to this amendment comes only from folks who have a lot of automobile production in their State--although we do and we are proud of it, and we are determined that it be treated fairly and sensibly. We surely stand for that, and we do so proudly. But this is the National Academy of Sciences speaking here. The National Academy of Sciences said the following in this automotive fuel economy study:  
   The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration of the approach.  
   ``Defects that are sufficiently grievous.'' There is not a word about studying those defects in this amendment. I have looked really hard through this amendment. I read it a couple of times this afternoon. I can't find anything about studying those defects that are ``sufficiently grievous,'' according to the National Academy of Sciences--that they should be part of the study. The purpose of this resolution is to increase CAFE, to bring about the result that CAFE is increased. 
   Now, why not do that? Why not increase CAFE? Sure, let's just increase the number from 20 to 25, or 30 to 35, or 35 to 40. Why not? We will save fuel. The answer is, because there are a number of other considerations that have to be looked at, which weren't looked at when this CAFE system was put into place. CAFE has had a discriminatory impact on the domestic industry and has had a horrendous effect on safety and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. 
   Now, the safety issue has been discussed this afternoon, but I want to just highlight one or two parts of it, although the Senator from Missouri has just spoken to it. There was a USA Today study. This isn't an auto industry study. This isn't an auto supplier study. This isn't the UAW study. This is a study by USA Today looking at statistics on automobile highway deaths. 
   Here is what the USA Today study found. They found that in the 24 years since a landmark law to conserve fuel was passed, big cars have shrunk to less-safe sizes, and small cars have poured on the road, and, as a result, 46,000 people have died in crashes. They would have survived in bigger, heavier cars, according to the USA Today analysis of crash data since 1975 when the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed. The law and the corporate average fuel economy standards it imposed have improved fuel efficiency. The average passenger vehicle on U.S. roads gets 20 miles per gallon versus 14 miles per gallon in 1975. But the cost has been, roughly, 7,700 deaths for every mile per gallon gained, this analysis shows. 
   Is it worth looking at fuel economy? Of course it is. Is it worth looking at 46,000 deaths? Is it worth putting that on the scale and at least looking at it? It sure ought to be. There is not a word about that in this resolution, nothing about safety. We are told this amendment is only about a study. Well, if so, it is the most one-sided study I have ever seen. 
   Now, it has been argued: Wait a minute, aren't these deaths the result of small cars running into big vehicles? Again, the study answers that. Tellingly, it says most small-crash deaths involve only small cars--56 percent in 1997, from the latest Government data. They run into something else, such as a tree, or into one another. In contrast, just 1 percent--according to this article--of small-car deaths occurred in crashes with midsize or big sport utility vehicles in 1997, according to statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
   according to the agency that enforces the safety rules. 
   That is one of the major problems with CAFE--the safety problem, the loss of life. 
   There are other problems as well. I would like to spend a few of the minutes allotted to me to talk about the discrimination of this system against domestic production. One of the many problems with CAFE is that it looks at the entire fleet. It looks at the average of the manufacturers' fleet. That fleet could be predominantly small in size. It could be predominantly medium in size. It could be predominantly large in size. It doesn't make any difference what your mix is; you must meet the same corporate fleet average. 
   If you have produced, for instance, historically many small vehicles, then because of the way the CAFE rules are jiggered, there are no effective limits on how many large vehicles you can sell. But if historically you have produced larger vehicles, then it has a tremendous impact on your production and a penalty for the production of more. 
   The result of this is that if, as in the case with the imports, you have focused on lighter vehicles rather than the heavier vehicles, which are very much now in demand, CAFE has no effect whatsoever on your production or on your sales. But if you are a domestic manufacturer that has focused on the larger vehicles, it has a huge effect on you and on the number of jobs you might have. 
   There is no logic or fairness to that kind of approach. CAFE didn't say you have to increase by 10 percent the efficiency of your light vehicles, or your medium-size vehicles, or your heavier vehicles. It says: Take your whole fleet together and reach a certain standard. 
   Some people say: Well, aren't the imports more fuel efficient? The answer is no. Pound for pound, there is no difference between an imported vehicle and a domestic vehicle. A domestic vehicle is probably a little bit more fuel efficient. 
   Take two vehicles of the same size. Take a GM and Toyota pickup truck--the GM Sierra, and the Toyota Tundra. They both weigh about the same. These are their highway ratings: 18 miles per gallon for the GM vehicle, and 17 miles per gallon for the Toyota vehicle. The GM vehicle is more fuel efficient than the Toyota. These are the same size vehicles. Now we are comparing apples and apples--not fleet averages which are apples and oranges, but apples and apples. The city rating is the same thing. The GM Sierra has a 15-miles-per-gallon rating. The Toyota Tundra has a 14-miles-per-gallon rating. 
   So the discriminatory impact does not have anything to do with the efficiency of vehicles of the same size since, if anything, the domestic vehicle is at least as efficient as the import when you compare the same size vehicles. 
   Then where is the discriminatory impact? The discriminatory impact arises because the import manufacturers have tended to focus on the smaller vehicles instead of the larger vehicles. They have room to sell as many large vehicles as they want without any impact. CAFE does not affect them. Any manufacturer that has focused on the smaller vehicles instead of the larger suffers no impact when CAFE goes up. 
   Let's go back to that Tundra and that Sierra. How many more vehicles could General Motors sell? These are the same size vehicles. With the GM vehicle being slightly more fuel efficient than the Toyota vehicle, how many more can GM sell under CAFE? None. How many more can Toyota sell? Over 300,000 more. 
   Does that do anything for the air? It is costing American jobs. It doesn't do a thing for the air. All it does is tell people if they want to buy a vehicle, a large vehicle, they have to buy the imported vehicle, and not the domestic one. The domestic manufacturer is penalized if it is produced under the CAFE approach. 
   CAFE was designed in a way--I don't think intentionally, and I pray to God it wasn't--but it was designed in a way which has a discriminatory impact on the domestic producer because of the way in which their fleets happened to be designed historically--because of the type of cars they sold historically--and not because the imported vehicle is more fuel efficient. It isn't.  
   These numbers are typical. If you have two vehicles of equal size, one import and one domestic, they are about the same in terms of fuel efficiency. 
   So when you increase CAFE, all you are saying is buy an import. That is what this thing drives people to do. The import manufacturer isn't penalized. There is no limit effectively on how many larger vehicles the import manufacturers can sell. It bites on the domestic manufacturers--not on the imports. That is a huge effect on jobs in America, with no advantage to the air. 
   Do we think it does good to the air to tell people to buy yourself a Tundra instead of a Sierra? Does that do anything for the air? Quite the opposite. It hurts the air. The Tundra is not as fuel efficient as the Sierra. Yet there is no penalty whatsoever under CAFE for the import manufacturer selling basically an unlimited number of heavy vehicles. 
   We have a system in place now which has had a very negative effect on safety and an increase in the number of highway deaths. These are not our figures but figures of people who are on the outside looking at the statistics of the highway safety folks. It has had a negative effect in terms of domestic versus imports, which is discriminatory. 
   Again, I want to emphasize this. It is a very important point. Some people think the imports are more fuel efficient. They are not. 
   It is the key point. They are not more fuel efficient--slightly less; if I had to characterize--there is no difference, basic difference, pound for pound. 
   What does this amendment do? It expands the current system. We have CAFE; let's increase the CAFE standards. Let's not even look at impact on safety, increased highway deaths, or discriminatory impact on domestic production. That is not referred to in this amendment. Just fuel. That is it. 
   But CAFE's discriminatory impact takes such a narrow vision, a narrow view on jobs in America. I hope this amendment is defeated. It is pointing in a very narrow direction, in a direction which ignores the discriminatory impact on jobs in America. It ignores safety issues and focuses on one piece of an issue, ignoring totally the other parts. 
   Finally, the Government and the private sector or private industry have put together a partnership for new vehicles. This partnership is focusing on new technologies and new materials, trying to see if we cannot find ways to have larger vehicles with higher fuel economy. This partnership is looking at lightweight materials, advanced batteries, fuel cells, hybrid electric propulsion systems; experimental concepts sometimes, but things which will--in a cooperative way--achieve the kind of goal which CAFE theoretically was aimed at achieving. 
   This partnership approach for a new generation of vehicles is working. It is in operation now. It is the right way to go. The Government contribution to this partnership has been about $220 million a year. The private sector's annual contribution to this partnership has been slightly under $1 billion a year. We have this investment in a partnership, in a new generation of vehicles which is aimed at achieving significant improvements in fuel efficiency without the downsides, which have been described here--the negative safety impacts and the negative effects on domestic production. That partnership is now in its fourth year. We should allow that partnership to proceed. It is on a cooperative track, aimed at achieving goals without such negative side effects. 
   I hope the Senate will reject this resolution and will keep on the partnership track which is being so productively followed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me quickly comment on the question of highway deaths. The study of USA Today is that 46,000 people have died in crashes that would have survived in larger cars. I have not heard that fact disputed. We have seen a chart which shows that there are fewer highway deaths and that we have better fuel economy, but that chart doesn't show the two are causally connected. 
   Indeed, the fewer highway deaths may come from seatbelts, a greater effort on the anti-alcoholism campaign, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, a number of other causes. But the outside figure, not the auto industry, not the unions, not the supplier, not the insurance industry, which opposes this amendment, the outside survey done by USA Today says 46,000 people lost their lives who would not have lost their lives but for this CAFE approach. 
   When we look at the resolution, we don't see any reference to safety. We don't see any reference to the discriminatory impact on domestics that have a different mix in their fleets. We only see a reference to fuel. That is the one factor at which this resolution looks. 
   Then at the end it makes it very clear what it is driving at--talking about driving. This resolution is aimed at one thing: to increase CAFE standards. This isn't just ``let's have a study, look at the impact on safety, look at the discriminatory impact on domestic production.'' This isn't just let's have a study. This is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should not recede to a House provision which prevents an increase in CAFE standards, not which prevents a study. This resolution, by every single provision in its whereas clauses, is driving us towards an increase in CAFE standards, without consideration of safety impacts or the discriminatory impact on domestic production. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion for working people from my home State of Michigan, Frank Garrison, who is retiring this month from his position as president of the Michigan AFL-CIO after more than 40 years in the labor movement. 
   In many ways, Frank's life story is the story of the labor movement itself over these past 65 years. Born Franklin Delano Garrison in 1934, during the depths of the Great Depression, he was named for the President who gave hope to millions of working Americans and whose Works Projects Administration provided Frank's father with a job. At the age of 10, Frank entered the workforce himself, shoveling coal into his school's boilers so his brothers and sisters could eat lunch at school. 
   While these early years taught Frank the value of work, they also taught him that to achieve their piece of the American dream, working people needed strong advocates, both in the workplace and in government. He joined the United Auto Workers in 1952 working at the Saginaw Steering Gear plant in Saginaw, Michigan. Once in the union, the same work ethic that filled that school boiler with coal helped Frank rise through the ranks. He held several positions in his local and his region on his way to becoming the UAW's Legislative Director in 1976 and the Executive Director of the Union's Community Action Program in 1982. During those years, he played a key role in many election campaigns and even helped an upstart former President of the Detroit City Council win a seat in the United States Senate. 
   In 1986, after the sudden death of Michigan AFL-CIO President Sam Fishman, Frank was selected president by the AFL-CIO's General Board. Throughout the thirteen years he has served in that position he has upheld the finest traditions of the labor movement. In an era when special interests tried to dominate the political debate, Frank's was a voice that spoke for the broad interest of working people, whether or not they ever carried a union card--fighting for a higher minimum wage, for health care for all, to strengthen Social Security and Medicaid and to preserve those industrial jobs that had brought economic security to working families in Michigan and throughout the country. Few Americans have fought longer or harder for working people than Frank Garrison. His pursuit of justice in the workplace has improved opportunity and security and safety for an untold number of Americans. 
   And through it all, the good times and the bad, the victories and the defeats, Frank never lost touch with the convictions that brought him to the labor movement in the first place. And he never lost that twinkle in his eye or the ability to fill a room with laughter, sometimes at my expense, but more often at his own. He has been a strong leader, a wise counselor, but most of all a loyal friend. 
   Mr. President, Frank Garrison has earned the respect and gratitude of so many people from my home state of Michigan both within and without the labor movement, and across the political spectrum. I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him and his family well in his well deserved retirement, and in offering him a heartfelt ``thank you'' for his lifelong commitment to improving the lives of working men and women and their families.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Representative BLAGOJEVICH and Representative WAXMAN, asked the Office of Special Investigations within the General Accounting Office (GAO) to investigate the manufacture and distribution of fifty caliber armor piercing ammunition, some of the most  powerful and destructive ammunition available. This investigation made public a little known program administered by the Department of Defense that makes unserviceable, excess and obsolete military ammunition available for civilian use. 
   Under the Conventional Demilitarization Program, military armor piercing ammunition is transferred through a U.S. Company to the civilian market. This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate metal, ballistic or bullet-proof glass, even armored cars or helicopters. With use of the fifty caliber sniper rifle, this ammunition can start fires and explosions and strike targets from extraordinary lengths. This is ammunition that is in no way suitable for civilian use. According to James Schmidt II, the President of Arizona Ammunition Inc. and a member of the Board of Directors for the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association, ``the armor piercing, incendiary, and tracer type bullets are used by the police and military. Those available to the consumer are generally surplus. Our company does not sell these to the general public because they have no sporting application.'' 
   Yet, through the Conventional Demilitarization Program, the Department of Defense makes their surplus available to the general public. The Department pays Talon Manufacturing Company $1 per ton to take possession of its demilitarized armor piercing ammunition. A percentage of this ammunition is then reconstructed and resold by Talon to domestic and foreign militaries, and to civilian buyers. In one business year, Talon sold 181,000 rounds of this refurbished military ammunition to civilian customers. 
   Once available on the market, this extremely powerful ammunition is subject to virtually no restriction. It is easier to purchase armor piercing ammunition capable of penetrating steel and exploding on impact, than it is to buy a handgun. This deadly and incredibly damaging ammunition can be sold to anyone over 18 and possessed by anyone of any age. No federal background check is necessary. Purchases may be made easily by mail order, fax, or over the counter, and there are no federal requirements that dealers retain sales records. These loose restrictions make armor piercing ammunition highly popular among terrorists, drug traffickers and violent criminals. 
   Certainly, the U.S. Military is not responsible for all of the armor piercing ammunition on the civilian market, but they are responsible for hundreds of thousands of armor piercing, incendiary and tracer rounds made available to the general public each year. I am an original cosponsor of legislation that would prohibit the Department of Defense from entering into contracts that permit demilitarized armor piercing ammunition to be sold to the general public. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and put an end to this program.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Stanley J. Winkelman who recently passed away. Stanley will of course be remembered for the department stores which bore his family name, but it was his efforts in the community which were most dear to him and for which he will be enshrined in the memory of our community. 
   Stanley Winkelman was born in 1922 in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where his father operated a women's clothing store. In 1928, Stanley's father moved the family to Detroit so that he could join his brother in forming Winkelman Brothers Apparel, Inc. As Stanley grew and matured, so did the family enterprise. 
   In 1943, Stanley Winkelman graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. That same year, Stanley married his sweetheart, Margaret ``Peggy'' Wallace. The couple would go on to have three wonderful children, Marjorie, Andra, and Roger. Following graduation, Stanley worked as a research chemist at the California Institute of Technology and served as a naval officer during World War II. After the war, Stanley returned to Detroit to take part in the family business, eventually rising to hold the positions of president, chairman of the board and CEO, and in the process, becoming the guiding force of the company. At the peak of the company's success it owned a chain of 95 stores specializing in fashionable yet affordable clothing for women. The Winkelman's chain was sold in 1983 and Stanley retired in 1984. However, Stanley's retirement did not slow his commitment and service to the community. 
   Throughout his life, Stanley was intimately involved in issues surrounding the city of Detroit. He took part in a 1963 Detroit Commission on Community Relations where he called upon the Detroit Board of Education to speed up desegregation by hiring more black teachers. Following the 1967 Detroit riots, Stanley was the leader of a New Detroit subcommittee on community services which called for a much needed review of the Detroit Police Department. In the wake of the riots, Stanley displayed his steadfast commitment to the city of Detroit by keeping his stores in the city. Stanley Winkelman's sense of social responsibility has helped lay the foundation for the resurgence of downtown Detroit. 
   Throughout his life, Stanley was a strong supporter of education. He supported his alma mater, the University of Michigan, with both his time and money. He devoted much of his time to Detroit's education system, with particular attention given to the education of the poorest among us. Stanley also held positions of leadership in  Detroit's Metropolitan Fund, the Jewish Welfare League, United Foundation, and Temple Beth El. 
   Stanley Winkelman offered American shoppers value, but his real lasting legacy is the values he reflected and fought for to make his community a better place to live. I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Stanley Winkelman on the many great accomplishments of his life as we mourn his passing.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and my good friend from New York. 
   This bill before us is unfair and it is unwise. It is unwise because the projected surplus that the bill uses for the tax cut is based on our abiding by spending limits that have already been breached and which would require huge cuts that we cannot make and should not make in veterans' programs, education programs, criminal law enforcement, and other important programs for the people of this Nation.  
   If the surplus to this extent materializes, in fact we should then reduce the national debt that has been built up, particularly over the last 20 years. That would be the greatest gift of all that we could make for the American people, the reduction of that debt, because that would be a reduction in the interest rates which people pay on their mortgages and cars and credit cards, and that would truly be a contribution to the well-being of our constituents. 
   The American people also sense that the tax program before us is unfair and not just unwise; they know--this has not apparently been contested--that 40 percent goes to the upper 1 percent of our people. The highest income 1 percent get over 40 percent of the tax benefits in this bill. More than 80 percent of the tax benefits in this bill go to the upper 20 percent of our people. 
   It is, in fact, true that we are dealing with the people's money. It has frequently been said here that what we are talking about is whether or not to give back to at least some of the people their own money. It is true. This money--this surplus--belongs to the American people. But the economy belongs to the American people as well. The Social Security system belongs to the American people as well. The Medicare system belongs to the American people as well. The Head Start program belongs to the American people. Veteran hospitals belong to the American people. 
   It is important that we consider what to do with a projected surplus--that we deal with this surplus as what it is, the people's money, but look at all of what we do here as hopefully carrying out the people's business. 
   This bill takes us down the wrong road--the road back toward the deficit ditch that we are finally beginning to climb out of. It has taken us fewer years than expected. But, nonetheless, it has taken us about 6 years to get out of the ditch which we got ourselves into, particularly during the decade of the 1980s. 
   Now that we are finally out of that ditch, we should stay out of that ditch. We should use any real surplus--not projected surplus but any real surplus--to protect Social Security and Medicare, and have a prescription program, and to do what is vitally necessary to invest in our people, particularly through their education, but then to pay down that national debt and to give back to the people what they truly want, which is a sound economy on a long-term basis and low interest rates on a long-term basis. That is what would be guaranteed if, in fact, we apply any real surplus beyond Social Security and Medicare prescription needs, beyond the investment in education, if we take that surplus, if it is real, and pay down the national debt. 
   Instead, this bill takes us down a different road, a road which will deliver a huge tax cut mainly for those among us who need it the least and who are, for the most part, not even 
   asking us for it. This bill represents an imprudent and unfair step, and we should not take it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the news out of Kosovo concerning the commission of atrocities against Serbs and Gypsies is deeply troubling. 
   According to a report released on Tuesday by Human Rights Watch ``for the province's minorities, and especially the Serb and Roma (Gypsy) populations, as well as some ethnic populations perceived as collaborators or as political opponents of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), these changes have brought fear, uncertainty, and in some cases violence.'' The report adds that ``The intent behind many of the killings and abductions that have occurred in the province since early June appears to be the expulsion of Kosovo's Serb and Roma population rather than a desire for revenge alone.'' 
   Mr. President, the massive atrocities committed against the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo pursuant to Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing policy have been appropriately condemned by the international community. The United States and our NATO allies have invested a great deal of resources and put their sons and daughters at risk to stop the atrocities and to reverse the ethnic cleansing. But they did not do so to allow the former victims to commit atrocities against or seek to ethnically cleanse the Serbs and Gypsies. 
   When I visited Kosovo in the first week of July along with Senators REED, LANDRIEU and SESSIONS, we met with Hashim Thaci, political leader of the KLA and Colonel Agim Ceku, the KLA military commander. We condemned the violence being perpetrated against the Serbs and asked them to speak out against the mistreatment of the Serbs. They stated to us they have publicly called for the Serbs to stay and for those who have left to return provided they had not previously committed atrocities. 
   Mr. President, words are important but deeds are more important. I realize that the KLA is not a highly-disciplined organization and that there are extremists within the KLA who do not answer to either Mr. Thaci or Colonel Ceku. I also realize that not all those who are presently committing atrocities are members of the KLA. But Mr. Thaci and Colonel Ceku and other Albanian leaders must do more to bring an end to the cycle of violence in Kosovo. 
   According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 164,000 Serbs have left Kosovo during the seven weeks since Yugoslav and Serb forces withdrew and KFOR entered Kosovo, and the number continues to rise. The military troops of the NATO-led KFOR are not trained to be policemen and the enforcement of day-to-day law and order is not and should not be their mission. The United Nations has only deployed about 400 civilian police to Kosovo. The deployment of the international civilian police force to Kosovo must be accelerated. The cycle of violence in Kosovo must stop. 
   I visited with the ethnic Albanian refugees in the camps in Macedonia and was sickened at their horrific stories of their mistreatment at the hands of the Serbs. I was a strong supporter of the NATO air campaign against Serbia and of the deployment of the NATO-led KFOR. I support the reconstruction of Kosovo and the creation of an autonomous multi-ethnic Kosovo. But none of us, no matter what position we took on other issues involved in NATO's action in Kosovo, can accept criminal acts against Serbs and Gypsies in Kosovo. 
   President Clinton and the leaders of our NATO allies won the support of their citizens for the NATO air campaign and subsequent peacekeeping mission in part because it was the humane thing to do. Americans and Europeans alike were deeply upset at the plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees. That support will dissipate if the cycle of violence in Kosovo does not stop. 
   I call on NATO, the United Nations, the leaders of the ethnic Albanian community in Kosovo, particularly Mr. Thaci and Colonel Ceku, and the law abiding citizens of Kosovo, to act and act now to show their rejection of lawlessness and violence. The cycle of violence must stop.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in less than two weeks, the students of Columbine High School will resume classes and begin their 1999-2000 school year. Since the now infamous Columbine massacre on April 20th, the school has gone through a complete transformation. Sixteen high-definition security cameras have been installed in the school; bullet holes have been patched or covered; the alarm system, which rang for hours during the reign of terror, has been replaced; and new glass windows have been installed to replace broken ones shattered by bullets and home-made bombs. In addition, keyed entry doors have been replaced by high-security electronic doors, a makeshift library has been created out of classrooms, and the school district has hired two additional security guards for protection. 
   School officials will be making additional changes up until the very day students come back on August 16th, all in an effort to make the Columbine students feel safer when they return to school. Yet, Columbine students were not the only ones affected by last April's shooting. Students and teachers around the nation have lost the sense of safety they deserve to have at school. These students will hardly regain that safety by new landscaping or replaced alarm systems. These students and their families will continue to live in fear until the real issue at hand is addressed: the easy accessibility that young people have to guns. 
   When school resumes on August 16th at Columbine and around the nation, Congress will have done nothing to prevent young people from purchasing dangerous weapons. Students across the nation will walk into school to begin a new year, while Congress is in a month-long recess, having done nothing to change the same loopholes in the  same Federal firearms laws that put the weapons in the hands of minors. 
   Congress's failure to act is inexcusable. Moderate reforms designed to limit juvenile access to firearms are long overdue. Yet, proponents of even the most modest gun safety legislation have come up against nothing but stonewalling and procedural delays. Sadly, it seems as if action on the juvenile justice bill is only propelled forward by additional tragedies; the Senate bill, having been passed on the day of another school shooting at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia, and the final motion to appoint conferees occurring just one day after a mass shooting in Atlanta. I pray that it does not take yet another mass shooting to move this legislation out of Conference Committee and onto the President's desk.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers have accepted the amendment that I introduced adding funds for existing research programs under the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) to help identify and develop alternatives for pesticides that are currently necessary for fruit production and whose use is likely to be restricted under the Food Quality Protection Act. This research program has provided much needed support to Michigan's fruit producers, and I thank the managers for allowing it to continue. It is my understanding that the full amount of the cost of this program will come from the ``Markets, trade, and policy'' section of the CSREES research grants, which currently is undersubscribed. It is also my hope that the additional research funds that I sought for another ongoing CSREES research project to help farmers reduce their use of fertilizer and pesticide inputs can be secured in conference.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her tremendous leadership on this issue and so many other consumer protection issues. She is leading the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations with tremendous distinction, with great strength, and the consumers of this Nation are all better off because of that leadership. This bill is a further example of that leadership. I am proud to be her principal cosponsor of the bill that we have worked on for so long. 
   Sweepstakes for many Americans has become a cruel joke. Americans are overwhelmed with sweepstakes solicitations in the mail that deceptively appear to promise large winnings but deliver only empty appeals for purchases of unneeded products and more entries into additional sweepstakes. 
   The majority of Americans may have a healthy skepticism about these solicitations and don't believe the misleading representations. But many are not so disbelieving, and they can get caught up and do get caught up in a spiral of financial and emotional trauma. 
   The subcommittee heard story after story before of seniors particularly, some of the most vulnerable people in America, who receive these mailings and believe that they have been awarded a prize. 
   Several of my constituents from Michigan lost tens of thousands of dollars to sweepstakes solicitations. 
   One woman in Grand Rapids spent over $12,000 in one year with Reader's Digest alone. 
   A woman in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan spent $30,000 in less than a month on sweepstakes-related promotions. 
   Sweepstakes solicitations are big business. Companies 
   using sweepstakes to promote their products, be it magazines or coupon books, or jewelry, send over a billion pieces of mail a year to American consumers. 
   We learned that one person could get from one company alone as much as 144 different pieces of sweepstakes mail in a year. That was from a so-called ``legitimate company.'' 
   Purchases through these types of mailings are in the billions of dollars. Sweepstakes are used as the ``come-on'' to get the recipient to purchase a product or make a contribution. They are used, companies say, to get the recipients to open the envelopes, and, once opened, used to get the person to respond with a purchase or contribution. Promoters argue that sweepstakes entrants buy these products because they want them or need them. 
   Our investigation demonstrated that many people who enter these sweepstakes purchase items only because they think doing so will improve their chances of winning the sweepstakes prize. A large number buy and buy and buy, spending tens of thousands of dollars, with that expectation that the purchase of items will help improve their chances of winning. 
   Companies are not allowed by law to use the U.S. mails to conduct a lottery. A lottery is where payment must be given in order to have a chance to win. It is illegal for a sweepstakes promotor to require a purchase in order for a person to have a chance to win or to improve a person's chances of winning.  Buying something when entering a sweepstakes cannot, by law, do anything to improve a person's chances of winning. Many people don't know that or believe a purchase will improve their chance and many sweepstake companies try to leave the impression that buying something will give that recipient an advantage. 
   Sweepstake companies encourage this in many ways. For example, some use different envelopes for those who buy a product and those who don't. Here is an example from Reader's Digest. They send two envelopes. If a person orders something, the envelope says: Yes, Reward Entitlement [underlined], Granted and Guaranteed. If a person does not order something, the envelope says: No Reward Entitlement, Denied and Unwarranted. 
   They go to different post office boxes, clearly leaving a very different impression. It is a very strong different impression and a very deceptive different impression. 
   Other sweepstake companies use their own envelope and address card for those entering the sweepstake without 
   purchasing a product. In another sweepstakes, they are given an envelope if they want to buy something; if they don't want to buy something but still enter, they have to fill out their own envelope or their own card, which is much more difficult than if they are simply buying a product. 
   Some companies try to confuse the message, leaving the recipient to believe he has to pay a fee to collect a prize that he has already won. This certificate from the ``Motor Vehicle Awards'' states: [You] are guaranteed to receive a brand-new automobile or a cash award. 
   The first envelope has the name of the person receiving it, so it is very personalized: [Mr. or Miss Someone] are guaranteed to receive a brand-new automobile or cash award. 
   They ask the recipient to confirm that his name is spelled correctly on the certificate and to indicate how he wants the car delivered. In the very last paragraph it says: In addition, an optional commodities package with a fully redeemable value of over $2,500 is being held pending your submission of the standard acquisition fee. 
   The impression is that the recipient has won a car, that all he has to do is return the certificate for the car, and pay an acquisition fee. Of course, the impression they attempt to create--and often do, according to our testimony--is that acquisition fee relates to the car. 
   If he does that, the impression is he will receive a car and the commodities package. That is a pretty good bargain, at $14.98 for a car and commodities package. In reality, this is a sales promotion for the commodities package connected to a sweepstake. The acquisition fee of $14.98 is buying the commodities package. The commodities package is nothing more than a booklet of coupons that require buying items in order to redeem the coupons. 
   One must spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars for items that you don't need in order to receive the savings that are promised. Yet we learned at our hearings this is a very common sweepstakes scheme. Honest businesses don't engage in these practices, or they shouldn't. Over and over we heard from victims of the deceptive sweepstakes packages that they thought they had to buy something to receive the big prize or to improve their chances of winning. The sweepstake companies are very artful at creating this impression. This is about stringing people along. Often the people being strung along are the most vulnerable. 
   This is a promotion from Reader's Digest to a constituent of mine whose house is filled to the brim with tapes, books, CDs, and magazines she bought believing it would help her get the prize. This is a Certificate of Recognition for her loyalty to Reader's Digest: Dear valued customer: You've been selected to receive one of our highest honors--the Reader's Digest Recognition Reward. It's your obvious love of Reader's Digest and sweepstakes that made you an ideal candidate. In fact, it was your recent subscription request that finalized our decision. 
   In other words, keep buying and we will keep sending opportunities to win a sweepstake. It is buying the Reader's Digest that they are saying gets the special treatment. What is the Reader's Digest Recognition Award? It is a little stick 'em label that is pulled off this letter that has my constituent's name on it so she can paste it on any article of furniture around her house. It really is a come-on, an opportunity to 
   enter yet another sweepstake. That is the award, a little stick 'em that Mrs. Roosenberg got for spending over $12,000 in 1 year for products she didn't even open, filling up her house. 
   Through the artful placement of words and graphics, the sweepstakes companies make the reader believe they have won. They use such large screaming headlines: [Mr. X] is Officially Declared $833,337 Winner. 
   A big headline you can't miss. However, one misses the fine print that says, no, you haven't--only if you held the right number. What jumps out is the headline that you have won. 
   Our sweepstakes promoters try to make their envelopes look special, not like the bulk mail which they are, or try to make them look like a Government document, or even in the case of a recent Publishers Clearinghouse envelope, as if they were photographs that the recipient paid to have developed. This envelope looks exactly like envelopes received from the photo store. In fact, this is one of these sweepstake offers from Publishers Clearinghouse. 
   We cannot control each and every trick that a company uses to get the recipient of a sweepstakes promotion to buy something. However, there are some things we can and we should insist upon. We can insist that the companies state clearly and conspicuously that buying something will not improve a person's chances of winning. We can insist that these companies state clearly and conspicuously that you don't need to buy anything to win. We can make these companies state clearly and conspicuously what are the odds of winning. In many cases, the odds are nearly 1 in 100 million or 1 in 150 million. We can also require the sweepstake promoters not tell a person they have won if they haven't and not use devices to suggest that the mail is from a Government agency. That will hopefully alert the folks receiving the sweepstakes promotion and will help them think twice before buying items they really do not want and do not need. 
   In the last Congress, several of our colleagues joined in sponsoring a bill to increase enforcement of deceptive mailings by the Postal Service. 
   This, year Senator COLLINS held hearings on sweepstakes and other forms of deceptive mail. We have introduced two bills to try to eliminate deceptive sweepstakes practices. Senator COLLINS' bill is S. 335; my bill is S. 336. We learned during the hearings that the financial costs to consumers for deceptive and fraudulent sweepstakes is a serious problem and one that particularly plagues our senior citizens. We learned that the Postal Service has inadequate law enforcement tools to effectively shut down deceptive direct marketers who use deceptive sweepstakes promotions to sell their products. We also learned that the Postal Service can't impost a fine against such a promoter until the Postal Service has issued a stop order, and the stop order has been violated. Wily promoters craft their mailing so that it technically complies with a particular stop order but is this deceptive? Thus, time and time again these promoters continue to prey on Americans, and the postal Service has been all but powerless to stop them. 
   The bill before us is a combination of our two bills. It establishes a special provision in law for deceptive sweepstakes mailings, requires certain disclosures to be clearly and conspicuously displayed in key parts of the sweepstakes promotion; prohibits other misleading and deceptive statements in the promotion; gives the Postal Service additional enforcement tools, and requires sweepstakes promoters to provide a mechanism for a recipient of mail to remove his or her name off a mailing list if requested. 
   Mr. President, what is the time situation?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 10 additional minutes. 
   Three key provisions in S. 336 have been incorporated into the substitute. First, to prevent unscrupulous mailers from duping people into believing that a purchase will increase their chances  of winning, the bill requires that a statement that a purchase will not increase an individual's chances of winning be clearly and conspicuously displayed in a prominent place and manner in the mailing, in the rules, and on the order or entry form. 
   I believe of all of the new requirements and standards, this is perhaps the most important. The statement that a purchase will not increase an individual's chances of winning must not only be clearly and conspicuously displayed but also displayed in a prominent place and manner in the mailing, in the rules, and on the order or entry form. Such a statement will, hopefully, help readers dissociate the ordering process from the sweepstakes entry. 
   Second, it provides the Postal Service with the authority to issue a civil penalty for a first-time violation of the statute. This means the Postal Service does not have to first issue a stop order and then wait for that order to be violated before assessing civil penalties. This has the effect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not for noncompliance with the order. It makes enforcement a one-step instead of a two-step process. Third, it gives the Postal Service the subpoena authority it often needs to help identify sweepstakes scams. 
   Despite the specificity of the disclosures required under the bill, I remain quite concerned that the disclosures be noticeable and understandable to the reader. That is why the bill requires all disclosures to be clearly and conspicuously displayed. With a managers' amendment, we define ``clearly and conspicuously displayed'' in the bill so that there can be no misunderstanding by the Postal Service and the direct mail industry as to what we mean. Furthermore, two critical disclsoures--``no purchase necessary'' and ``a purchase will not increase an individual's chances of winning''--are required to be not only ``clearly and conspicuously displayed'' but ``prominently'' displayed as well. This means that these two diclsoures must be highly visible to and easily noticeable by the reader. These important messages will not be allowed to be hidden or disguised through illegible print size, glitzy displays which detract from the disclosure, or barely noticeable ink color. 
   The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999 takes a tough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other games of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use sweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a legitimate product, provide adequate disclosure, and abide with Postal Service regulations, then the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation without any interruption. If deceptive practices are used in a sweepstakes or game of chance solicitation, the Postal Service will be able to stop the solicitation and impose a significant penalty. 
   I again thank Senator COLLINS again for her hard work and commitment to consumers in this legislation. I also thank Senator COCHRAN for his early support and Senator EDWARDS for his excellent work on the provision requiring a delisting of persons not wanting to receive sweepstakes mailings. Finally, I want to thank the staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the terrific job they did putting together the hearings and developing this legislation. In particular I want to thank Linda Gustitus and Leslie Bell of the minority staff, Lee Blaylock and Kirk Walder of the majority staff, and Maureen Mahon of Senator EDWARDS' staff. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time as Senator COLLINS has indicated, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, during the July 1999 hearing on deceptive mail held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, several promoters testified that they use different business names and different stationery to send to the same people different-looking mailings to promote the same sweepstakes. So, for example, on day one, a person can get a solicitation to enter a $10,000 sweepstakes, and the solicitation says on the top that ``Company Blue'' is making the offer. In the rules it says ``your chances of winning are 1 in 3 million.'' Let's say you enter that sweepstakes. One week later you get another solicitation for a $10,000 sweepstakes. 
   And we learned that the standard operating procedure for this type of sweepstakes is to send 5 or 6 mailings for the same sweepstakes after the person responds to the first mailing. 
   So on this second mailing, it says ``Company Red'' at the top and the materials look totally different from the ``Company Blue'' promotions. The rules of this second solicitation also say you have a 1 in 3 million chance of winning $10,000, which a reasonable person would think is a completely different sweepstakes. That's also what the promoter wants you to think. So you think you have a chance of winning $20,000 in total. But, you don't. The most you can win is $10,000. 
   I believe these mailings are misrepresenting the facts, and under existing law these misrepresentations are deceptive. For example, in the ``Company Blue'' and ``Company Red'' scenario I just described, the promoter wants you to think that you're receiving two separate solicitations, each involving two separate sweepstakes. In fact, the solicitations for ``Company Blue'' and ``Company Red'' are for the same sweepstakes and thus you can win only once. Section 3005 of title 39 currently allows the Postal Service to deny delivery of mail used as part of a scheme to obtain money through the mail by means of false representations. Clearly many sweepstakes promoters use different business names and different stationery to make you think their multiple solicitations are unique and have no relationship to each other. 
   Does the Senator from Maine agree that these multiple mailing schemes mislead people into thinking they are entering separate contests from different companies?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our bill requires a sweepstakes or skill contest promotion, in order to be mailable matter, to contain a number of specific disclosures. Each of the disclosures required by the bill must be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' We have defined that term in the bill to mean ``readily noticeable, readable, and understandable.'' This is a definition consistent with the definition used by the Federal Trade Commission. 
   Two of the required disclosures--that no purchase is necessary to win and that purchasing does not improve your chances of winning--are so important to giving a consumer the information he or she needs to decide whether or not to enter a sweepstakes and if so, whether or not to purchase an advertised product--that they should appear prominently in three places in each mailing. Our addition of the term ``prominently'' to these two disclosures is intended to emphasize the heightened significance of these disclaimers. This means that these two disclosures must be highly visible and highly noticeable to the reader. In Edgeworth v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 673 F. Supp. 922, 923 (N.D. Ill. 1987), rev. on other grounds, 683 F. Supp. 1193 (1988), the District Court defined ``prominent and accessible place'' to mean that the message conveyed can readily be observed by the people for whom it is intended. In Allstate Insurance Co. v. Clemmons, 742 F. Supp. 1073, 1075 (D.NV 1990), the District Court defined ``prominently displayed'' to mean ``the message must have greater prominence than the balance of the policy language....... In other words, a clause attains prominence by being different from its surrounding terms.'' ``Prominently'' requires, for purposes of our bill, making the two disclosures to which ``prominently'' applies different from other messages in appearance, manner of presentation, and location. These two disclosures must stand out from the rest of the printed material on the three locations where they are required to appear. 
   One can argue that there is going to be some subjectivity in deciding whether a statement is prominently placed in a promotion or not. Our intention here is to provide the Postal Service with enough guidance to ensure that when it comes to these two disclosures, there should be no close calls. These two disclosures should be obviously clearly and conspicuously displayed in a prominent manner and location. 
   Does the Senator from Maine agree with my description?

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I again commend Senator COLLINS for her really strong leadership of our subcommittee in so many consumer protection measures. This is just the latest of many on which Senator COLLINS has been the leader. That leadership is critically important to the American people. I commend her on it. 
   I also want to single out Senator EDWARDS. He made a major contribution to this bill by making it possible for people who no longer want to receive these sweepstakes to call a phone number to stop the deluge of mail which is received in so many homes. As in so many other areas, he is already making a great contribution to this Senate. I especially thank him for his contribution to this bipartisan bill. That part of this bill is a very important part. It is a very creative part of the bill. Again, it makes it possible, in a very practical way, for people who get sick and tired of the swamping of their mailboxes with these sweepstakes offers, to end that. 
   This bill attempts to end these sweepstakes swindles which are swamping our Nation. The sweepstakes scams are part of a $1 billion industry, an industry which is too often based on deception, an industry which too often tells people they have won a prize, dangles in front of them that promised prize, and then, of course, encloses the promotional materials that create the impression that buying a product will help to get that prize. 
   Most people are skeptical when they get this mail. They realize there could be 100,000 people who are told they have just won a huge amount of money, but there is a significant percentage of our people who are misled. The companies that do this prey on some of the most vulnerable among us and they take special advantage of our seniors. This is shown, in particular, when somebody responds to one of these promotions and then they are frequently inundated with followup targeted promotions. In fact, according to one of our witnesses, one person could get as many as 144 mailings from one company in 1 year and that, by the way, is one of the larger companies that does that, one of the so-called legitimate companies. 
   Our bill is aimed at ending the abuses and the deceptions and the scams. It will require the companies that are using these sweepstakes to display clearly and conspicuously and in a prominent place and in a prominent manner a statement that no purchase is necessary to enter the contest and, even more important, in my judgment at least, a statement saying that a purchase will not improve their chances of winning. 
   There are other requirements in this bill, and they are important requirements, but I think those are two of the most important requirements that we do now impose on an industry to see if we can clean up some of these abuses. 
   We also give the Postal Service some long-needed tools to put the scam artists out of business. The Postal Service will have subpoena authority. The Postal Service will no longer have to take two steps before clamping down on the deception; they will be able to do it in one step. If the representation is deceptive and violates our bill, the Postal Service will be able to end it directly and not have to first go through an order which, in turn, will have to be violated as is the current law. 
   If someone violates the law, they should not need two steps. One step ought to be enough to stop the violation and punish the perpetrator. This bill is intended to close the loopholes in our law, to end the deceptions that permit too many of these sweepstakes to take in too many people, usually too many vulnerable people, raising hundreds of millions of dollars from people who usually cannot afford the dollars they are scammed into sending to the deceptive mailers of some of these sweepstakes. 
   Madam President, again, I commend the Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, for her very strong leadership, and the other members of our committee who have participated, including Senator COCHRAN who has been a leader in this  and, again, Senator EDWARDS for his major contribution to this bill. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join in cosponsoring the Hollings motion to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to defer tax reductions in order to reduce the national debt. I cosponsored the Hollings motion in lieu of calling up the Lieberman-Levin amendment because the effect of the Hollings motion, had it been adopted, would have been largely the same as the Lieberman-Levin amendment. 
   The tax program before the Senate is unfair to middle income Americans, it is economically unwise and it's based on unrealistic assumptions. The unfairness is perhaps best shown by the fact that about two-thirds of its tax benefits go to the upper one-fifth of our  people. In addition to being unfair, it is economically unwise in that jeopardizes Medicare, fails to strengthen Social Security, and risks higher interest rates. 
   This bill takes us back to the bad old days of backloaded tax breaks whose real costs explode several years after enactment. This budgetary time bomb is set to go off at roughly the same time as the Medicare trust fund is expected to be bankrupt and the bill begins to come due for Social Security. In that decade, as the ``baby boomers'' begin to retire, the Social Security Trust fund will begin to run a deficit, requiring the redemption of Treasury bonds which it holds. 
   It is also based on unrealistic projections. Projections are always risky. We have seen many federal budget estimates, and we know well that as quickly as these surpluses appear, they can disappear. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan introduced his Economic Recovery Tax Act which included huge tax cuts and predictions that the budget would be balanced by 1984. In 1981, I opposed the Reagan tax cut because I was convinced that it would lead to huge deficits. We have paid dearly for the debt which resulted from that legislation. In 1992, the deficit in the federal budget was $290 billion. The remarkable progress which has brought us now to the threshold of surpluses has come about in large part as a result of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in 1993, and which this Senate passed by a margin of one vote, the Vice-President's. We should not now, by passing a tax bill like the one before us, head back down the road toward new future deficits. 
   I joined with Senator HOLLINGS in his motion to defer the tax cut, because it seems clear to me that we should first see if the surplus is real before we adopt tax cuts; second, if those surpluses are real, we should pay down the national debt faster; and third, we should save tax cuts for a time of economic slow down. 
   During the consideration of this legislation and the national debate which has surrounded it, much has been made of the projected reduction of the national debt and concurrent reductions in interest payments. Although the debt held by the public, or the so-called external debt, is projected to be paid down by the surpluses accumulated in the Social Security Trust Funds, interest paid to the Social Security Trust funds in the form of bonds will continue to increase for more than a decade. At that time, in approximately 2014, unless Social Security reform has been accomplished, the Trust Funds will no longer be in surplus, but instead there will be a shortfall in those funds. As the bonds held by the Social Security Trust Funds are redeemed, we will therefore begin paying a portion of the interest owed to the Social Security Trust Funds, and eventually all of the interest owed to the Social Security Trust Funds, in cash. Also, we will then have to redeem the trillions of dollars of bonds representing principal owed to the trust funds.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New York. 
   The tax program which is in the amendment before the Senate, like the plan that it would amend, is unfair to middle-income Americans. It is economically unwise, and it is based on unrealistic assumptions. The unfairness in the underlying bill it would amend is perhaps best shown in the fact that about two-thirds of its tax benefits go to the upper one-fifth of our people. The amendment makes that worse. It makes an unfairness doubly unfair because it will give almost 80 percent of the tax benefits to the upper one-fifth of the income bracket. 
   In addition to being unfair, it is also economically unwise because it jeopardizes Medicare, it fails to strengthen Social Security, and it risks higher interest rates. Yesterday, Alan Greenspan, testifying before the Banking Committee said:  
   We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut.  
   Why? Because of the uncertainty of budget surplus projections and also because we should normally reserve tax cuts for periods of economic slowdown. 
   The implication, in his words, has also been pretty clear over these last few months, which is that a large tax cut would cause the Fed to increase interest rates. For the average middle-income taxpayers, a rise in interest rates means larger mortgage payments, larger loan and credit card payments, larger payments on that automobile, and that would far outweigh the small share of the benefits from the tax cut which that average taxpayer might receive. 
   The tax program that is being offered to us is also based on unrealistic projections. Projections are always risky. We have seen many Federal budget estimates, and we know that as quickly as the surpluses appear, they can disappear. The estimates of both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget have frequently been far off the mark in recent years, and that is not their fault. We have some bright economists in the CBO and the OMB. They have a difficult task. Forecasting the performance of the economy, particularly over the course of several years, is more art than science, and there is a lot of guesswork in it. 
   For instance, the CBO estimated that the unified budget surplus for fiscal year 2000 will be $79 billion. But 4 months later, in a January 1999 CBO document, the surplus for fiscal year 2000 was estimated at $130 billion. In 4 months, it jumped from a $79 billion estimate to a $130 billion estimate. The July estimate for fiscal year 2000 now projects a $161 billion surplus. So there has been a change of over 100 percent in the projection of the surplus in less than a year. If most Americans were confronted with such uncertainty over their own budget situation, they would follow a cautious course, and we should, too. 
   The projections in both the underlying proposal and the pending amendment to it are extremely risky because they are based on assumptions about domestic spending levels that are highly unrealistic. The on-budget surplus, which the Republicans now say will pay for the tax cut, is reliant largely on massive cuts in discretionary spending, $595 billion over 10 years. That is a 23-percent cut in real terms from the 1999 level adjusted for inflation. Can we really believe we will be cutting discretionary programs by 23 percent in real terms? 
   Is that what we are doing now? 
   If a realistic defense spending level is adopted--even the President's proposal; if we assume just that--the domestic spending cut will grow to $775 billion over 10 years, which is a 38-percent cut in real terms. 
   We have seen proof in the last few weeks that these levels are unrealistic. The so-called spending caps are already being exceeded by attaching emergency spending labels to new funding. We have already heard from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that these limits, or caps, are going to be lifted in any event. The House tends to use emergency spending to get around the caps. Apparently, we are going to be more forthright and just lift the caps. 
   So most people in Congress already believe--whether they acknowledge this publicly or not--that the caps are simply not going to hold. So we already have strong evidence that the basis of the surplus projection is not realistic or credible. 
   The proposal before us is going to take the economy backwards, just as we are climbing out of a deficit ditch. 
   In 1992, the deficit in the Federal budget was $290 billion. We made remarkable progress which has brought us now to the threshold of surpluses. It came in large part because of a deficit-reduction package which President Clinton presented in 1993 and which we passed by a margin of one vote. We should not now, by passing a tax bill such as the one before us, head down the road toward new future deficits. 
   The alternative that Democrats offered yesterday was far better, by all three tests--the test of fairness, the test of prudence, the test of credibility. But by those same three tests, we should hold off on any tax cut. We should hold off on any tax cut, period. 
   First, we should see if the surplus is real before we adopt tax cuts. Second, if the surpluses are real, we should pay down the national debt faster. And third, we should save tax cuts for a time of economic slow down. 
   The argument is made that this is the taxpayers' money. It is. But the economy is the American taxpayers', too. The economy belongs to the American taxpayer. Social Security belongs to the American people, just as this money belongs to the American people. The surplus belongs to the American people. So does the Medicare program belong to the American people. Our education program, helping people through college, belongs to the American people, just as the surplus does. 
   These are taxpayers' dollars. There can be no dispute about that. But the veterans' program is the American people's program. When we cut veterans' health care, we are cutting into something that the American people want. It is their program, just as the surplus, just as the taxes, are the American people's. 
   The American people are speaking loudly, at least to me, at least in my office, when I go back home to Michigan every weekend and talk to the American people. What they are telling me is: Pay down the debt, protect Social Security, protect Medicare. Do what you need to do to invest in education. Don't cut veterans' programs. But we don't need this tax cut that is being proposed at this time, not just because it is unfair to middle income Americans--which it is, since most of the benefits go to the upper fifth--but we don't need the tax cut because we want debt reduction, real debt reduction.  
   That is what they are telling us. That is what the American people, who produced this surplus, who send us the tax money, are telling us. They are telling us that loudly, not just in public opinion polls--in the mail that we open up, in the phone calls we get, and in the personal pleas we get when we go home. 
   That is exactly what we should do: To hold off on any tax cut and reduce the debt with the money that otherwise would go to that tax cut, again, not just because it is unfair--which it is--but because it is unwise and imprudent. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no way to measure the costs of gun crime in our society. There are estimates that put the price at $75 billion for one year of pain, suffering, and loss of quality of life caused by gun violence, but there is no real way to determine the incalculable human cost of gun-related crime. There is, however, a method to measure other financial costs associated with firearm crime. For instance, the estimated cost of health care for firearms related injuries in the United States was $4 billion in 1995. The average per-person cost of a firearm fatality is $373,000 per death, higher than any injury-related death. And, on average, it costs more than $14,000 to treat each child wounded by a firearm. 
   Cities spend millions each year on these costs and others associated with gun related emergencies. The expenses incurred by cities include medical treatment for victims, additional police protection, and counseling services for survivors of murder victims. These additional costs are the basis of the class-action lawsuits against the firearm manufacturers, distributors and dealers. Nearly two dozen local governments, including Wayne County and Detroit, have filed suit against the manufacturers and distributors of firearms to recoup the costs of firearm related crime. And following their lead, the NAACP filed a lawsuit that does not seek monetary damages, but instead, seeks to put an end to the emotional costs of gun violence incurred by the African-American community. 
   The recent wave of class-action lawsuits against the firearms industry are based on the industry's failure to monitor the transmission of their product to the underground markets. These class-action lawsuits seek to alter the marketing, distribution and sales of firearms. More specifically, they are an attempt to remedy the industry's failure to prevent unauthorized users from obtaining access to firearms, change the distribution system that permits firearms to be easily trafficked from the legal marketplace to the illegal marketplace, and eliminate deceptive advertising regarding the risks posed by having firearms in the home. Stated simply, these lawsuits are about distributing firearms responsibly. 
   The NAACP lawsuit is slightly different because it does not seek to recover monetary damages, but the effect of the lawsuit would be the same. It seeks to change the sale, marketing, and distribution of the gun industry, whose alleged negligence permits the free flow of weapons in to the hands of juveniles and criminals. It asks for a court order to limit the number of firearms a single buyer can purchase each month and would require gun manufacturers to train retailers about ``straw'' purchases, and supervise the sales practices of firearms distributors and retailers. It would also require that dealers operate from a fixed retail location, and ensure that handguns are manufactured with safety devices. 
   If the gun industry is found liable, it will draw a direct line of responsibility from the gun manufacturers to the unscrupulous distributors and dealers who provide firearms to felons. The gun industry would no longer be able to oversupply certain markets, thereby allowing guns to flow into the hands of juveniles and criminals. Manufacturers would no longer be able to turn a blind eye to the carnage produced by their products. If the gun industry is found liable, it may put an end to a majority of the gun violence caused by the unlawful, unregulated, underground firearm market.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, small businesses are the biggest job producers in our economy and technology is an increasingly important component to those growth figures. Contributing to that continued high technology job growth is a high technology procurement program that allows small and innovative high technology companies to bid on some of the federal government's research and development proposals. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program gives these small technology companies a tool to compete in the big leagues by giving them fairer access to federal research and a way to finance that research in order to commercialize it. It also gives the federal government access to highly innovative companies that can custom design and develop specialized technology for an agency's specific needs--something bigger companies may not be able to do as well. 
   The SBIR program does this by mandating that each federal agency with a research and development budget that is contracted to outside vendors in excess of $100 million designate 2.5 percent of this budget for awards to small businesses. Currently there are 10 federal agencies participating in the SBIR program. A smaller component of this program is the Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR), which allows 5 agencies to allocate three twentieths of one percent of these funds to small businesses that partner with non-profit institutions to do the research and development. 
   The SBIR program creates jobs, increases our capacity for technological innovation and boosts our international competitiveness. According to an April 1998 GAO study, about 50 percent of SBIR research is commercialized or receives additional research funding. That's a pretty good success rate. It's also a great example of federal agencies working together with small businesses to develop technologies to solve specific problems and fill government procurement needs in a cost effective way. 
   The SBIR and STTR programs are successful programs and we can make them even more successful by establishing a volunteer mentoring program. Such a program would partner CEOs of small high technology companies that have successfully completed a SBIR or STTR program with small businesses in low participation areas to guide them through the process, increasing their chances for success and, ultimately, the commercialization of their research. 
   Many states believe they can do better regarding the number of SBIR awards their small businesses win. Since the SBIR and STTR programs are highly competitive and merit-based programs and should remain so, I believe the best way to increase participation is through outreach and mentoring. My bill would target its mentoring program to low participation areas which receive a disproportionately low number of SBIR awards as compared with other areas in the state or in the country. 
   Michigan is just one example of a state which has many low participation areas within it that could improve their participation in the program. In 1997 Michigan small businesses nevertheless won 102 SBIR awards worth a total of $24.6 million, ranking it 14th nationally. But Michigan should be doing better. Based on its population, Michigan ranks 8th nationally, not 14th as it does in number of SBIR awards. I believe the volunteer mentoring program I am proposing will help small high technology businesses from those areas within Michigan and around the country that lack access to research universities, venture capital or other resources to increase their chances of participating successfully in this program. 
   Last summer, the Senate Small Business Committee held an SBIR oversight hearing to begin to develop a hearing record in preparation for SBIR's reauthorization. At that hearing, GAO presented a study favorably reviewing the program. It pointed out, however, that because agencies are adhering to the program requirements that they not use SBIR funds to pay for the administrative costs of the program, this funding restriction has limited their ability to provide some needed administrative support. For example, some agencies reported they do not have the necessary funds to provide personnel to act as mentors to their SBIR companies or engage in activities that could possibly increase the program's success in phase III. GAO also said the lack of administrative support means agencies are unable to provide SBIR participants with much-needed 
   training in business skills. A volunteer mentoring program could fill this void. 
   Also at that hearing, a number of Senators expressed a desire to see more geographical distribution of SBIR awards and hearing witnesses suggested this could be addressed through outreach to make more high technology small businesses aware of the program. A natural complement to reaching out to new companies to tell them about the SBIR and STTR programs is the establishment of a mentoring program to increase their odds for success in those programs. 
   Many SBIR-company CEOs have benefitted from the program, are committed to its success and have told me they want to give something back. They propose doing this in the way of mentoring small businesses that are new to the SBIR process. The bill I am introducing today would establish a program to coordinate that process and reimburse volunteer mentors for their out-of-pocket-expenses. It would also address the desire to expand participation in the program by targeting the mentoring to low participation areas. 
   I am pleased to have the Senate Small Business Committee Ranking Member, JOHN KERRY, join me as an original cosponsor of this bill. My legislation also has the support of key members of the SBIR community.  
   My bill would establish a Mentoring program where past SBIR and STTR recipients partner with new applicant companies in low participation areas to help guide them through the process and increase their chances of success. A small business's failure to obtain a phase I or Phase II award may have nothing to do with the capability of its technology but rather is often a result of a lack of understanding the government procurement process and procedures. This mentoring program would help bring new companies into the SBIR program from areas that have not traditionally participated at high rates. It would also increase Phase III awards and commercialization of the technology being developed. 
   Specifically, my bill would establish a competitively bid volunteer mentoring grant program for the SBIR and STTR programs. The Small Business Administration would be responsible for administering the program. Organizations representing SBIR and STTR awardees could apply for grants ranging from $50,000 -$200,000 to participate in the program. Qualifying organizations would match small businesses in low participation areas new to the SBIR/STTR process with CEOs and others of small, high technology companies that have successfully completed one or more SBIR/STTR contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. The ``volunteer mentors'' would be reimbursed only for their out-of-pocket expenses. Their time, energy and know-how would be donated free-of-charge. The program would be authorized at $1 million per year to cover administration of the program and reimbursement of volunteer mentors for their out-of-pocket expenses. 
   There are a number of effective organizations and entities representing SBIR and STTR companies that would be eligible to apply for the program. This legislation is intended to attract organizations such as the Small Business Technology Coalition, various regional groups or entities working with SBIR companies as well as some technology oriented specialized Small Business Development Centers, and others. Some of these eligible entities and organizations may even chose to partner together in a collaborative effort to apply to the program. 
   The SBIR program, originally established in 1982 and reauthorized and expanded in 1992, expires in fiscal year 2000. This highly competitive program has a well deserved reputation for success and has enjoyed bipartisan support over the years. I hope my bill can be included in that reauthorizing legislation to improve what is already a successful program giving small high technology companies access to federal research and development and the federal government access to some of the world's best innovation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the Fourth of July weekend, the nation was stunned by the actions of a single young man on a racially motivated killing spree. The man's name was Benjamin Smith, and it seems clear, he spent his short life consumed by hatred. Because of this hatred, the nation mourns the death of a former University of Detroit and Western Michigan University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong and doctoral student Won-Joon Yoon, both the victims of hate crime. 
   Benjamin Smith was just one of many who unleashed his hate onto others through violence. According to FBI statistics, at least one hate crime occurs every hour in the United States. That means at least one violent crime each hour is motivated by bias. Hate crimes have no place in a society founded on tolerance and equality. There must be a clear message to hate-mongers like Benjamin Smith, that the federal government will do everything in its power so that the perpetrators of bias crimes will be investigated, prosecuted and punished as quickly as possible. But the federal government is limited to a certain extent in its ability to assist state and local prosecutors in their investigations of hate crime. 
   That's why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Hate Crimes Protection Act, a bill which would amend the existing federal hate crimes law and expand the federal government's role in the investigation and prosecution of bias-inspired conduct. The federal government has always had a special role in stifling violence and discriminatory treatment. This Act continues in that tradition by strengthening federal authority to ensure that racially-motivated criminals are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 
   This amendment would also expand the definition of hate crime, which now only pertains to the victim's race, color, religion and natural origin, to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender, and disability. By expanding the definition of hate crime, the nation sends a clear message that it will not tolerate any violent crime, especially targeted at those who have traditionally been more vulnerable to violence. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act has the support of over 100 civil rights and law enforcement organizations, as well  as a broad range of state and local government associations, and state Attorneys General. These groups, who work with the victims of hate crimes on a daily basis, understand that violent hate crimes, not only affect the victim's family, but are injurious to the entire community. Because hate crimes have a such a deep impact on society, these civil rights and law enforcement organizations support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and the role it gives the federal government in ensuring that perpetrators of bias crime are subject to enhanced prosecutions and penalties. 
   I am pleased to join a distinguished list of cosponsors on this amendment and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this Act and take a stand against hate crime.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, California Governor Gray Davis signed into law two of the strictest gun control measures in the country. One of these laws is the nation's most comprehensive ban on assault weapons, and the other prohibits the purchase of more than one handgun a month. 
   California residents support these common sense safety measures designed to take lethal, semiautomatic weapons off the streets, and reduce illegal gun trafficking. Californians feel strongly about ending the easy accessibility of guns because of their history with gun violence over this last decade. In 1989, Americans were shocked when a madman walked into a schoolyard in Stockton, CA, with a rapid-firing AK-47 and shot off 50 rounds a minute for 2 minutes, killing 5 children and wounding 30. Californians were again struck by tragedy in a 1993 massacre at a San Francisco law firm in which 8 people died and 6 were wounded, and again in 1997, when a high profile armed bank robbery spilled out on to the streets of North Hollywood. 
   As always, NRA lobbyists were working to undermine the effort of the California state legislature. But because gun violence has held such a prominent and tragic place in the minds and hearts of Californians, the legislature was able to defy the NRA and pass these responsible gun control measures. So many families in California have been torn apart by gun violence, and so many people have been affected by the weak gun control laws in this nation, that the NRA failed in the California state legislature. 
   I hope that other states will follow the lead of the California state legislature and pass responsible gun control measures. I pray that they learn from the tragedies in California, rather than wait for a decade of tragedies to occur in their own states, before passing responsible safety measures. I also make an appeal to my Congressional colleagues to pass sensible gun control legislation now. Although in this case, the debate on gun violence has moved to the state legislature, Congress has not been absolved of its responsibility.  We must end the plague of gun violence that claims so many innocent lives.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is not often an amendment is read in its entirety around here, even a short one. Usually we ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. I do not know how many times I have used those words on this floor in the last 20 years. But in this case I decided to have this amendment--it is fairly short--read in its entirety because it may sound familiar to some people. 
   These are Senator Rudman's words. This amendment incorporates some very important parts of Senator Rudman's panel's recommendation that are left out of the pending amendment. That is why I wanted the entire amendment read. 
   The sponsors of this amendment have correctly pointed out that Senator Rudman is recommending a semiautonomous agency, and that is the heart of Senator Rudman's proposal. It happens to be a proposal that I support. But the difference between my position and the sponsor's position, relative to Senator Rudman's recommendations, is that their amendment leaves out some very critical recommendations of the Rudman panel relative to the operation of the Department of Energy. 
   My amendment would insert in the pending amendment some very important recommendations of the Rudman panel the pending amendment omits. 
   We have heard a lot relative to the importance of the Rudman panel recommendations. Senator Rudman and his panel performed an extremely important service to this Nation in pointing out the complicated bureaucratic maze that exists at the Department of Energy and pointing out that for 20 years, report after report, recommendation after recommendation to streamline the bureaucracy the Department of Energy have been made, including made to the Congress, without action being taken by the Congress. 
   All of us bear responsibility for that failure. Three administrations and 20 years of Congresses have been told in a number of reports there should be some reorganization done at the Department of Energy 
   Finally, a year and a half ago, President Clinton issued a Presidential directive that reorganizes the Department of Energy. That directive has been mainly implemented, not yet fully apparently but mainly implemented. The Rudman panel goes beyond that Presidential directive but does give credit to President Clinton for being the first President in 20 years to direct the reorganization of the Department of Energy, even though three Presidents have been told there is significant organizational problems, and even though as early as 1990 there was a public statement about espionage being carried out by the People's Republic of China at one of these labs. 
   Secretary Richardson is engaged in significant reorganization of this agency, and the Rudman panel gave credit to Secretary Richardson for beginning the important 
   reorganizational changes. 
   This Congress has taken some steps to reorganize the Department of Energy. The Armed Services Committee, for instance, upon which our Presiding Officer sits with distinction, has acted on our bill, which is now in conference, to carry out some significant reorganization of the Department of Energy. 
   On the House side, the Armed Services Committee did the same thing. The language is different. Parts of their provision differ from ours. But the point is, there are some very important things going on in terms of reorganization in the Department of Energy, as we speak. But the Rudman panel goes beyond that. It would put into law, for instance, things which are in an Executive order. We know how much more important a law is than an Executive order because an Executive order, No. 1, can be changed by the next President but, No. 2, can be too often ignored by the bureaucracy. We had a recent example of that in another agency where an agency just almost totally ignored an Executive order. 
   We want to put into law a significant reorganization, and we want to--at least I do, and I think most of my colleagues want to--put into law a reorganization along the lines of the Rudman panel recommendation. I do not know that there is any disagreement on that, but apparently there is a disagreement when it comes to setting forth not just the provisions of the Rudman panel's recommendations relative to the power of this new semiautonomous agency, but when it comes to setting forth the power of the Secretary of Energy relative to directing and controlling his Department. 
   What is left out in this amendment is also important, according to the Rudman panel. This is not the Senator from Michigan talking; this amendment is the Rudman panel talking. I will go into what these provisions are in just one moment. 
   I emphasize, the security breakdown that has existed for 20 years that was highlighted in the Cox commission report must be corrected. There are a number of steps underway to correct them, but we should act. There have been some pretty important, good-faith discussions going on over the last few days as to how we might be able to come up with a bill which can become law. 
   We can pass a bill, and if the House does not accept the bill because they think it ought to be a freestanding bill and not on an intelligence authorization bill, or because they do not think it ought to be on a Department of Defense authorization bill--and that is their position in conference relative to the defense authorization bill--we can attach language here. But if we do not have a strong, healthy consensus, it seems to me we are in a much weaker position in getting this law actually  passed in the House and signed by the President. That should be our goal. 
   If we are serious about trying to tighten up and streamline the Department of Energy, if we are serious about passing a law to do that, then we ought to figure out a way we can come together, incorporate the Rudman panel recommendations, including the ones which are left out in this amendment which I will try to add in a moment, so we can go to the House of Representatives with a healthy consensus vote, a strong vote, rather than a divided vote, and the same message would then be delivered to the President. 
   The Rudman report calls for a semiautonomous Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. I fully support that. That would be an 
   agency which will oversee all nuclear-related matters in the Department of Energy, including defense programs and nuclear nonproliferation. It would also oversee all functions of the national security labs and the weapons production facilities. I strongly support that. It would streamline the new Agency's management structure by abolishing ties between the weapons labs and all DOE regional field and site offices and all contractor intermediaries. It would appoint the Director of the new Agency by the President with Senate confirmation, and it would have effective administration of safeguard security and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by creating a coherent security counterintelligence structure within the new Agency. 
   In making the recommendation for a semiautonomous agency, the Rudman report cites as models similar agencies within the Department of Defense, such as the National Security Agency, NSA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, and the National Reconnaissance Office, the NRO. 
   Each of these three agencies is a separately organized agency run by an administrator within the Department of Defense. While the mission of each is different from the other, all three are under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense; all three are subject to Department of Defense policies and regulations; and all three are directed by the Secretary and his deputy through an assistant. 
   That is the model Senator Rudman has based his recommendation on--three agencies in the Department of Defense, separately organized, each having their own staff, but where the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary direct that separately organized agency through an assistant. 
   That is a very important part of that model which is omitted in this bill. So Senator Rudman and his panel, on June 30, sent a ``Memorandum of Clarification'' relative to their report. One of those recommendations in the statement is the following: ``The Secretary is still responsible,'' under their model, ``for developing and promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters,'' these matters being security, intelligence, and counterintelligence, ``and it makes sense to us,'' that is, the Rudman panel, ``that a Secretary would want advisers on his/her immediate staff to assist in that vein.'' 
   So the first sentence of our amendment says:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for developing and promulgating all Departmental-wide security, counterintelligence and intelligence policies, and may use his immediate staff to assist him in developing and promulgating such policies.  
   It is verbatim from Senator Rudman's panel's recommendation. 
   Senator Rudman's panel also says: ``..... The Agency Director,'' that is the new Agency, ``..... is responsible and held accountable for ensuring complete and faithful implementation of the Secretary's security, counterintelligence and intelligence policies within the new Agency.'' 
   The second sentence of our amendment reads:  
   The Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is responsible for implementation of the Secretary's security, counterintelligence, and intelligence policies within the New Agency. 
   Again, it is verbatim from the Rudman panel's memorandum of June 30. 
   The Rudman panel also said on that day that ``The Director of the Agency,'' that is, the new Agency ``may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.'' 
   The third line in our amendment says:  
   The Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.  
   It is verbatim from the Rudman panel recommendation. 
   I do not think we can have it both ways. The Rudman panel's recommendations are very important. We are not obligated to adopt every one. We are not obligated to adopt any of them. But there are some of us who believe those recommendations are hugely important. As always is the case when you create a new agency within a Department, you have to figure out a balance between the power of the new Agency and the power of the Secretary to run his Department that contains that new Agency. 
   That is a very important balance. We are doing it on the Senate floor. Usually that kind of a complex and rather arcane effort would be made by the Governmental Affairs Committee, but in this case, for many reasons, legitimate reasons, it comes to us in this form, and we must deal with it. 
   But in dealing with these issues, as to that balance, we have guidance. We have guidance from the Rudman panel. The Rudman panel says: Create a semiautonomous agency. It then goes into detail on the functions of that semiautonomous agency and the power both of its director and the Secretary of Energy. It sets them out. It lays this out for us. 
   The amendment before us omits some critically important recommendations of the Rudman panel, the ones I have just read and the ones that are in my amendment. It is that omission which, it seems to me, so flaws, and unnecessarily flaws, may I say, the amendment before us. 
   I do not quite fathom why it is that specific recommendations of the Rudman panel, relative to what the balance and the relationship are, should be omitted when they are important. 
   The sponsors of the amendment will no doubt say that the Secretary reserves the right in their amendment to direct and control the Department, and that is true. But when it comes down to putting any flesh on those bones, when it comes down to saying how the Secretary will do that--that he is able, for instance, to use his staff to promulgate policies, that the agency must comply with the Department's policies that apply departmentwide--when it comes to those things, then we have a problem with this amendment. 
   This amendment actually suggests the opposite is true from what Rudman has suggested when it says that ``The Secretary may not delegate to any Department official the duty to supervise or direct'' but leaves out the critically important power that Rudman would give the Secretary to utilize his staff to assist him in developing and promulgating departmentwide policies. 
   So we correct this omission. The spirit of Rudman is that there be a semiautonomous agency when it comes to spelling out 
   how that agency would function, what the balance of powers and functions would be between the Secretary of the Department, of which this agency is a part, and the new Agency Director. It is at that point that we have the omissions that Rudman recommends and the omissions in this pending amendment which my amendment would fill in. 
   Mr. President, I inquire how much time this Senator has left.

   Mr. LEVIN. Senator KERREY has expressed a desire to speak in support of the amendment. I will briefly yield 2 minutes to myself. Regarding the comments of the Senator from Illinois about both the President and the Secretary relative to the Secretary's actions, the PFIAB, or the Rudman report, as we call it, says the following:  
   We concur with and encourage many of Secretary Richardson's recent initiatives to address the security problem at the Department. And we are heartened by his aggressive approach and command of the issue. He has recognized the organizational dysfunction and cultural vagaries at the DOE and has taken strong, positive steps to try to reverse the legacy of more than 20 years of security mismanagement.  
   Now, the contrast between what the Rudman report says about Secretary Richardson and what the Senator from Illinois says the Rudman report said, relative to Secretary Richardson, is a pretty sharp contrast, indeed. This is what the Rudman panel actually said:  
   We concur with and encourage many of Secretary Richardson's recent initiatives to address the security problems at the Department. And we are heartened by his aggressive approach and command of the issues. He [Secretary Richardson] has recognized the organizational dysfunction and cultural vagaries at the DOE, and he [Secretary Richardson] has taken strong, positive steps to try to reverse the legacy of more than 20 years of security mismanagement.  
   I ask the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking Democrat, the vice chair of the committee, whether he wishes to speak at this time.

   Mr. LEVIN. If the suggestion is that the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies which are different from the policies which govern the rest of the Department with the approval of the Secretary--if that is the question, I see no difference between that and the last line because at that point those agency-specific policies are consistent with departmental policy. The departmental policy at that point is that that Agency will be governed by a different rule than the rest of the Department. I don't see any difference in terms of that concept with what is already in the last line. 
   The last part of that discussion I am not sure I fully follow. As far as that specific question is concerned, the Senator from Arizona is saying, as I understand it, and the Senator from Nebraska is responding in the following way: The Senator from Arizona says we want to make it possible for there to be an agency-specific policy that does differ with the departmentwide policy. My answer to that is, yes, providing it is approved by the head of the Department, at which point it is then Department policy that that separate agency have a different policy than the rest of the Department. 
   I have no problem with that.

   Mr. LEVIN. I want to see if both concur in this. 
   The Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies which are different from the general policy for the Department with the approval of the Secretary. 
   Those are not artfully perfect words, but that is the concept as I understood it that the Senator from Arizona is proposing. 
   I say to my dear friend from Nebraska, if that is what the Senator is proposing and with your intermediary help, that is fine with me.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, a unanimous consent request was propounded with respect to the Senate's consideration of campaign finance reform legislation. I objected to the request and I want to explain to my colleagues why I did so. 
   There is no more important work for this institution than passing campaign finance reform. Despite our good efforts in 1974, following the debacle of Watergate, to limit the influence of money in our political system, we are currently operating without effective limits. We have a law that sets out reasonable limits at $1,000 for individuals, $5,000 for PACs, and $25,000 to a national party. But those limits are easily evaded by the unlimited contributions of soft money. We have, in effect, no limits today. 
   The 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act has, in effect, been repealed. To return our elections to issues and people and away from money, we must pass campaign finance reform. Since the time agreement is critical to determining how and when we take up campaign finance reform, and perhaps its ultimate success, I wanted to be sure that I understood what the agreement contained. I objected initially on the basis of needing time to review the agreement. Having read the agreement, I do continue my objection to the original unanimous consent proposal, because I believe the agreement is inadequate for the necessary consideration of campaign finance reform. 
   I am well aware of the opponents' desire to filibuster the McCain-Feingold bill, a bill which is supported by a majority of the Members of the Senate. The opponents have every right to do that, and I respect that right. But supporters of campaign finance reform have every right not to back down in the face of a filibuster. 
   The unanimous consent agreement proposed that each of us agree that the McCain-Feingold proposal be withdrawn if we do not get 60 votes on the first try to close off a filibuster. But as long as we have a majority of the Members of the Senate supporting passage of campaign finance reform, we should be able to defeat efforts to withdraw the McCain-Feingold bill from Senate consideration. Opponents can filibuster, but supporters don't have to agree in advance to withdraw in the face of that filibuster. 
   The unanimous consent agreement, however, would require supporters to agree to withdraw if we don't achieve, on the first try, the 60 votes necessary to close off the filibuster. 
   The unanimous consent agreement said that not sooner than the third calendar day of consideration a cloture motion may be filed on the McCain-Feingold bill, and if cloture is not invoked, the bill will be placed back on the calendar. It then said that it will not be in order during the remainder of the first session of the 106th Congress for the Senate to consider issues relevant to campaign reform. This agreement would lock the Senate into relying on the one cloture vote to determine whether the fight for campaign finance reform, this year, lives or dies. 
   I cannot agree with that proposal. If we can't at first get 60 votes to close off the filibuster, I can't agree to putting the McCain-Feingold bill back on the calendar and just calling it quits for the year. The proposed time agreement would have us do that. 
   If it takes an all-out battle to keep campaign finance reform on the front burner of this Congress, I believe we should be prepared to wage such a battle. Opponents say they are prepared to wage such a battle in opposition. Supporters surely feel just as passionately in support of this bill as opponents do in opposition. 
   Another term of the agreement with respect to the consideration of amendments is also unacceptable to me. The proposed agreement says:  
   If an amendment is not tabled, it will be in order to lay aside such amendment for two calendar days.  
   The unusual provision allowing an amendment which the Senate has failed to table to be laid aside for 2 days puts in question whether such amendments will be voted on after they are not tabled prior to the cloture vote. I am afraid this provision would cause more mischief than facilitate serious consideration of key campaign finance issues. 
   I objected--and do object--to the unanimous consent agreement which was proposed yesterday. But I am, of course, willing to work with colleagues to try to address the concerns that I have. 
   Again, I want to emphasize that I am speaking as one Senator who was asked to participate in a unanimous consent agreement. The proponents, the sponsors of the bill, of course, with the leadership, have every right to work out any arrangement they see fit. 
   But to ask unanimous consent from this Senator to agree to proceeding in this form is something to which I objected, and do object, as a Senator. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the managers, the good Senators, who have worked very hard to adopt this language. 
   This implements the heart of the amendment which I previously offered. I want to read it so that people who are following this debate--it is very short--can understand why this is important. 
   The amendment reads:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for developing and promulgating Departmental security, counterintelligence and intelligence policies, and may use his immediate staff to assist him in developing and promulgating such policies.  
   With one minute change, that is the same sentence which was previously in my amendment. 
   The next sentence is:  
   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship is responsible for implementation of all security, counterintelligence and intelligence policies within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.  
   I think that is basically the previous language. 
   The one change is really in the third sentence, which is now with this amendment:  
   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship may establish agency-specific policies unless disapproved by the Secretary.  
   That was the intention of the third sentence in effect. Senator KYL thought it was an important change and would clarify a point. We accept that. 
   We thank Senator KYL, as well as our other colleague, Senator DOMENICI, and others who have worked on this language. This language is fully acceptable to me, because it does indeed carry out the language for the most part in the spirit, in toto, of the previous amendment. 
   I thank our colleagues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment makes it possible for the Secretary of Energy to fully utilize his Deputy Secretary. The Deputy Secretary of Energy, as with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is the No. 2 person in the Department. The Secretary of Energy simply must be allowed to rely on his deputy to serve in his absence, to help with the running of the Department when he is absent and, indeed, to effectively be his alter ego. 
   To be useful to the Secretary and perform his job, the Deputy Secretary must be involved fully in every facet of the business of the Department. This amendment will allow the Deputy Secretary to carry out that very important function. 
   The bill will now have that change, that the Secretary may not delegate to any departmental official other than the deputy the duty to service or direct the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   This is a very important change. I thank the managers for their support of this change. I believe it has broad support. I hope it will pass. 
   The organizational chart contained in the Rudman panel report, which graphically displays the panel's recommendation to create a new separately organized Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, includes the Deputy Secretary in the same box as the Secretary. The amendment before the Senate today, however, is silent with respect to the duties and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary. 
   The absence of any reference to the Deputy Secretary of Energy could be simply an oversight. But given the language in the underlying amendment that prohibits all others in the Department of Energy, except the Secretary, from supervising or directing the new Agency or its staff, I believe the role of the Deputy should be clearly spelled out. 
   Each of the separately organized agencies of the Department of Defense, sited as organizational models by Senators Rudman's panel, relies heavily on the involvement of the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Indeed, the Deputy Secretary of Defense has a full delegation of responsibility from the Secretary of Defense to act for the Secretary. 
   This amendment removes the potential for confusion about the role of the Deputy Secretary of Energy and is consistent with the organizational charts contained in the Rudman panel report that describe the organization of the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendments which we have just adopted improve the underlying provision. Nevertheless, there are some important concerns that were raised, and I want to take a moment to address them and speak to the hope they be addressed in conference. Let me go through some of these concerns. 
   First, section (k) of the amendment prohibits anybody in the Department except for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary from providing supervision or direction to the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   That could prohibit certain specific statutory authorities found in other laws from being implemented. For instance, the Chief Financial Officers Act established some very specific authorities and duties for chief financial officers. They must direct all aspects of a department's fiscal policy. 
   Second, the same is true for the Inspector Generals Act. The inspector general has independent investigatory authority over the entire Department of Energy, including the new Agency. This authority includes the authority to direct and conduct investigations unimpeded. To conduct the investigations, the inspector general has, by law, full access to everyone in the department. 
   Those two important pieces of law, existing legislation, are key tools in avoiding waste, fraud, and abuse. I do not believe that we can nor should nor perhaps even intend in this amendment, this underlying amendment, to modify them. But it is unclear and I hope it will be clarified in conference so we do not impede the operation of those laws by this language. 
   Third, the method of appointing certain employees of the new Agency, in my judgment, violates the appointments clause of the Constitution. For instance, in section 213 (j)(1), the amendment says that ``the Under Secretary shall, with the approval of the Secretary and Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, designate the chief of Counterintelligence. .....'' That responsibility, making an appointment, is, under the appointments clause, restricted to the Secretary or the President of the United States. I do not think we can delegate that authority by statute to this new Agency Director. 
   Fourth, there are certain restrictions on how the head of the new Agency submits reports to Congress, which I believe run afoul of the separation of powers doctrine. 
   Fifth, there are still too many restrictions on the Secretary's authority to control and direct the Agency. 
   Sixth, there are provisions which establish new relationships between the Department of Energy contractors and Federal employees of the Department. Those relationships may violate the current operating contracts for DOE facilities. More important, these new relationships may make these contractor employees Federal employees for certain purposes, such as the Federal Authority Claims Act, the Federal Drivers Act, and the Federal ethics statutes. 
   These are a few of the statutes that could be interpreted as being applicable to contractor employees, raising new issues of liability and responsibilities. I believe the implications of these should be and must be fully understood before we finally adopt a law in this area, a reorganization of this 
   Department, and a conference report which contains any such implications or changes. 
   These issues and others should be addressed in conference on this provision. I wanted to highlight them now for our colleagues. We have made some progress on this underlying amendment, on the amendment which I think reflects the determination of most of us that we do create this semiautonomous agency. That represents, I believe, almost the consensus view of the Senate--pretty close to it--that we have a semiautonomous agency. But there are a lot of subquestions to that issue. Just creating a semiautonomous agency does not resolve the myriad of questions that exist in that process. Some of them have now been resolved. I thank my colleagues for their work with me on that. 
   Senator BINGAMAN has had some very important amendments which have been adopted as well. The Kyl amendment is a better amendment now that those amendments of ours have been added to it. But, again, there are many remaining questions and doubts which, hopefully, the conferees will resolve. I wanted to bring some of those to the attention of our colleague at this time. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nebraska and my friend from New Mexico for their courtesies in sharing the floor so that we can chat about some of the issues which we will be taking up when we move to this bill tomorrow, which I hope and expect we will. 
   One of the issues we are going to be taking up, which will probably take more time than other issues in this bill, is the Department of Energy reorganization issue. This comes to the floor on this bill. Whether it is the best place or not, it is going to happen. I think everyone wants this reorganization issue to be resolved, hopefully, in some kind of a consensus manner, if possible, in a way that it can become law. 
   There is strong opposition in the House to the reorganization of the Department of Energy being added to either the Department of Defense authorization bill or to this appropriations bill, this intelligence appropriation. That is a fact of life we have to deal with. 
   I suggest the more we are able to come together in a bill which has more of a consensus support, the stronger position we are going to be in, in trying to persuade the House to take up this matter promptly, for all the reasons the Senator from New Mexico gave, as well as to get the President to sign the bill. I hope we will take these hours between now and the time this bill is before the Senate to attempt to work out some of the differences that do exist. 
   I simply want to summarize where at least I am in terms of the recommendations of the Rudman commission. I am for those recommendations. The label of the agency is not as important to me as the powers of this new agency--semiautonomous agency, separately organized agencies, as they are called, including DARPA. I believe we should have a separately organized agency which is synonymous with, I presume, a semiautonomous agency. 
   That does not resolve the issue, simply to agree on a label. The question then is: What powers will that agency have and what is the relationship of that new agency to the Department of Energy? That is the issue we should try to resolve in a consensus manner if we possibly can. 
   We want two things to be true: We want this agency to have a significant degree of autonomy, independence, separate organization, separate staff, legal advice, personnel advice. We want them to have their own set of staff so they can operate in a significantly independent way. 
   On the other hand, we want the Secretary to be able to run his agency, to run the overall agency. If it is going to be in the Energy Department, if it is not going to be carved out of the Energy Department--which was the other alternative that Rudman suggested as a possibility--if it is going to be inside the Energy Department, then we have to have the Secretary be able to implement the policies of the Department of Energy, which have to apply to all parts of the Department of Energy, whether or not they are ``separately organized'' agencies within the Department. 
   That is the balance we are trying to strike. I will come to that a little bit later, as to how other separately organized agencies within the Department of Defense have struck that balance. Reaching a consensus, instead of having a significantly divided vote, is going to strengthen the prospects for reorganization of the Department of Energy along the lines Senator Rudman has proposed. 
   Do we need to reorganize the Department? We sure do. For 20 years or longer, there have been reports after reports after reports of lack of accountability, of duplication, of an inability for this Department to function in a very smooth and strong way, particularly as it relates to elements of national security. We should do something about it. We should do it now. It  doesn't mean we should simply say let's delay it for some later time. On that, I think, there is a consensus. We ought to fix this Department, not just say let's do it at a later time. 
   I hope there is also some agreement that we ought to take the few days that may be necessary to try to put together a reorganized DOE--one which has a separately organized agency to handle these nuclear issues--so we can have a stronger chance of this becoming law. We have all been frustrated by the breakdown in security which the Cox commission report highlighted by the so-called PFIAB report, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which Senator Rudman chaired. That frustration has been compounded by the fact that past administrations and past Congresses have received literally dozens of intelligence studies, GAO reports, FBI briefings, going back to the mid-1970s, detailing inadequate security safeguards at the Department of Energy labs and detailing foreign espionage efforts to obtain sensitive U.S. technology. This has been going on for over 20 years. 
   This is what Senator Rudman said at a joint hearing of four Senate committees:  
   I had our staffs sit down and add up the number of reports that have found problems with the security of the DOE for the past 20 years. The numbers are astounding. 29 reports from the General Accounting Office, 61 internal DOE reports and more than a dozen reports from special task forces and ad hoc panels. Altogether, that is more than 100 reports, or an average of five critical reports a year for the past two decades.  
   Here we are, 20 years down the road, Senator Rudman said, still battling with the same issues. I think you would agree with me, that is totally unacceptable. All Members listening that day I think were nodding our heads, without exception. 
   As Senator Rudman noted last month, security at the Department of Energy has been an accident waiting to happen for over 20 years. Three administrations and Congress share the responsibility for not doing more over the years to heed the 
   warnings of those reports to legislate corrective action. The challenge is to put that frustration, which we all share, to constructive use and to put in place an effective and workable management structure, the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program, that ensures our vital national security secrets are not compromised in the future. 
   The Rudman recommendations include not just putting in place a separately organized agency but also putting that agency under the effective direction and control of the Secretary of Energy. That is going to be, it seems to me, what we have to resolve. We want it separately organized, but we want the Secretary to have effective direction and control of that agency. Those are two goals. Those two goals can be harmonized. They have been with other separately organized agencies, including some that I will mention in the Department of Defense which are used by Senator Rudman as his model, including DARPA. 
   We should seek both things: That semiautonomy, or that separate organization, which will put some focus and accountability inside that agency. If we are going to leave it in the Department of Energy--and that seems to be the consensus, that we leave it inside the Department--we must be able to have a Secretary who can effectively direct and control that semiautonomous or separately organized agency within his Department. It is a real challenge, but it is doable. We will do it with some care. They are both legitimate goals. 
   There have been some steps taken already to achieve those goals. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, we had a Presidential Decision Directive No. 61 which President Clinton signed over a year ago. The Rudman report noted, to its credit, in the past 2 years the Clinton administration has proposed and begun to implement some of the most far-reaching reforms in DOE's history. In February of 1998 that directive was signed. The Rudman report highlighted 5 of the most significant of the 13 initiatives in Presidential Directive No. 61. 
   First, counterintelligence and foreign intelligence elements in DOE would be reconfigured into two independent offices and report directly to the Secretary of Energy. 
   Second, the Director of the new Office of Counterintelligence would be a senior executive from the FBI and would have direct access to the Secretary of Energy. That is a very important question we are going to have to resolve and take up again, 
   whether or not we want the director of a new Office of Counterintelligence to be not only a senior executive from the FBI but to have direct access to the Secretary of Energy. If we want to hold the Secretary of Energy accountable, which I do, then we have to access to him directly, it seems to me, a director of a new Office of Counterintelligence. That will be one of the issues we will be discussing and hopefully resolve. 
   Third, existing DOE contracts with the labs would be amended to include counterintelligence program goals, objectives, and performance measures to evaluate compliance with these contractual obligations. 
   Counterintelligence personnel assigned to the labs would have direct access to lab directors and would report concurrently to the Director of the Office of Counterintelligence. 
   The Senate has also acted in a number of ways. We passed significant legislation this year under the leadership of Chairman WARNER in the Armed Services Committee. We have adopted a series of measures in the National Defense Authorization Act which were designed to enhance counterintelligence, security, and intelligence activities at DOE facilities. 
   These measures include putting in statute most of the specific recommendations on security and counterintelligence contained in PDD-61. For instance, our bill, which is now in conference, includes a provision establishing separate offices of counterintelligence and security at DOE, each reporting to the Secretary. That provision, which the Senate already adopted, is in the DOD authorization conference, which is going on right now. It is taking up a Senate provision which establishes an office of counterintelligence and security at the DOE reporting directly to the Secretary. 
   That is not inconsistent, in my book, with having a counterintelligence chief at the agency. I do not view that as being inconsistent. On the other hand, we have to be clear one way or the other as to whether or not we believe there is an inconsistency in having both a counterintelligence person for the entire agency directly reporting to the Secretary, as well as having this new agency having its own counterintelligence chief. To me, that is not inconsistent, but the people who are offering the amendment may view that as being an inconsistency.

   Mr. LEVIN. That is somewhat different than the provision in the Senate bill which established the separate Office of Counterintelligence and Security at the DOE reporting directly to the Secretary. We have to work out whether we intend that to be the same or whether we intend that to be two separate offices of counterintelligence. 
   For instance, the new agency, I say to my good friend, is going to presumably have its own personnel director and its own programs inspector general and its own general counsel, but so is the Department of Energy going to have its own general counsel and its own personnel director and its own inspector 
   general. There will be an office in that separate agency, and there will be an office at the Department. That is not inherently inconsistent. We do similar things with DARPA and with other separately organized agencies. 
   It seems to me, to make sure that we are not creating confusion and lack of accountability, we would want to make that clear in the amendment that we, indeed, are talking about an office at the departmental level, as well as now a separate office with some of these staff functions at this separately organized agency. 
   Again, that is the kind of language which I think is important we attempt to work out.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico. Senator Rudman has said the following, in addition to the quotation my colleague cited:  
   That the Secretary is still responsible for developing and promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters.  
   Then he said, and this is in his memorandum of clarification dated June 30, the second paragraph from the bottom:  
   He is still responsible----  
   Talking about the Secretary----  
   for promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters, and it makes sense to us that a Secretary would want advisers on his or her immediate staff to assist in this vein. We understand that is why Secretary Richardson recently created DOE-wide czars to advise him on security and counterintelligence.  
   There is a need for a Secretary who is running a Department to have, as Senator Rudman points out, advisers on his or her immediate staff to assist him in developing and promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters. 
   I want to take up the suggestion of my friend from New Mexico. It is possible we can achieve both, as the DOD does with DARPA and other separately organized agencies, or what I think the Senator from New Mexico would indicate are semi-autonomous agencies, agencies which are not separate from a Cabinet-level agency; they are not separate from the Department. We are not creating a new department, and I do not think the Senator from New Mexico wants to create a new department. We want this inside a department which is subject to departmental-wide policies and a Secretary who is able to effectuate those policies.

   Mr. LEVIN. As I understand what you are saying, you want one Secretary to be able to have effective direction and control of this quasi-autonomous agency that is in his Department. With that standard, if that is a standard which you also accept, it seems to me that we ought to be able to find common ground. Whether that includes all the other Senators who have interests in this, neither of us can say. But as far as I am concerned, the test for me is whether or not we leave the Secretary of Energy like the Secretary of Defense with DARPA, having effective direction and control of that separately organized agency which has been called here a semiautonomous agency. That is my standard. 
   I am going to continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle; and our staffs will share some amendment language which at least this Senator is working on. There are other Senators who have amendments as well. We will get you our amendment language by the end of the day in the spirit of trying to achieve some kind of a joint position on this going into the debate tomorrow. 
   I am happy to yield the floor. I heard my friend from New Mexico indicate that he is only able to stay a few more minutes. I am basically done. There are a few more thoughts I have about some of the separately organized agencies inside the Department of Defense and the way they are organized. They were used as the models by Senator Rudman. If we follow those models, I think--not exactly and not precisely--but if we follow the spirit of those models, we will have a Secretary of Energy who can effectively direct and control his semiautonomous agency that would be created, including, it seems to me, to be effective, the use, as Senator Rudman pointed out, of advisers on his immediate staff to assist him in effectively directing and controlling--which are my last words, not Senator Rudman's. 
   I yield the floor and thank my friend from New Mexico.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we've all heard the saying, ``if at first you don't succeed, try, try, again.'' It's a lesson we've been taught since childhood. It's a lesson used to teach children to be persistent and work hard if they want to achieve their goals. It is also a lesson that applies to the purchase of firearms, and it is one that Benjamin Smith knew all too well. 
   Over the Fourth of July weekend, the majority of Americans were celebrating the birth of our nation. But the long holiday weekend produced yet another tragedy, made possible by the free flow of deadly firearms. A single man, Benjamin Smith, with a hatred for life, allegedly used a .22 caliber handgun and a .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun to murder two people and wound nine before ending his own life. 
   The alleged gunman had a history of violence, a protection order filed against him, and belonged to an organization that espouses hatred toward minorities, yet, he was still able to purchase deadly firearms, all because he was persistent. Approximately one week before his killing spree, he had applied to purchase firearms from a licensed firearms dealer in Illinois. He obtained an owner identification card, filled out an application, and expected to retrieve his weapons shortly thereafter. A few days later, however, he returned to buy the weapons and was rejected by the licensed dealer after failing to pass the Illinois state background check. Unfortunately, Benjamin Smith knew his lesson, ``if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.'' 
   Benjamin Smith knew of other means to obtain firearms. He knew that although he was not permitted to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, he would have few problems buying a gun on the street, from an unlicensed dealer. He knew that federal law requires that background checks be conducted by licensed dealers, but he also knew of a large secondary market in the United States that permits the free flow of weapons in to the hands of those who can not pass background checks. And, because he knew how easy it is to obtain a gun in the United States, Benjamin Smith was able to try, again, to purchase firearms for his killing spree. 
   Smith's second attempt to purchase guns was successful and as a result, this dangerous young man was equipped with the two handguns believed to be used in the several Independence Day shootings. Because of this secondary market that allows easy accessibility of firearms, the nation is  again mourning the loss of innocent lives lost to gunfire. And although the American public expresses continual outrage that federal firearms laws are not strong enough to prevent persons like Benjamin Smith from purchasing guns, Congress has not yet responded. We need to try, try again to pass meaningful legislation that will put an end to this senseless slaughter.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Patients' Bill of Rights which Democrats have offered and fought for during these four days of consideration and which the Republican majority has weakened at every turn. I cannot support the inadequate substitute which Republicans have now put before us. The Republican bill is full of loopholes in the fundamental protections for patients which we seek to provide. In fact, the substitute Republican bill provides almost no protections for nearly two-thirds of Americans with health insurance. 
   The Democratic bill would guarantee access to needed specialists. The Republican bill fails to guarantee patients access to needed specialists outside the HMO at no extra charge. The Democratic bill would assure access to the closest emergency room. The Republican does not guarantee access without financial penalty and prior authorization. The Democratic bill gives women the right to choose their OB/GYN as their primary doctor, as many women wish to do and protects women from ``drive-through mastectomies''. The Republican version is not adequate. And unlike the Democratic bill, the Republicans fail to hold HMOs accountable when their decisions and practices lead to the death or injury of patients. And, the Republicans would continue to allow insurance company officials to override the medical decisions of a patient's own doctors. 
   Mr. President, in short, the Republican substitute for the Democratic bill is a mere shadow which does not deserve the title, ``Patients' Bill of Rights''. 
   The core of the Democratic effort has been to ensure that insurance administrators not overrule a health care professional's medical decisions, that HMOs can be held accountable for their actions which is a responsibility every other industry has to its consumers, and to ensure that all insured are protected. The Republicans have developed a bill that leaves more than 113 million Americans with insurance unprotected because most of the provisions in their bill for the most part are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance, self-funded employer plans, which cover only 48 million of the 161 million people with private insurance. 
   Our bill ensures that the special needs of children are met, including access to pediatric specialists. It provides important protections specific to women in managed care such as direct access to ob/gyn care and services and the ability to designate an ob/gyn as a primary care provider, and provides specific protections regarding hospital length-of-stay for mastectomy, by allowing the physician and patient to make decisions the length of stay in a hospital following a mastectomy or lumpectomy. The Republican bill does not prevent ``drive-through mastectomies.'' Additionally, our bill speaks to the issue of specialty care. Patients with special health conditions must have access to providers who have the expertise to treat their problems. Our amendment allows for referrals for enrollees to go out of the plan's network for specialty care, at no extra cost to the enrollee, if there is no appropriate provider available in the network. There are about 30 million Americans who have had trouble seeing specialists with their HMO plans. This includes women and children with special needs who either had critical care delayed or, worse, had that care denied. On the issue of emergency services, the Democratic amendment says that individuals must have access to emergency care, without prior authorization, in any situation that a ``prudent lay person'' would regard as an emergency.  
   Survey after survey reveals that the American people support these proposed protections. And, there are over 200 patient groups and health care provider organizations, workers' unions, and employee groups, that stand behind the need for these patient protections. That list includes the American Medical Association, American Heart Association, American Nurses Association, American Public Health Associations, Center for Women Policy Studies and the Child Welfare League of America. We have a stark choice before us, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that protects patients or a weak bill aimed at protecting insurance companies. 
   Earlier this week, Mr. Steve Geeter, husband and father of two young children of Grass Lake, Michigan, stopped by to visit with my office. Mr. Geeter has terminal brain cancer and will be participating in an experimental clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health over the next several months. Mr. Geeter and his wife spent a considerable amount of time with my staff discussing his options and limitations under his HMO plan and the need for reforms, including access to clinical trials. I very much appreciate Mr. Geeter taking the time to share his HMO experiences with my office. They substantiate the need for the legislation before us. Several months ago, Mr. Geeter's HMO plan required that he be released from the hospital after 24 hours of intensive care following brain surgery. The plan's justification was that Mr. Geeter had passed the neurological exams and transfer to a room would cost too much. Mr. Geeter subsequently developed complications and had to be returned to the hospital emergency room. This may have been averted with just an additional 1-day hospital stay-over. The Democratic amendment would have protected patients, such as Mr. Geeter, from an insurance company official requiring that they be discharged from the hospital prematurely. Plans would no longer be able to deny promised benefits based on an interpretation of medical necessity defined by insurance companies rather than the patient's health care provider. The Democratic amendment used a professional standard of medical necessity--based on case law and standards historically used by insurance companies. 
   Mr. Geeter also expressed strong support for the Democratic amendment on access to clinical trials of experimental treatments, which offer patients access to cutting-edge technology and are the primary means of testing new therapies for deadly diseases. Historically, insurance plans have paid the patient care costs for clinical trials, not the costs of the experimental therapy itself. However, research institutions, particularly cancer centers, increasingly are finding that trials, which once were paid for by health insurance, must be curtailed because of lack of payment by managed care plans. Clinical trials may be the only treatment option available for patients who, like Mr. Geeter, have failed to respond to conventional therapies. Under the amendment, trials are limited to those approved and funded the National institutes of Health {NIH}; a cooperative group or center of the NIH; or, certain trials through the Department of Defense or the Veterans Administration. The Republican bill provides no hope for patients with no options other than a promising experimental treatment down the road. A study is not enough for a patient with a life-threatening disease when there are no other treatment options and there is nowhere else to turn. 
   In addition to having the benefit of the input of Mr. Geeter, I've communicated with others in my state. Over the past several months, I have traveled around Michigan and met with constituents various communities to get their thoughts on our efforts here in the Senate. I have had discussions with physicians, hospital administrators, nurses, seniors, city and county 
   government representatives and health care advocates. 
   Ms. Myrna Holland, a resident of Ferndale, Michigan and Director of Nursing Education at Providence Hospital expressed concern that patient choice is limited when HMOs engage in restrictive practices such as ``doctor-only'' policies. These professionals include, but are not limited to, certified nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners physical therapists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors. This is particularly important for patients living in rural areas. Many rural communities have a difficult time recruiting physicians, and often non-physician providers are the only source of health care in the local area. If a managed care plan covers a particular service, but there is no one in the community to provide it, rural patients are too often forced to drive long distances, incurring expense, to get the care they need. The Democratic amendment would have prohibited HMOs from arbitrarily refusing to allow health care professionals to participate in their plans by virtue of their licensure or certification. The Republican bill would allow HMOs to continue restrictive practices, leaving consumers with an inadequate choice of health care providers or limited access to health care. 
   Robert Casalou, Acting Administration of Providence Hospital in Michigan, raised concerns about continuity of care. The Democratic amendment assured continuity of care. When health plans terminate providers without cause or when employers switch health plans for their employees, quality of care for patients currently undergoing treatment can be severely threatened.. For example, a patient who is undergoing a course of chemotherapy should not have to change physicians abruptly in the middle of treatment, and a woman who is pregnant should not have to change doctors before she gives birth. The Democratic amendment allowed for a transition to lessen those problems. When a doctor no longer is included as a provider under a plan, or an employee changes plans, our amendment provided for at least 90 days of transitional care for any patients undergoing an active course of treatment with that doctor. The amendment also provided special protections for pregnancy, terminal illness, and institutionalization. 
   Additionally, Mr. Casalou, and others, expressed support for holding HMOs accountable for their actions. Today, 123 million Americans who receive insurance coverage through a private employer cannot seek redress for injuries caused by their insurer. All they can claim is the cost of the benefit denied or delayed. Even if an HMO has been directly involved in dictating, denying or delaying care for a patient, it can use a loophole in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. ERISA was designed to protect employees from losing pension benefits due to fraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies during the 1960s, but the law has had the effect of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care with no effective remedy for patients. The Democratic amendment would have closed this loophole, ensuring that HMOs can be held accountable for their actions. It did not establish a right to sue. It simply says Federal law will no longer block what the States deem to be appropriate remedies for patients and families who are harmed. The only time an employer can be held responsible is when the employer is involved directly in a specific case and makes a decision that leads to injury or death. 
   Donald Anderson, who I spoke with in Detroit, is a quadriplegic who is in a wheelchair who changed jobs and also changed health care providers. Donald's new provider would not cover a rolling commode wheelchair for him after the wheel broke on the wheelchair he owned, even though his doctor classified the chair as a medical necessity. Our amendment would have allowed the physician, not the insurance company, to decide what prescriptions and equipment are medically necessary. The amendment provided that a plan may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or particular services if the services are medically necessary. Under the Democratic amendment, Donald would have received a rolling commode. 
   In Grand Rapids, I spoke with another constituent of mine, Dr. Willard Stawski, a general surgeon. Dr. Stawski told me about a patient of his who did not seek care for her hernia because she was told by her HMO that it was an unnecessary operation. Dr. Stawski told me that after his patient elected not to have the operation, she became very ill. Gangrene set in and she died several months later. Under  the Democratic amendment, this tragedy might have been averted. What a doctor deems to be medically necessary, is the medical treatment that the patient receives. Thus, Dr. Stawski's patient would have had the surgery because Dr. Stawski said that the surgery was medically necessary. 
   All we were asking for with this amendment is that patients be able to receive the care that a doctor or other medical professionals deems to be medically necessary. Doctors are frustrated, patients are frustrated. The Republican majority defeated our efforts to adopt these good amendments. 
   Mr. President, while I cannot support the Republican susbstiutute bill, I hope we will have a later opportunity to pass a strong bill of rights. The public wants a strong one and they are right.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on June 10th we held a hearing on home health care in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Subcommittee where we examined how the so called ``reforms'' of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 were holding up. I continue to believe that the answer to that question is, ``not well.'' That is why I am joining with my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, the Chairman of the PSI Subcommittee, in introducing an important bill, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1999. 
   Home health care agencies provide a vital service to many elderly Americans. In my own state of Michigan there are over 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries. Over 100,000 of these beneficiaries use the services of Michigan's 223 home health agencies. People prefer to recuperate in their own homes, and it is also less costly for the government since the alternative is nursing home care which is extraordinarily expensive for the Medicare program. 
   I am concerned about potential access problems. Although HCFA and the GAO have reported that they have not seen a decline in access for beneficiaries, the home health care witnesses that spoke before the PSI Subcommittee all stated that they believed there was an access problem. In fact, Barbara Markham Smith, from the George Washington University Medical Center, testified that ``many seriously ill patients, especially diabetics, appear to have been displaced from Medicare home care.'' Sometimes it takes a while for the people in the field to actually get the numbers back to the people in Washington, and I think this is one of those instances. 
   We all know that during the early 90's home health care expenditures grew at a rapid pace. According to the GAO, Medicare spent $3.7 billion to pay for home health visits in 1990 compared to $17.8 billion in 1997. This growth led to changes, like the interim payment system, (IPS) that were implemented  under the Balanced Budget Act. While some of the changes under the Balanced Budget Act were good, some of the changes are now negatively impacting Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I have heard from many constituents regarding home health care changes under the Balanced Budget Act and the various regulations that HCFA has imposed. In fact, last year, I received some 1500 letters from both home health care providers and beneficiaries. I echo their concerns when I say that the interim payment system penalizes cost efficient home health providers, like those in Michigan, while rewarding higher cost agencies. 
   Not only does the IPS penalize agencies that attempted to keep their costs down in 1994, but the new regulations which HCFA has imposed on the agencies are quite burdensome. There is no more poignant story to demonstrate the undue burdens being placed on home health care providers than that of Linda Stock, a Michigan home health care provider. This month Ms. Stock testified before the PSI Subcommittee about the problems that home care providers were having, particularly cost efficient home care providers like her own. Last week Ms. Stock called to let me know that she has resigned from her job because she did not feel that she could ask her staff to implement regulations such as OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set) and the 15 minute increment home health reporting requirement. It is tragic that a committed health care provider such as Linda Stock would feel the need to resign from her job rather than 
   implement regulations which she believed were unfair to both beneficiaries and providers. 
   So what can be done in the face of these problems? I believe that the bill we are introducing today, if enacted, could go a long way towards helping Ms. Stock and others like her. 
   Last year I worked on a bill with Senator COLLINS to revise the payment formula used to calculate the per beneficiary limit. That bill would have created new winners and losers under the IPS. This year's bill does not attempt to revise the formula, and therefore avoids the formula fight which made action on this issue so difficult last year. Our new bill makes needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and related federal regulations. 
   Though technical in nature, I would like to read the major provisions found in the bill:

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1972, Congress established the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an independent regulatory agency designed to ``protect the public from unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.'' Since 1972, CPSC has worked to accomplish that goal by developing uniform safety standards, obtaining the recall of dangerous products, and researching, informing and educating consumers about product related hazards. CPSC has jurisdiction over thousands categories of products, from furniture to sporting equipment, appliances, clothing and toys. 
   Although almost all categories of consumer products are reviewed for safety, there are millions of dangerous products in the United States that go untested. These products, which are among the leading cause of death in the United States, are exempted from oversight by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They are not subject to any quality and safety standards, nor are their manufacturers required to provide warnings to consumers about their hazards. These products are firearms, and despite the fact that they kill some 35,000 people each year, they are exempt from oversight by the federal agency that provides Americans with lifesaving information. 
   The fact that guns are one of the only categories of products not subject to regulation is another example of a loophole in our federal firearms law. In the 1968 Gun Control Act, Congress set quality and safety standards for imported guns, yet failed to impose such criteria on domestically manufactured weapons. As a result, many of the guns manufactured today lack even the most basic kind of safety devices. 
   Gun manufacturers have the ability to include basic safety mechanisms in their firearms that would substantially reduce firearm related deaths. Yet most gun manufacturers have refused to implement even the most basic technology in their products. It would surprise most Americans to know that firearms manufactured in the United States are not required to pass a ``drop test,'' a series of tests and measurements to ensure that guns will not accidentally fire if dropped. Nor are they required to include simple features on firearms, such as load indicators which tell the user the gun is loaded. Many firearms also lack a magazine disconnect safety, a small safety improvement that costs approximately 50 cents, and could save the lives of hundreds of children who die from unintentional shootings. In addition, there are no requirements that firearms are manufactured with internal locking devices or combination locks. These are simple solutions for safety, but until guns are regulated as a consumer product, they are unlikely to be implemented by domestic manufacturers. 
   Manufacturers should also pursue technology to develop ``smart'' or ``personalized'' guns. Although there is no such working weapon that uses this technology now, there are plans by some manufacturers to explore the development of smart guns that recognize their owners through fingerprints, radio emissions or skin conductivity. The NRA and other gun manufacturers, such as Berretta U.S.A. Corp, are opposed to the development of smart gun technology, because they believe it would lead to mandatory safety standards. Yet, personalization concepts that allow only the authorized user access to his firearm, are sure to decrease the number of fatal unintentional injuries, homicides and suicides. 
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is capable of monitoring firearms, just as they review baby cribs, hair dryers, basketballs, even toy guns, and the thousands of other products manufactured in the United States. But until Congress amends the Consumer Product Safety Act and revokes this special privilege given to firearms manufacturers, guns manufactured in the United States are unlikely to include even basic safety mechanisms.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a physician from my home state of Michigan, Dr. Eugene Oliveri, who will be named the new President of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) at the Association's annual meeting in July. 
   Dr. Oliveri practices at two outstanding medical facilities in Metropolitan Detroit. He is a senior member of the Department of Internal Medicine at Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan, where he also serves as Chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology and as Director of the Gastroenterology Fellowship Program. Dr. Oliveri is also affiliated with Huron Valley Hospital in Milford, Michigan. 
   Dr. Oliveri has established himself as a national leader in the osteopathic profession. He serves on a number of professional boards, is sought after as a visiting lecturer, and is committed to training and inspiring the next generation of osteopathic physicians. In fact, there are two osteopaths in the Oliveri family, and I know it is a point of pride for Dr. Eugene Oliveri that his daughter, Lisa, chose to pursue the profession to which he has dedicated so much of his life. 
   The state of Michigan is a leader in the practice of osteopathy. One hundred and two years ago, Michigan was the fourth state in the nation to legalize the practice of osteopathy. Today's osteopathic physicians and surgeons integrate standard medical practices with the body's natural systems for regulating and healing itself, especially with the largest of these systems, the musculoskeletal system. Dr. Oliveri follows in the tradition of the thousands of skilled and dedicated osteopathic doctors who have practiced medicine in Michigan for more than a century. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Eugene Oliveri has distinguished himself as a physician, as a teacher and as a leader of his profession. It is fitting that Dr. Oliveri, who  practices medicine in a state which has such a longstanding commitment to osteopathic medicine, will be elected President of the American Osteopathic Association. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Oliveri on his achievements and in wishing him well during his tenure as President of the AOA.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the McConnell amendment striking the provision in the Brownback amendment, also called the Silk Road Act, which would grant the President authority to waive Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 is an important provision of our law which prohibits U.S. Government assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan until it takes ``demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh.'' For the last 10 years, the Government of Azerbaijan has resisted taking such simple steps and instead has maintained its blockade of the transportation of food, medicine, fuel and other important items to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. The Azeri blockade has led to great human suffering while seriously hampering economic development of the region. I cannot support the Silk Road Act as offered because by allowing for the waiver of Section 907 we would be removing one of the last remaining incentives we have to induce the Azeris to enter into good faith negotiations over this conflict. I believe that we all have similar goals for the region which include: economic development and cooperation; fostering of democratic principles; and the adherence to universally recognized human rights standards. Allowing for the waiver of Section 907 runs counter to these important goals by rewarding a nation which has blockaded its neighbors, maintained an authoritarian government that took power in a nondemocratic fashion, and has a human rights record that has been recognized by the U.S. State Department as ``poor.'' I urge my colleagues to support the continuation of Section 907.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the foreign operations appropriations bill being considered by the Senate. There is one area of this bill that I believe deserves particular attention, and that is the series of provisions relating to U.S. funding for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO. This is the organization that is implementing certain provisions of the U.S.-North Korean nuclear Agreed Framework of 1994. U.S. funds for KEDO pay for the heavy fuel oil that the U.S. is committed to provide to North Korea in exchange for its agreement to freeze and eventually dismantle its plutonium production program that could be used for nuclear weapons. 
   Mr. President, that Agreed Framework is working in our national security interests now. Under that agreement, North Korea has frozen its plutonium production facilities and canned almost all of the spent nuclear reactor fuel from its graphite-moderated reactor in Yongbyon, all under the watchful eye of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) personnel and monitoring instruments. 
   As recent Secretaries of Defense and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  have repeatedly and consistently testified to Congress, it is clearly in our security interest that North Korea not produced any more plutonium and that its spend reactor fuel be canned and removed from North Korea. In addition, it is important for North Korea to account for all its past plutonium production to the satisfaction of the IAEA. If, and only if, North Korea satisfies all those requirements of the Agreed Framework, then KEDO, will provide two lightwater nuclear power production reactors to North Korea, with South Korea and Japan paying the overwhelming majority of the cost of those reactors.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, and I commend him and Senators COLLINS and LIEBERMAN for their effort in putting together a bill which we believe represents lessons learned but also represents the feeling that we need to have an independent counsel law, that sooner or later it will again appear that this country needs a way in which to independently investigate allegations of serious wrongdoing against high-level officials. 
   The independent counsel law expires tomorrow. It was enacted in 1978 to establish a nonpartisan process for investigating allegations of criminal conduct by top executive branch officials. The key purpose of the law is to retain public confidence in criminal investigations when the Government investigates its highest officials. The goal is to treat top Federal officials no better and equally important, no worse than a private citizen, and at the end of the investigation, when the judgment is rendered, be it a statement of guilt or innocence, to have the public accept that judgment as a fair and impartial one. 
   Over the years, there have been many successful investigations by independent counsels, most of which resulted in no indictments or prosecutions but resolved outstanding allegations without partisanship or favor. 
   There have been 20 independent counsel investigations in 20 years. Ten of those were closed without indictment; one was closed because of the death of the covered person. Excluding the top five most expensive investigations, the average cost of an independent counsel investigation was under $1 million. And for all but a handful of the cases investigated by independent counsel, the results of the investigations have had the public's confidence. 
   While some say the lesson of Watergate was that the previous system worked, I would refer our colleagues to the testimony of Henry Ruth, who was in charge of the Watergate special prosecution force during the Saturday Night Massacre. Referring to the possibility that the coverup by President Nixon could succeed, Mr. Ruth said, ``It is impossible to describe how thin a thread existed at that time.'' 
   But the independent counsel law, while working most of the time, has also been abused by a few overzealous prosecutors. These prosecutors have made it apparent that before we reauthorize an independent counsel law, it would need to be dramatically revised to prevent a recurrence of the abuses that we have seen. The bill we are introducing today represents the lessons learned, while saving the essential elements of the independent counsel law to preserve public confidence in the prosecution of our top Government officials. 
   Our bill would, among other things, change the law in the following ways. 
   First, it would preclude an independent counsel from broadening an investigation to matters not within the original grant of jurisdiction. 
   Second, it would enforce the requirement that independent counsel follow the established policies of the Department of Justice by giving affected persons the opportunity to challenge questionable independent counsel actions not in line with those policies. 
   Third, it would eliminate the requirement for an independent counsel to submit an impeachment report to the House of Representatives. 
   Fourth, it would prohibit persons with an apparent or real conflict of interest from serving as independent counsel. 
   And, fifth, it would establish a presumptive 2-year term for an independent counsel's investigation. 
   Those are just five of the many major changes that would be made in the independent counsel law. 
   A handful of independent counsels have exceeded the intent of the independent counsel law and have taken the law to places that U.S. Attorneys would not go when investigating private citizens. 
   Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz took 4 years and spent $20 million investigating allegations of graft in the Agriculture Department. Yet his 2-month trial of former Secretary Mike Espy ended in an acquittal on all 30 counts of corruption. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court threw out Smaltz' conviction of Sun-Diamond Growers of California, concluding that  Smaltz and a Federal district court had stretched the law to punish behavior that is not a crime. 
   The independent counsel for Samuel Pierce, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Reagan, was in existence for almost 10 years, and that included almost 4 years after the independent counsel publicly announced he had closed the case with respect to Mr. Pierce. 
   Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr has singlehandedly done more to undermine public confidence in the independent counsel law than anybody else. Well over half the American people think that Kenneth Starr is partisan and do not trust him to be fair. The editorials expressing concern about Mr. Starr's investigation and judgment are voluminous.

   Mr. LEVIN. A few of the headlines read: ``A Prosecutor Without Public Trust,'' ``Ken Starr's Misjudgments,'' and ``Starr Steps Out of Bounds.'' Robert Morgenthau, in fact, the District Attorney for Manhattan, and one of the most respected prosecutors in the country, is quoted as saying that Mr. Starr violated ``every rule in the book.'' 
   Some argue that the statute should be scrapped. I cannot agree, provided that we can prevent the abuses we have experienced in the past. We need a mechanism to address credible allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing by top executive branch officials. We have made improvements in the statute each of the three times it has been reauthorized over the past 20 years. We have required independent counsel to comply with established Justice Department policies and procedures; we have added standards of conduct for independent counsel; and we have added a whole new host of cost controls, including requiring new independent counsel to comply with the expenditure policies of the Justice Department with respect to salary levels, use of Government office space and travel. 
   But we obviously have failed to foreclose opportunities for major excesses and clear abuses by independent counsel. Unless we can amend the law sufficiently to stop the excesses and abuses in the future--and I think we can do that--then the law should lapse. We need a law but only if the law ensures that individuals who conduct these investigations are highly qualified, nonpartisan attorneys with good judgment and common sense who are bound in by appropriate limits. 
   The list of lessons learned over the last few years is long. We have tried to incorporate them into the bill we are introducing today. 
   The first issues concern the appointment of the independent counsel. There was a high degree of dissatisfaction and concern with the choice of Kenneth Starr as independent counsel in the Whitewater matter. The investigation was already well underway with Special Counsel Bob Fiske who had been appointed by Attorney General Reno. Mr. Fiske was a well-respected, veteran prosecutor who had also been a lifelong Republican. To remove any doubt about whether he could be appointed under the reauthorized independent counsel law as well, Congress had specifically authorized the special division of the court to reappoint him. But the three judge special division took it upon itself to terminate Mr. Fiske and replace him with Mr. Starr. Many of us challenged the court's decision at the time, arguing that Mr. Starr was a highly partisan person who could not bring the necessary appearance of independence to the job. At the time of his appointment he was linked to the Paula Jones case, having argued publicly against the President's position on immunity from civil suit. It turns out he had also conferred numerous times with attorneys for Paula Jones. He had served as the Finance Co-Chairman of the Congressional campaign of a Republican in Alexandria, Virginia. At the time of Mr. Starr's appointment I wrote to the Special Division and urged them to reconsider their decision. ``The issue with respect to Mr. Starr,'' I said, ``..... is that he lacks the necessary appearance of independence essential for public confidence in the process.'' Our concerns have proven to be true over time, to the point that Mr. Starr is perceived by the public as a partisan prosecutor. 
   Our bill would make some very important changes in the current process in this regard. First, the special division of three judges who make independent counsel appointments under current law are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the court picks an independent counsel from a list of candidates developed by the special division from various recommendations over time. Our bill would require that the judges who serve on the special division court be picked by lottery from a pool of all of the federal appellate court judges. The Special Division would then be required to develop a list of qualified candidates to serve as independent counsels from a list of five candidates from each federal circuit selected by the chief judge of each circuit. Our bill would explicitly prohibit an independent counsel candidate from having an actual or apparent conflict of interest, and it would encourage the appointment of an individual with prosecutorial experience. 
   Mr. Starr was not a prosecutor. In making a number of critically important judgment calls, Mr. Starr demonstrated a lack of understanding of the discipline a prosecutor needs in order to exercise the tremendous discretion and power of the office with fairness and justice. The bill would seek to remedy this by requiring the individual appointed as independent counsel to have prosecutorial experience ``to the extent practicable.'' 
   Many people expressed concern over the large and lucrative private practice Mr. Starr continued to have as independent counsel. We will never know if the investigation into the President could have been concluded much more expeditiously had Mr. Starr set aside his private practice from the inception of his appointment, but it's a reasonable possibility at least that it could have been. Independent counsel appointments are supposed to receive the highest priority and the public benefits from a timely resolution of the allegations. Our bill would require an independent counsel to devote full time to the investigation to bring it to a prompt conclusion, because we think doing so has important benefits to the public interest. 
   Another area has to do with the scope of jurisdiction. This has been an area of great concern to some of us. That relates particularly to Mr. Starr's investigation, because he was originally appointed to investigate the Madison Guarantee Savings and Loan matter as it possibly related to President Clinton. But he ended up prosecuting a multitude of other matters. At one point his office even interviewed Arkansas State troopers about President Clinton's relationship with a number of different women when he was Governor. Moreover, Mr. Starr had his jurisdiction expanded to include Travelgate, Filegate, and the Monica Lewinsky matter. With each expansion, he looked more and more like a prosecutor pursuing a person instead of a prosecutor pursuing a crime. 
   In the end he became Javert to President Clinton's Jean Valjean. Our bill limits the scope of the original grant of jurisdiction to only those matters that are ``directly'' related to an independent counsel's original jurisdiction, and eliminates the provision allowing an expansion of jurisdiction. Such matters would be investigated by the Department of Justice or, if appropriate,  a new independent counsel could be appointed. Only in this way can we prevent an independent counsel from becoming a permanent prosecutor of the President or any other covered official. 
   Experience has also taught us that some of these independent counsel investigations develop huge staffs over time--far beyond those that would be available in an ordinary investigation. At one point, it was alleged that the Starr investigation was one of the top three investigations in terms of numbers of FBI agents in the country--ranking right up there with the Unibomber and the World Trade Center bombing. Our bill would limit the number of detailees from the FBI and the Department of Justice to a number reasonably related to the number of staff the Justice Department or FBI normally assigns to a similar case. 
   One of my greatest concerns in the past five years has been the failure of Mr. Starr to comply with both the spirit and, I believe, the letter of the law with respect to the requirement that an independent counsel follow established Department of Justice policies. I have made several floor statements identifying the particular instances in which I believe Mr. Starr has exceeded Justice Department policies, so I will not elaborate here. The current law requires an independent counsel to follow established Justice Department policies except to the extent to do so would undermine the purposes of the independent counsel law. That exception, which was intended to be a very narrow exception, has been used by Mr. Starr to justify a laundry list of questionable actions. The bill we are introducing today would eliminate that exception and provide that the only policy an independent counsel would be allowed to ignore would be that part of a policy or guideline that requires approval by a top Justice Department official. The bill 
   provides that even in that situation, the independent counsel should consult with a top Justice Department official; he or she just isn't required to get that official's approval. 
   The bill also creates a remedy for the situation where a target or witness in an independent counsel investigation believes the independent counsel is not complying with established Justice Department procedures. Currently, Justice Department policies are not enforceable in court, and several individuals who attempted to enforce compliance by Mr. Starr were turned away by the court. This bill would give such an individual an explicit right to first obtain an opinion by the Attorney General as to whether an independent counsel was complying with a specific Department of Justice policy, and if the Attorney General determines that the independent counsel is not, the bill allows the person to seek enforcement from the special court. 
   Mr. Starr took the unusual step in his investigation to hire an outside ethics attorney. The bill requires an independent counsel to use as his or her ethics adviser the person already housed in the Department of Justice who is familiar with the ethical rules and regulations of a Justice Department Attorney--the designated agency ethics official or DAEO. This will help to keep the office of the independent counsel in tune with the ethical requirements of other investigative offices, giving greater assurance that Justice Department policies with respect to ethics issues will be followed. 
   Great concern has developed over the cost of these independent counsel investigations. Mr. Smaltz spent some $20 million to have a 30 count indictment rejected by a jury. Mr. Starr is likely to be the most expensive independent counsel ever--topping $50 million when all is said and done. These figures are shocking. The bill would address this problem by requiring an independent counsel to establish a budget with consultation of the Attorney General and the General Accounting Office to review the budget and submit a written analysis to Congress. We have tried with every reauthorization of this statute to obtain cost controls over the operations of the independent counsels. We've made some progress, but obviously more needs to be done. The bill also sets a two year presumptive limit on the work of an independent counsel and requires the independent counsel to affirmatively seek an extension for one year from the special court. By requiring an independent counsel to establish a budget and presumptively limiting the term of an independent counsel to two years, I believe we will impose a useful and meaningful cost control on these offices. 
   A final concern that many of us have had with the independent counsel law is the provision regarding the referral of information to the House of Representatives regarding possible impeachable offenses. Mr. Starr's report to the House was not only shockingly and unnecessarily graphic, it was a brief for impeachment, far beyond the role envisioned by the independent counsel law. Mr. Starr's report also violated the fairness expected by the American people by presenting information on possible impeachable offenses in a biased and prejudicial manner. Under the Constitution, the House has sole responsibility to decide whether or not the President should be impeached. The independent counsel did not have a statutory responsibility to argue for impeachment. His responsibility was to forward ``information'' to the Congress that ``may constitute grounds for an impeachment.'' Our bill would eliminate the provision with respect to impeachment, removing any obligation on the part of an independent counsel to take any initiative in this which is reserved exclusively to the House of Representatives by the Constitution. 
   Finally, it is clear, obviously, that the independent counsel law is going to expire tomorrow. We are going to have the cooling off period that former Senator Howard Baker prescribed during our Governmental Affairs Committee hearings. I hope that after a reasonable cooling off period we will turn our attention to reestablishing a reasonable and fair procedure for the investigation of criminal allegations of our top officials and that the legislation we consider at that time contain the necessary protections against abuses of power. The bill we are introducing today is our best effort at drafting such legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the City of Tecumseh, Michigan, as it celebrates its 175th birthday. 
   Located in Lenawee County, Tecumseh was one of the first three settlements established in 1824 in what was then the Michigan Territory. The settlement's founders, Musgrove Evans, Joseph Brown and Austin Wing, chose its location because of its fertile soil, good supply of timber and its proximity to the Raisin River. They named their new home after the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh, who is said to have held war councils on the site. 
   A growing agricultural community, Tecumseh's first rail line was built in 1838, and train service continued until the late 1970s. Tecumseh was not only a stop on the actual railroad, but was also a stop on the Underground Railroad. Many people in Tecumseh displayed their strong anti-slavery sentiment, and their Quaker beliefs, by providing shelter to slaves escaping from the South. 
   Through the years, the landscape around Tecumseh has changed, as have the ways in which its people make their living. While it was primarily a small agricultural town, today the economy of Tecumseh mostly revolves around industry. In fact, its largest employer, Tecumseh Products, was founded in 1934 and grew to become a Fortune 500 company. 
   Mr. President, Tecumseh is notable for its significance in Michigan's history, but its most dependable asset over the last 175 years has been its people. It is fitting that we recognize Tecumseh's residents as they celebrate the past while looking to build an even better future. I know my colleagues will join me in offering the people of Tecumseh congratulations and best wishes on this important occasion.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the 1999 school year came to a close, our Nation was shocked by the incidences of school violence that claimed so many lives. In the aftermath of these tragedies, Americans have become more sensitized to the dangers of guns and the easy access that children have to them. Yet, despite this additional scrutiny by parents, guns continue to claim the lives of young people. Each day, more children are dying, not just in schoolyards, but in the home. They are killed by guns in unintentional shootings. 
   Unintentional shootings are among the leading causes of death for young people. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, each day at least one person under the age of 19 is killed by an unintentional shooting. Unsafe guns are an enormous danger to these young people, who are the victims of 33 percent of all accidental firearm deaths. And in Michigan, people under the age of 19 make up more than 50 percent of the fatalities caused by unintentional shootings. 
   Unintentional shootings almost always occur at home, when a child finds a loaded weapon and while playing with it, shoots himself, a sibling, or a young friend. Some parents try to take precautions against these tragedies by hiding their firearm in a drawer, a closet or even under the mattress. Unfortunately, if it is loaded or without a safety lock, it does not matter where that gun is hidden. It has the potential to kill, and for hundreds of kids each year, it does just that. 
   Daily shootings resulting from the careless storage of guns can easily be prevented. Locking devices for guns are simple to handle and inexpensive, but they must be used. In the Juvenile Justice bill that passed the Senate just a few weeks ago, an amendment was included that would require all sales, deliveries or transfers of handguns to include a secure gun storage or safety device, which was a step in the right direction. But, there was nothing to require that adults, especially with children in the house, use those safety devices. Safe storage laws, or Child Access Prevention, CAP, laws are needed to ensure that adults store loaded guns with safety devices in place and in locations reasonably inaccessible to children. 
   There is no doubt that owning a firearm requires precaution and responsibility, especially when young children are around. CAP laws hold adults criminally responsible if a loaded firearm was left where it could be reasonably accessed by a juvenile, and the juvenile uses or brings into public the adult's firearm without the permission of his parent or guardian. Criminal liability would not apply to adults who have no reasonable expectation of having a juvenile on their premises or if a juvenile obtains a firearm as a result of an unlawful entry. CAP laws simply require adults to use common sense safety measures, such as secure gun storage devices or trigger locks for their firearms. 
   Currently, there are 16 States that have enacted CAP laws. And since the first law took effect 10 years ago, state CAP laws have reduced unintentional deaths of children by firearms on an average of 23 percent. In Florida, just one year after CAP was enacted, unintentional shootings dropped more than 50 percent. And for every state that has enacted a safe storage law, there is compelling evidence that because of CAP, children are safer at home. 
   Despite these successes, there are still an overwhelming number of states, including Michigan, without CAP laws. And until there is awareness that guns should be locked up and stored unloaded, guns will continue to claim the lives of innocent children. Until CAP or safe storage laws are the law of the land, people will continue to learn the hard way that the guns in their home meant for protection will continue to claim the lives of those they are trying to protect.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special person who will be honored on June 28, Frank D. Stella. 
   A ballroom in Cobo Hall in my hometown of Detroit will be filled next Monday with people from all walks of life who have been touched by this remarkable man. In 1946, after serving in World War II, Frank Stella established The F.D. Stella Products Company, a food service and dining equipment design and distribution company, in Detroit. He built his business into one of the most successful of its kind in Michigan, and throughout the years he has used his success to give back to his community. But he is also recognized across the country and worldwide as a leader in the Italian-American community. 
   I will not list all of the business, national, international, civic, fraternal, religious, veterans and social organizations that Frank Stella belongs to--the list is so long, my colleagues might accuse me of trying to filibuster. But I would like to highlight a few of the honors he has received because I believe that they illustrate just how many lives he has touched. In Metro Detroit, Frank has been recognized for his commitment to the community with many awards, including the Special Distinguished Humanitarian Award by the Arab and Chaldean Community Council, the Distinguished Service Award by Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall, the State of Israel Bonds Award and the Summit Award by the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce. Frank's humanitarian works have also received recognition outside Michigan. He has been invested as a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and was given Italy's highest decoration by the President and Prime Minister of Italy in 1991. 
   Frank Stella is a man of countless talents and immeasurable dedication. But Frank has something else, too, something he uses periodically to the benefit of the people of Metro Detroit, to wit, clout. While we all know people with clout, Frank's clout is unique. Yes, he has known Presidents, from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. He has met the Pope and Mother Teresa. He counts among his friends famous entertainers like Sophia Loren, John Travolta and Tony Bennett. But Frank Stella may be the only individual in the United States who could convince the ``Three Tenors,'' Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras to make their only U.S. concert appearance this year (and one of only three worldwide) at Tiger Stadium in Detroit on July 17. This concert will not only be the rarest of treats for Metro Detroit music lovers, but it will also raise a significant amount of money for the Michigan Opera Theatre's $25 million capital campaign. 
   Mr. President, Frank Stella wears many hats, including those of a businessman, a humanitarian, a community leader and a father. But for those in attendance at Cobo Hall next Monday night, the most important hat that Frank wears is that of friend. The invitation to the gala encourages people to ``Please be Frank with us.'' But, as everyone knows, there is only one Frank Stella. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Frank on his years of success in so many arenas, and in thanking him for the truly remarkable contributions he has made to our country.

   I would like to address a question to the chairman of the committee to see if he would be willing to consider this question. It has to do with a bill which the good Senator from Delaware introduced to modify section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 in order to strengthen the utility of that section.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of legislation to repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility of 1996, I am pleased that this bill contains language to prevent traffic delays at the Canadian border. 
   Section 110, which was scheduled to go into effect on September 30, 1998, would have required the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to document every alien's arrival in and departure from the United States through an automated entry-exit control system. The Omnibus appropriations act for FY1999 included a compromise provision I cosponsored to delay Section 110 for 30 months. I stated then that Section 110 should not be just delayed, but repealed, because the cost of any such entry-exit system would far exceed its benefits. The vote today replaces the requirements of Section 110 with a feasibility study to determine whether any such system could be developed without increasing congestion or border crossing delays. 
   Section 110, if applied to Canadian nationals would place an unnecessary burden on the hundreds of thousands of motorists who cross the border daily. In 1996, over 116 million U.S. and Canadian border crossers traveled by land to the United States. Instituting a check for each one of these border crossers would create enormous delays at the 250 points of entry, and would have an especially damaging impact on the businesses, trade, and tourism in Michigan and other northern border states. U.S. trade with Canada, our largest trading partner, generates approximately $1 billion of commerce and tourism daily. Any loss of this revenue would be devastating to my State. 
   This provision to repeal the Section 110 requirements at land border and sea ports is vital for Michigan communities and businesses, and I am very pleased that the Senate is addressing this important issue.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor a legendary figure in the civil rights movement in Michigan, Dr. Lionel Swan. Dr. Swan died last Wednesday at the age of 93, leaving behind a reputation as an extraordinarily effective leader in the struggle for civil rights. 
   Dr. Swan was a living example of the great things that can be accomplished when you combine determination, courage and dignity. Dr. Swan put himself through college and medical school by working during the day. He often related a story of an incident which strengthened his resolve to continue on this hard path to his goal of becoming a doctor. One day, a white man called Dr. Swan ``boy'' and threw a cigarette butt on a floor he had just finished mopping. Dr. Swan is said to have responded, ``Mister, I want to thank you. I've been debating whether I should leave this job for college and you just convinced me I've got to do it so the next time I see somebody like you, he can't call me boy.'' 
   Dr. Swan was able to ignore ugly slights and concentrate on what is most important in life. Dr. Swan went on to graduate from Howard University Medical School and practice medicine in Detroit. He was elected President of the National Medical Association and the Detroit Medical Society, where he led the effort to allow African-American physicians to practice medicine at the former Harper and Grace hospitals. Dr. Swan was also a longtime, active  member of the NAACP, helping found the Detroit NAACP's Freedom Fund Dinner which raises money annually for its many worthwhile goals and is one of the largest gatherings in the country. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Swan was always firm in principle and gentle in demeanor. He let his actions serve as an example to others in the fight for equality and civil rights. I was a great personal fan of his. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Dr. Swan on his life's many outstanding achievements.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we in the United States have become known around the world for providing what can only be called the gold standards of health care. People come to the United States from all over the world to receive our high-quality health care. Yet I find that too many of my constituents are not receiving this world-renowned health care. Due to current practices in the managed care area, too many HMOs are denying critically needed care to too many of their beneficiaries. 
   For instance, in Detroit, I met with Donald Anderson, a quadriplegic who is in a wheelchair. When he changed jobs, he also changed health care providers. Donald told me that his new provider would not cover a rolling commode wheelchair for him after the wheel broke on the one he owned, even though his doctor classified the wheelchair as a medical necessity. The HMO told him that the chair, which he uses to take showers, is considered a luxury item. His physician intervened and tried to get Donald a rolling commode but was repeatedly denied. 
   In Detroit, I also met with Amaka Onumono, who had been recovering from injuries sustained when a man dumped hot grease on her and set part of her home on fire. She spoke about gaps in service because she needed to get a referral from her primary care physician after every 12 visits to her occupational therapist. ``Every time it comes time to make an appointment, there is a hassle,'' her mother Denise Avery said. 
   In Lansing, I spoke with Dr. William Weil, a Michigan State University pediatrician, who said that some families whose children have chronic illnesses frequently have trouble getting HMOs to approve pediatric subspecialists, especially if none is located in the immediate community. ``In many HMOs,  there is a tendency to use neurologists and orthopedists who specialize only in the care of adults,'' Dr. Weil told me. 
   In Midland, MI, I spoke with Dr. James Bicknell, head of the emergency room at Mid Michigan Medical Center. He told me that problems sometimes occur when managed care personnel, by telephone, tried to screen people out of the emergency room. Dr. Bicknell said that ``managed care companies should be held accountable if patients are harmed because companies deny care.'' 
   Stories such as these necessitate reforming the managed care area, which is why passage of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights is so crucial. Let's take the previous examples and apply the Patients' Bill of Rights--a strong one--to see what would have happened to these people had that legislation been enacted. 
   Donald Anderson would have received a rolling commode, since his doctor determined it was medically necessary. A strong Patients' Bill of Rights allows the physician, not the insurance company, to decide what prescriptions and equipment are medically necessary. 
   Amaka Onumono, the burn victim, would not have had to get a new referral every time she needed to see a specialist under a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. Our bill would allow the patient with a chronic health problem to have a standing referral to see such a specialist. 
   The patients of Dr. William Weil, the MSU pediatrician, would not have been denied access to pediatric specialists. The strong Patients' Bill of Rights specifically maintains that an 
   individual should have access to a specialist, including, in the case of a child, the appropriate pediatric expertise. 
   In the case of Dr. James Bicknell, our Patients' Bill of Rights mandates that all patients receive emergency treatment if a prudent layperson considers the patient's condition to be ``an emergency medical condition.'' So our health care programs, our strong Patients' Bill of Rights, would hold health plans accountable for the decisions they make. 
   I have heard similar stories all over my home State of Michigan. While most HMOs do a good job of providing quality health care while managing costs, too many put money before good medicine. A good, strong, national Patients' Bill of Rights would establish a Federal framework that would provide very high quality assurance for patients all over the country. 
   There is overwhelming support in the public for managed care reform. That would include, necessarily, the following patient protections: 
   First, ensure that treatment decisions are made by a patient's doctor, not a bureaucrat at an insurance company. 
   Second, hold managed care plans accountable when their decisions to withhold or limit care injure patients. 
   Third, ensure that patients undergoing treatment can continue to see the same health care provider if their provider leaves the plan or their employer changes plans. 
   Fourth, allow patients to see an outside specialist at no additional cost whenever the specialist in their plan can't meet their needs. 
   Fifth, require that insurance companies pay for emergency services if a reasonable person would consider the situation to be an emergency. 
   Sixth, promote access to clinical trials that may save time. 
   The idea of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights is not a radical notion. Doctors, for instance, are strongly in favor of this. Doctors who receive years of training and specialization are too often now being told by managed care companies they cannot provide the care that they deem to be appropriate. When doctors are no longer making the decisions they were trained to make, something is wrong. 
   What is wrong is that too many HMOs are not providing the services which the American public has a right to expect. The way to right this is to adopt a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope the Senate will take this real-life issue up promptly, resolve it, and adopt a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, Vice President GORE released a new study focusing on the connection between young adults and gun crimes. This report, jointly prepared by the Departments of Treasury and Justice, documents an alarmingly high rate of gun violence among 18 to 20 year olds. 
   The report shows that while 18, 19, and 20 years olds make up only 4 percent of the U.S. population, they commit an astounding 24 percent of gun murders in our country. In addition, the report shows that 18 year olds commit 35 percent more gun murders than 21 year olds; double the gun murders of 24 year olds; triple the gun murders of 28 year olds; and four times the gun murders of 30 year olds. 
   There are several loopholes in our current firearms laws that permit young people access to handguns and other deadly weapons. We must close those loopholes, especially for the 18 to 20 year olds, who contribute to such a high percentage of gun crimes. One of those loopholes allows 18 to 20 year olds, minors, to purchase handguns from unlicensed dealers, private collectors or friends, even though it would be illegal for them to purchase the same handgun from a federally licensed dealer. 
   There are also additional loopholes in federal law that permit 18 to 20 year olds to purchase semiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices from anyone willing to sell them. These weapons, such as AK-47s and Uzis, and the 50 rounds per minute clips that accompany them, are not the type of weapons needed for hunting, they are the type needed for killing, and that is what they are too often used for. 
   There is strong precedent for imposing minimum age requirements for engaging in dangerous activities. Congress and the states worked together in the past to minimize public safety concerns by ensuring that states raised their legal drinking ages to 21. This was in response to evidence that young adults were involved in proportionately far more driving accidents while intoxicated. Increasing the age requirement for drinking alcohol, reduced automobile accidents dramatically. And, in the first year after Michigan raised its drinking age from 18 to 21, there was a 21 percent decline in alcohol related deaths among drivers age 18 to 20. 
   Most recently, a report to be released today by a national commission studying the impact of gambling will apparently recommend that the minimum age for all forms of gambling be raised to 21. Although currently most casinos require gamblers to be 21, other forms of gambling, such as state lotteries have an age requirement of 18. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission contends that there should be tighter restrictions on state lotteries and other forms of betting because of the dangers and risks of excessive gambling. 
   Surely if there are clear and compelling reasons to prevent young people from drinking and gambling, there are even better reasons, as documented by the Gore report, to prevent 18, 19 and 20 year olds from owning an assault weapon or a handgun. I am a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator SCHUMER, S. 891, that would prohibit the sale or transfer of these weapons to young adults as well as prohibit possession of these weapons by those under 21, while maintaining exemptions under current law. In my judgment, it is critical that Congress act quickly to close these loopholes.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Joe Beyrle, a World War II veteran and long-time friend from Norton Shores, Michigan. Joe Beyrle's service during the war was truly extraordinary. 
   As an eighteen-year-old in 1942, Joe Beyrle enlisted in the Army, later volunteering for the parachute infantry. Joe quickly distinguished himself as a member of the 101st Airborne Division stationed in England. Early in his service Joe was twice chosen to make dangerous jumps into Nazi-occupied France while fitted with bandoliers filled with gold for the French Resistance. Joe's last jump into France was on the night before D-Day with the objective of destroying two wooden bridges behind Utah Beach. However, while on his way to accomplish this mission, Joe was captured by the Germans. 
   On June 10, 1944, the parents of Joe Beryle received a letter from the United States Government informing them that their son had perished while serving his country in France. On September 17, 1944, family and friends held a funeral mass for Joe at St. Joseph's Church in Muskegon, Michigan. However, Joe was still alive and being held in a POW camp. A dead German soldier wearing an American uniform and Joe's dog tags had been mistakenly identified as Joe. 
   Joe was eventually able to escape from his captors and later joined a Russian tank unit to continue the fight against the Germans. Joe fought with the Russians until an injury forced him to be sent to a Moscow hospital. When he finally regained his strength, Joe went to the American Embassy in Moscow and was eventually sent back to the United States. On September 14, 1946, almost two years after the funeral mass in his honor, Joe Beyrle married his wife, JoAnne, in the very same church. 
   I ask to have printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article which appeared recently in the Detroit Free Press regarding Joe Beyrle. The article highlights in greater detail the extraordinary experience of Joe Beryle during World War II. I know my Senate Colleagues will join me in honoring Joe Beyrle on his tremendous sacrifice and service to our nation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers have accepted the amendment that I introduced along with Senators DEWINE, VOINOVICH, MOYNIHAN and AKAKA, adding funds to help combat zebra mussels and other invasive species which infest U.S. waterways. The funds provided will allow the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to meet its responsibilities under the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 to research, develop and demonstrate environmentally sound techniques for managing and removing aquatic nuisance species that threaten public infrastructure in U.S. waters. The Corps' efforts complement the work of other agencies to limit the introduction and spread of new species, providing a desperately needed aquatic invasive species control program. 
   Mr. President, Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes degrade and disrupt the ecosystem; they endanger other indigenous species, either by consuming their food supply or smothering them, and zebra mussels cause grave economic impacts as they damage public infrastructure. Similar nonindigenous species infestations harm virtually every U.S. waterway and coastal area. Over the years, legislation to prevent and control these invasive species has received strong bipartisan, multi-regional support as a testimony to the serious threat they pose. 
   The Committee bill includes some other important items for Michigan and the Great Lakes. These include: 
   $400,000 for preconstruction, engineering and designing improvements to the locks in Sault Ste. Marie. 
   $1.7 million to repair the north and south piers and revetments at Pentwater Harbor. 
   $100,000 to complete a study on Environmental Dredging in Detroit River. 
   $250,000 for corrections to deficiencies associated with the Clinton River Spillway. 
   $100,000 to complete seawall construction, dredging and other work associated with the establishment of the Robert V. Annis Water Resource Institute at Grand Valley State University. 
   $200,000 for planning and design of sea lamprey barriers at sites throughout the Great Lakes basin. As my colleagues may know, the sea lamprey is a devastating invasive species that has plagued the Great Lakes since it first appeared and these barriers play an important role in preventing this species spread and population growth. 
   Funding for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) 
   Mr. President, on balance, this is a good bill, despite the budget constraints that the managers faced in putting it together.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senators THOMPSON and VOINOVICH and a bipartisan group of our colleagues in introducing the Federalism Accountability Act of 1999. The bill would require an explicit statement of Federal preemption in Federal legislation in order for such preemption to occur unless there exists a direct conflict between the Federal law and a State or local law which cannot be reconciled. Enactment of this bill would close the back door of implied Federal preemption and put the responsibility for determining whether or not State or local governments should be preempted back in Congress, where it belongs. The bill would also institute procedures to ensure that, in issuing new regulations, federal agencies respect State and local authority. 
   Mr. President, we want to ensure that the federal government works in partnership with our State and local government colleagues. One way of making sure this happens is that preemption occurs only when Congress makes a conscious decision to preempt and it is amply clear to all parties that preemption will occur. In 1991, I sponsored a bill, S. 2080, to clarify when preemption does and does not occur. I have since sponsored two similar bills. When I introduced S. 2080, I noted that ``state and local officials have become increasingly concerned with the number of instances in which State and local laws have been preempted by Federal law--not because Congress has done so explicitly, but because the courts have implied such preemption. Since 1789, Congress has enacted approximately 350 laws specifically preempting State and local authority. Half of these laws have been enacted in the last 20 years. These figures, however, do not touch upon the extensive Federal preemption of State and local authority which has occurred as a result of judicial interpretation of congressional intent, when Congress' intention to preempt has not been explicitly stated in law. When Congress is unclear about its intent to preempt, the courts must then decide whether or not preemption was intended and, if so, to what extent.'' 
   In the ensuing time, there have been some changes, such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, which have strengthened the partnership between the federal, state and local governments. Unfortunately, in the big picture, there has been little or no evidence of a change in the trends that I attempted to address when I introduced S. 2080 in 1991. Sometimes we enact a law and it is clear as to the scope of the intended preemption. Just as often, we are not clear, or a court takes language that appeared to be clear and decides that it is not, and construes it in favor of preemption. Similarly, agencies take actions that are determined to be preemptive whether their language is clear or not. 
   Article VI of the Constitution, the supremacy clause, states that Federal laws made pursuant to the Constitution ``shall be the supreme law of the land.'' In its most basic sense, this clause means that a State law is negated or preempted when it is in conflict with a constitutionally enacted Federal law. A significant body of case law has been developed to arrive at standards by which to judge whether or not Congress intended to preempt State or local authority--standards which are subjective and have not resulted in a consistent and predictable doctrine in resolving preemption questions. 
   If we in Congress want Federal law to prevail, we should be clear about that. If we want the States to have discretion to go beyond Federal requirements, we should be clear about that. If, for example, we set a floor in a Federal statute, but are silent on actions which meet but then go beyond the Federal requirement, State and local governments should be able to act as they deem appropriate. State and local governments should not have to wait to see what they can and cannot do. Our bill would allow tougher State and local laws given congressional silence. 
   In addition, the bill contains a requirement that agencies notify, and consult with, state and local governments and their representative organizations during the development of rules, and publish proposed and final federalism assessments along with proposed and final rules. Mr. President, it  should not be necessary to enact legislation to accomplish these things. Federal agencies should never issue rules without having the best and most complete information possible. Our State and local governments are ready, willing, and able to provide their expertise on how Federal rules will impact those governments' ability to get their jobs done. Common sense dictates that they be notified and consulted before the federal government regulates in a way that weakens or eliminates the ability of State and local governments to do their jobs, or duplicates their efforts. 
   The current Administration and previous ones have recognized the value of having federal agencies consult with State and local governments. However, as was amply demonstrated by a recent GAO report, Executive Order requirements for federalism assessments have been ignored. The bill would correct this noncompliance by the Executive Branch, and ensure that independent agencies, as well, will engage in such consultation and publish assessments along with rules. 
   Not only will the compilation and issuance of federalism assessments force the agencies to think through what they are doing, they will bolster the confidence of the public and regulated entities in the regulatory process by assuring them that their governments are acting in concert and avoiding conflicting or duplicative requirements. 
   Our legislation also requires the Congressional Budget Office, with the assistance of the Congressional Research Service, at the end of each Congress, to compile a report on the number of statutory and judicially interpreted preemptions. This will constitute the first time such a complete report has been done, and the information will be valuable to the debate regarding the appropriate use of preemption to reach Federal goals. 
   Mr. President, legislation to clarify when preemption occurs and otherwise strengthen the intergovernmental relationship has been endorsed by the major state and local government organizations. I would like to thank Senators THOMPSON and VOINOVICH and their staffs for their hard work in this area.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our nation has been riveted by the violence in Littleton, CO and Conyers, GA and our youth's easy access to guns. Communities have become increasingly concerned about their own schools and are more sensitized to the dangers of youth violence. Yet, despite this scrutiny, firearms continue to claim the lives of our young people. Every day on the average, another 14 children in America are killed with guns because of the gaping loopholes in our Federal firearms laws. We took steps to eliminate some of these loopholes during Senate consideration of the juvenile justice bill. Unfortunately, the legislation passed by the Senate did not go far enough to reduce the easy availability of lethal weapons to persons who should not have them. 
   Today, I saw an ABC News Wire report called ``Michigan sting operation shows felons can buy guns.'' According to this report, two investigators in Michigan, one posing as a felon and the other as his friend, went to ten different firearms dealers to purchase guns. Remember, selling a gun to a felon is illegal but these investigators had no problems with the gun dealers they approached. Out of the 10 dealers in this investigation, nine reportedly allowed, apparently, illegal purchases. In total, 37 guns were apparently purchased illegally during this selling spree. And still, the NRA wants Congress to expand the loopholes in our firearms laws, rather than taking modest steps to close them. 
   Since the moment the Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill, NRA lobbyists in Washington have been working around the clock to lobby Members of the House of Representatives. The NRA has named as its ``top priority, the defeat of any Lautenberg-style gun show amendment in the U.S. House.'' The Lautenberg amendment, adopted by the Senate, simply requires dealers at gun shows to follow the same rules as other gun dealers, by using the existing Brady system for background checks. It accomplishes this goal without creating any new burdens for law-abiding citizens and without any additional fees imposed on gun sellers or gun buyers. But the NRA wants to create additional loopholes by creating a special category of gun show dealers, who would be exempt from even the most minimum standards. They also want to weaken the bill by establishing a 24-hour limit on the time that vendors have to complete background checks, rather than the current standard of 3 business days, the time the FBI says is necessary. It will be a sad day if the NRA can successfully lobby the House to eliminate these moderate proposals in the Juvenile Justice bill. 
   I hope the House will amend its current bill to include language, passed by the Senate, to limit the importation of large capacity ammunition devices, clips that domestic companies were prohibited from manufacturing in 1994. Again, this is a moderate measure designed to keep clips with rounds as high as 250 off our streets and out of the hands of young people. 
   As the House begins their consideration of the juvenile justice bill next week, I hope it will strengthen, not weaken, the moderate gun control measures that we passed in the Senate. For example, Congress should take steps to prevent unintentional shootings, which occur as a result of unsafe storage of guns. These daily tragedies, resulting from the careless storage of guns, can easily be prevented by requiring the use of locking devices for guns, which are inexpensive and easy to use. We should also take steps to eliminate illegal gun trafficking and ban semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns for persons under 21 years of age. 
   The legislation passed in the Senate was a step in the right direction, but those moderate reforms are in jeopardy if Congress allows our legislative priorities to be dictated by the NRA.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against both of these amendments, although they are well intended. 
   The first amendment has the problem that it would not accommodate changes in specifications in order to allow new technologies to be inserted which cost more than the specified technology in the cost cap. 
   That may be a lot of verbiage, but it is important. I have been very active in cost caps. I proposed a cost cap, for instance, for the new CVN-77. I supported the cost cap that we previously wrote in to the F-22, and supported it very strongly. But, in both of those instances, the cost caps allowed for the new technology possibility. If new technologies come along which are not in the specifications, we should want them to be considered. We should not make it difficult or impossible for new technologies to be considered. We should want them, if that would make the plane more effective, providing the Secretary certifies to us--or notifies us, more accurately--that there is a change. That is not a loophole. That is something which is desirable, it seems to me. I emphasize the cost cap--for instance in the CVN-77, which I wrote--contained the exception that if there is a new technology which the Secretary of the Navy certifies to us is desirable, that then would be an exception to the cost cap.

I think that is very good.

   Mr. LEVIN. The Comptroller General must concur with the Secretary's certification. I believe that is a clear violation of the separation of powers. In Bowsher v. Synar, the Supreme Court ruled:  
   To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control over the execution of the laws.  
   So, except for that part requiring a legislative concurrence or legislative officer's concurrence with the Secretary's certification, I think that amendment would have been acceptable. With that additional provision, I think it is unacceptable as it violates separation of powers and the Supreme Court ruling in the Bowsher case.

   Mr. LEVIN. Section 1061(a) of the amendment would require the President to promptly notify Congress whenever an ``investigation'' is undertaken. The term ``investigation'' is not defined in the amendment. 
   I am concerned that some could interpret this to require the President to report to Congress every time the executive branch receives an allegation, even before the Justice Department or others have an opportunity to determine whether the allegations are based in fact. Such an interpretation could lead to the disclosure of a flood of unsubstantiated allegations to Congress, with a resulting injustice to innocent individuals who may be the subject of such allegations.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator BINGAMAN has just put in the RECORD the extensive actions that are taken in this bill in order to enhance security at these labs, actions which were taken after some very thoughtful debate and discussion by the Armed Services Committee. Senator BINGAMAN has outlined those for the RECORD and for the Nation. 
   I want to put in the RECORD at this time the summary of the amendment that we adopted here today. Senator LOTT offered an amendment earlier today. It was modified somewhat. In essence, it does some of the following things: 
   First, it requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an investigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of export control laws. It would require the President to notify Congress whenever an export license or waiver is granted on behalf of any person who is the subject of a criminal investigation. It would require the Secretary of Defense to undertake certain actions that would enhance the performance and effectiveness of the Department of Defense program for monitoring so-called satellite launch campaigns. It would enhance the intelligence community's role in the export license review process. It proposes a mechanism for determining the extent to which the classified nuclear weapons information has been released by the Department of Energy. It proposes putting the FBI in charge of conducting security background investigations of DOE laboratory employees. 
   These are a long list of actions which are now in this bill, that started off in this bill from the Armed Services Committee that had been improved on the floor today. To suggest that we are not doing anything relative to trying to clamp down on espionage activities which have been going on for 20 years at these labs, it seems to me, is a total misstatement of what is in this bill that we will be voting on in a few minutes.

   Mr. LEVIN. This was prepared by Senator LOTT's staff. Again, there were some slight modifications in this, which Senator LOTT agreed to, which I proposed prior to the adoption of the amendment. This, in essence, is the summary of the Lott amendment. This, plus the numerous provisions in the Senate bill that came out of the Armed Services Committee, a commission on safeguarding security, counterintelligence at the facility, background check investigations now going on that had not been taking place, 
   polygraph examinations, monetary penalties to be added to the criminal penalties, moratorium on laboratory-to-laboratory and foreign visitors in assignment programs, counterintelligence and intelligence program activities being organized, whistle-blower protection, notification of Congress of certain security and counterintelligence failures at these labs. 
   This is a significant effort on the part of the Armed Services Committee. It was supplemented by the full Senate today. I don't think we ought to denigrate this effort on the part of the Armed Services Committee or of the Senate in adopting the amendment we adopted today by just suggesting we are not doing anything because in a few hours prior to a recess, without one hearing on the subject, we are not reorganizing the Department of Energy without even hearing from the Secretary of Energy. I think that suggestion is a denigration of what is in this bill, which was thoughtfully placed in this bill by the Armed Services Committee, and a denigration of the amendment of the majority leader, which we adopted here this morning on this floor. 
   We should not characterize these kinds of efforts and diminish these kinds of efforts by sort of saying we are not doing anything before we are going home on recess. We are doing an awful lot, and there is more to be done. But we ought to do it in a way that will do credit to this institution, the Senate. We ought to do it promptly after the recess. We ought to do it after a hearing, where the Secretary of Energy is heard. The head of the Department should at least be heard. We received a letter from him today. Do we not want to hear from him prior to reorganizing the Department? That is not thoughtful. 
   That is not the way to proceed to close the hole. That is a way of precipitously trying to do something and trying to get some advantage from the refusal of others to go along with that kind of precipitous action. But more important, I believe it would denigrate the significant steps that are in this bill, both as it came to the floor and as it was added by the majority leader  with modifications, which I suggested, and that work is significant. It will close, we hope, most of the holes that have been in these labs in terms of trying to protect against espionage for 20 years, where nothing was done until finally last year the President issued a Presidential directive that started the process of tightening up the security at these laboratories. 
   We should be proud of these efforts. They were done thoughtfully in committee by the majority leader, by Senators on the floor. We should not denigrate them and simply slough them off because there is not a precipitous reorganization of the entire Department 2 hours before the recess, without even having a hearing on the subject and hearing from the Secretary of the Department.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss concealed weapons laws. Currently, in Michigan, if a person wants to obtain a permit for a concealed weapon, he or she must apply at the local county gun board. Each one of these gun boards is made up of three members: the local sheriff, county prosecutor and a designee of the state police. The gun boards base their decisions on a person's demonstrated need for a gun, and that person's criminal record, if any, and on local conditions. 
   Local decisionmaking makes sense. Local law enforcement officials know the local environment, local citizens, and can best assess the local impact of increasing the numbers of weapons carried in public. Last night, the Michigan State Senate passed a bill that, if signed into law, would take discretion away from local gun boards and put more weapons on our streets and in public places. In my view, eliminating the authority of local gun boards would be detrimental to public safety in Michigan and take us in the opposite direction than we are heading in Congress. More important than my opinions are the views of the law enforcement community in Michigan. Every major law enforcement agency in the state of Michigan including the State Police, Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, Michigan Prosecuting Attorneys Association, Michigan Municipal League as well as many other organizations such as the Michigan Municipal League have made statements opposing this bill. 
   One of the bills that is now before a conference committee of the Michigan Legislature is referred to as a ``shall issue'' bill. The NRA has been lobbying Michigan legislators to support a ``shall issue'' policy. The legislation is called ``shall issue'' because it mandates that if a person passes an FBI Federal background check, the gun board ``shall issue'' him a permit to carry a concealed weapon, without requiring a show of need or the condition of other local circumstances. 
   This legislation goes in the wrong direction. It would increase the danger of gun violence in our communities. I have seen no evidence, that people who have a legitimate need to carry a gun for protection are being denied the ability to do so. The numbers demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of requests for concealed weapons permits are approved. It's important for public safety that local gun boards continue to make such judgments. 
   Here in Congress, we are working hard to reduce the easy availability of lethal weapons to people who should not have them. I do not want to see my State go in the other direction by passing a law that encourages the spread of concealed weapons in public places. 
   Michigan has not been the only state targeted for these NRA-backed concealed weapons bills. Yet, despite the best efforts of the NRA, the ``shall issue'' policy has been rejected by a bipartisan group of legislators in more than 10 States. That's because of the power of people in those States who united to demand action. Voters in the State of Missouri recently defeated a ``shall issue'' proposal much like the one in the Michigan Legislature. Missourians voted to keep in place prudent regulations for carrying concealed weapons--regulations that were first enacted in reaction to the days of Jesse James and the outlaw gangs. 
   I believe the majority of Michigan's citizens feel the same way.

   I don't think the Senator from Nebraska is willing or should be willing to agree to a time agreement yet because he has not heard the debate on the other side. 
   I suggest the debate on BRAC begin at noon--we change the unanimous consent--instead of 11:45, and hope that at least there is a chance that this debate could in 35 minutes be completed but not ``bake'' that into the unanimous consent.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, from 1989 to 1997 the Department of Defense reduced the total active-duty military end strength by 32 percent. That figure is going to grow to 36 percent by 2003, over a third reduction in our end strength will be achieved by 2003. We are already about a third. 
   Even after four base closure rounds, the reduction in the Department's base structure in the United States has been reduced only 21 percent. The Department of Defense analysis concluded that the Department has about 23 percent excess capacity in its current base structure. 
   Let me give a few examples of that excess that we are now funding, spending taxpayers' money supporting, which is no longer needed. 
   The Army will have reduced the personnel at its classroom training commands by 43 percent, but the classroom space has only been reduced by 7 percent--personnel reductions, 43 percent in classroom training commands but the space only by 7 percent. 
   Why do we want to maintain all that excess classroom space that is not being used? What is the point of doing that? The answer to me; it is pointless. The uniformed military are saying: Please let us close it. 
   The Air Force will have reduced the number of fighters and other small aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, but the base structure for those aircraft will be only 35 percent smaller. The Navy will have 33 percent more hangers for its aircraft than it requires. 
   And on and on. 
   Secretary Cohen's report to us documents substantial savings that have been achieved from past base closure rounds. It has been argued that those savings can't be audited. What the CBO says about that argument is that firm measures of BRAC savings that were requested by the Congress do not and, indeed, cannot exist. That is because BRAC savings are really avoided costs. They are the difference between what the Department of Defense actually spent and what it would have had to have spent in the absence of the BRAC action. Because the latter is never actually observed, the figures for BRAC savings that the Department of Defense provides will never be firm measures; they must always be estimates. 
   Then the CBO says--talking about the Department of Defense report on savings--that the report's basic message is consistent with the CBO's own conclusion: Past and future BRAC rounds will lead to significant savings for the Department of Defense. 
   That, it seems to me, is the heart of the measure.

   Mr. LEVIN. The heart of the matter, it seems to me, is that our auditors, our budget experts, have said that it is their conclusion that ``past and future BRAC rounds will lead to significant savings for the Department of Defense.'' 
   What are those estimates of savings? By 2001, the Department estimates that BRAC actions will produce a total of $14.5 billion in net savings. After 2001, when all BRAC actions must be completed, steady State savings will be $5.7 billion per year. This is just from past base closure rounds, which some Members say can't be audited in terms of precise savings. 
   That is a lot of money, $5.7 billion per year--steady State savings. Is it possibly $5.6 billion or $5.8 billion? Nobody can state with certainty. It is significant. 
   What can be stated is what the CBO's conclusion is, that these are significant savings and are similar to the kind of savings that the CBO believes are achieved with base closing. 
   Last July, as I indicated, the CBO gave their own conclusions, so while we can debate this issue on the floor about audit trails and how precise the estimates are, our auditors, our experts, have reached the critical conclusion that the savings, indeed, are significant. 
   Earlier this month we received letters from Secretary Cohen, from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, from all of the Joint Chiefs, from the Secretaries of the Army and the Navy and the Air Force. In his letter, Secretary Cohen says the Department's ability to properly support America's men and women in uniform today and to sustain them into the future hinged in great measure on realizing this critical savings that only BRAC can provide. 
   Our ability to support the men and women in uniform depends on future savings from BRAC rounds. 
   A letter which we just received, signed by all six members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, makes their views crystal clear:  
   Simply stated, our military judgment is that further base closures are absolutely necessary.  
   Those are pretty strong words and these are our uniformed military leaders. On the Armed Services Committee, we put a lot of stock in their judgment on most issues. Once in a while we may disagree with them, as is our right and our duty, but when the top military leadership, civilian and uniform, in this Nation tell Members that more BRAC rounds are ``absolutely necessary'' we should take heed. 
   General Shelton said in last year's Department of Defense report:  
   I strongly support additional base closures. Without them, we will not leave our successors the war-fighting dominance of today's force.  
   That is not a political statement; that is a military man's statement. That has to do with warfighting dominance. 
   We can argue about audit trails or specifics on this floor, but when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says we will not leave our successors the warfighting dominance that we have in today's force without additional base closures, those are words which have a special meaning, it would seem to me, to all of the Members who have this special responsibility.  
   We have to face up to this responsibility. A decade ago, after years of prodding by Senator Goldwater and under the leadership of Senator Nunn and Senator WARNER, Congress had the vision and the courage to start the BRAC process. Just imagine the financial problems that we would have today if we could not count on the savings from previous BRAC rounds. If the Senators a decade ago did not succeed in persuading us to start the BRAC process, think of the problems we would have today. Those are the problems we are going to have 4, 5, 6, 7 years from now if we do not continuing a process, 
   if we do not continue the process, if we do not shed the excess infrastructure which is no longer needed.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress likes to ask the Joint Chiefs every once in awhile how much more money they think they need and where should we add it? What are their priorities? 
   Those are legitimate questions for us to ask. But they are also relatively pretty easy issues to address. Our duty as Members of Congress extends far beyond pitching and hitting softballs. We have an obligation to the men and women in uniform to listen to the Chiefs when they ask us to do something that is hard to do. 
   The Chiefs' opinions are important to us when following them is easy to do, when they give us their priorities if we can find some additional funds. But now they are asking us to do something that is hard politically to do, and that is to heed their advice, to close some additional bases. I do not know of anybody in the Department of Defense or anybody in this Chamber who likes closing bases. Not many people like going to the dentist or losing weight either. It is just a lot more fun to eat dessert than to look after your health. But we have an obligation--and it is difficult--in the best interests of this Nation, and for the health of our military, to do not what is easiest, but to do what is essential. 
   What is essential has been told to us very eloquently in 
   these letters from the Chiefs, in this letter from the Secretary of Defense, in this letter from the three Service Secretaries. These letters tell us as pointedly, dramatically, strongly, forcefully as they can, that it is essential that additional bases be closed. ``Our military judgment is that further base closures are absolutely necessary.'' 
   I began my few minutes of comments with that quote and I end them with that quote, because I hope we will all think about that as we make a politically tough decision on how to vote on the pending McCain-Levin amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. I greatly appreciate that. 
   Mr. President, we have had several years of debate now about the President's alleged role in the last base closure round on the privatization-in-place proposals for Sacramento and San Antonio. This just simply cannot be allowed to be an issue, and it should no longer be an issue. Because of the hard work of the Armed Services Committee, we just resolved the depot issue in a fair way. 
   Our amendment deals with the privatization-in-place issue by including language for the 2001 BRAC round that would allow privatization-in-place closing of a military installation only when it is recommended explicitly by the Base Closure Commission and when it is the most cost-effective approach. 
   Our amendment also ensures the entire BRAC process takes place after the next administration is in office. The  base closure statute explicitly recognizes already that the President can decide whether or not to have a BRAC round, and he can decide not to have a BRAC round simply by deciding not to nominate BRAC commissioners. If the new President decides not to have a BRAC round, he simply will not nominate the new commissioners. If there is a BRAC round, the new Secretary of Defense will oversee the process of the statutory steps in the round done under the new administration under the timetable which is in this amendment. 
   Short of banning people from even thinking about base closures until 2001, there is just really nothing more that can be done to ensure that there will be no politicization at all. I know there were strong feelings on the 1995 round. But I don't think we should keep punishing the taxpayers and keep spending money which we need for the men and women in uniform to have the right pay and the right equipment by continuing to raise the allegations which were leveled about the Sacramento and San Antonio actions. 
   As it turned out, by the way, things came out quite well. The bidding team that represented the privatization in place of those two facilities lost during a competitive bidding process. 
   We have to be willing to take the heat. We can no longer just say that the last round was politicized if, in fact, it was cured in the next round. We just cannot eternally and constantly look back at these allegations and debate what may or may not have happened in the 1995 round as an excuse for not doing our duty here in 1999 in terms of saving the money, which is so essential if we are going to have the defense budget rationally devoted and rationally spent. We are talking here about a significant chunk of money. We cannot waste this money. Our uniformed personnel and our civilian leadership are pleading with us to authorize an additional base closing round. This amendment assures that it is the next administration--not this one--which will determine whether to proceed with a base closing round. 
   All we would be doing is authorizing it. The next administration would be the one that would be administering this next round. It would not be this administration. 
   The timetable that we put in here assures every single statutory step, from picking the commissioners to do the work that is necessary to sending in the recommendations. All of that will take place with the new President and not with this President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering whether the Senator from Virginia would consider the following approach: after the disposition of the Murray amendment, that there then be an hour of debate on the Kerrey amendment and, immediately following the disposition of the Kerrey amendment, that the reconsideration vote occur on the Gramm amendment, precluding second-degree amendments to the Kerrey amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Nebraska for his amendment. What he has done is to bring back before us and before the Nation a very important issue, which is, what is the necessary level of nuclear weapons in our inventory for our own security. 
   Do we need as many as we have? Should we legislatively bake in that level if we do not need the START I level or should we at least be free to consider options to go to what the necessary level is for our own security? 
   The Senator's gift to us and to the Nation here is that he is bringing before us an issue which the Joint Chiefs want us to consider but we have not yet considered, and that is, what is the level of nuclear weapons that we need for our own security and should that be determined by a legislative level, on a piece of paper, set in law, or should that be determined by our security needs? 
   If we have a larger number of nuclear weapons than we need, we do two things. The Senator from California has just illuminated those two things. No. 1, if we have more nuclear weapons than we need for our own security, we are wasting valuable resources. That is No. 1. But, No. 2, what we are doing is we are then telling the Russians: Look, we're going to stay at this level, which in turn will encourage them, unhappily, to remain at the same level. That increases the proliferation threat to us because as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, the greatest threat to this Nation is the inventory of nuclear weapons on Russian soil. The Chinese threat does not come close. You are talking dozens in that case and not nearly as accurate. In the case of the Russians, you are talking many, many thousands of nuclear weapons which are not only pointed at us but also the more that are there on Russian soil, the greater the risk that one of them might be lost or not counted and leave Russian soil and get into the hands of a terrorist state or a terrorist group. 
   So both from a proliferation perspective and from the perspective of the wise use of our resources, we ought to at least be open to consider options of fewer nuclear weapons than the START I level provides for. 
   We may decide we want to stay at that level. It may be determined that we want to stay at that level. But the Joint Chiefs say that it may not be necessary. They want to consider options that would go down to a lower level of nuclear weapons, because they may not need as many nuclear weapons, regardless of what the Russians do. Even if the Russians stay at the START I level, we may not need as many nuclear weapons as the START I level allows us. 
   There is no point in keeping them just because the Russians have them if we do not need them. There is no point keeping them if that helps to push the Russians to keep their own, with all of the proliferation threats which that engenders. 
   I close by reading a couple answers that we have received to questions that I have addressed to Secretary Cohen and to General Shelton. 
   I asked Secretary Cohen:  
   Should we maintain the requirement in law that our forces be maintained at the START I level or should we now let that expire and do what our military requirements indicate we should do, rather than to put it in a legislative form?  
   Secretary Cohen's answer:  
   ..... I do not think we need to have the legislation, ..... . I think it is unnecessary..... .  
   General Shelton was even more pointed. General Shelton, in answer to that question, said:  
   I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language..... .

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. 
   General Shelton said:  
   I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that mandates specific force structure levels.  
   This is the highest level of uniform military leadership we have in this Nation. This is what he says:  
   The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider options that will reduce our strategic forces to the levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I legislative restraint will need to be removed before we can pursue these options. Major costs will be incurred if we remain at START I levels.  
   He went on:  
   The Service Chiefs and I agree it is time to reduce the number of our nuclear platforms to a level that is militarily sufficient to meet our national security needs..... .  
   ``[M]ilitarily sufficient to meet our national security needs..... .'' 
   General Shelton went on:  
   The statutory provision that keeps us at the START I level for both Trident SSBNs and Peacekeeper ICBMs will need to be removed before we can pursue these options.  
   So we have the leadership of this Nation's military--civilian and uniform--urging us not to have a restraint in law that will make it difficult for them to pursue options which they need to pursue in order to avoid the waste of resources, options which will allow us to be militarily sufficient and not to promote proliferation in Russia.

I didn't have a chance to thank him earlier today for his willingness to address the Trident submarine issue, even though he took a different position on the amendment of Senator KERREY, that part of that amendment really had been addressed, at least in committee, with the Trident reduction. While I very much supported Senator KERREY's amendment for the reasons that I gave, I didn't have an opportunity during that debate to thank Senator SMITH for his participation in addressing one part of that issue which the Defense Department was most anxious to address. I thank him for that as well.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, this amendment contains a funding cutoff that is far broader than the one that was contained in the Specter amendment that the Senate tabled yesterday. This would cut off funding effective October 1 for U.S. air or ground operations, including peacekeeping operations. So the Senator from New Hampshire has in no way stated inaccurately what this amendment does. It is his intention, and he said so quite clearly, that this amendment leads to the withdrawal of our effort, the termination, the ending of our effort in Serbia, including the air campaign. 
   The Senate voted just a few months ago, 58-to-41, to support that air campaign. What this amendment says is we want to terminate the air campaign. This would have the Senate blow hot and blow cold on the same issue, whether or not we want to support an air campaign which is presently going on. 
   At the same time, it tells Milosevic all you have to do is hang in there until October 1 and you will not even face an air campaign. You will not face any kind of campaign. You will have succeeded in Kosovo. 
   Milosevic has not accomplished what he set out to accomplish because he is under severe attack in Kosovo and in Serbia. He will accomplish what he set out to accomplish if this amendment passes. That will be the victory. That will seal the success for Milosevic if this amendment is agreed to, because this amendment cuts off all funds, including those for the air campaign to attempt to reduce Milosevic's military capability, which is our military mission, and our broader 
   mission will then be totally impossible. The broader mission is to return over 1 million refugees who have been burned out, who have been raped, whose villages have been destroyed--500 villages. Those refugees, then, will have no hope of returning. Whereas now they have, indeed, a very real hope of returning because Milosevic is gradually being weakened and his forces are under tremendous stress. There is great evidence of that all over. 
   The KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army, is beginning to move back in to their villages and into their homes. Nothing will scare Milosevic much more than having to face the KLA again, which will be the result of his failure to negotiate a settlement which provides for the return of these refugees in safety with protection. 
   We cannot allow Milosevic to succeed, which is what this amendment hands to him. We cannot allow Milosevic to shape the future of Europe. That is what his success would do. His ethnic cleansing, if not reversed, will shape Europe for the next century. 
   This century began with a genocide against the Armenians. It is ending with an ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars. And in between was a Holocaust. If we do not want the next century to be a repeat of this century, Milosevic cannot succeed. Europe's future is on the line and that means our own security is on the line. NATO's future is on the line. The adoption of this amendment will tell NATO they have failed. The adoption of this amendment will be the statement to Milosevic: You have succeeded. We are pulling out. 
   That is what the intention of this amendment is, according to its sponsor. This amendment will tell our 19 allies in NATO: Forget NATO. Forget NATO cohesion. Forget NATO unity. We are pulling out. 
   And this amendment will send the worst possible message to the most important of all the people, the men and women who wear our uniform who are out there in harm's way now, who would then be told by this amendment we are pulling out. 
   This Senate must send a very different message than that. I hope this amendment is tabled by an overwhelming vote. 
   I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   On December 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan, the commanders on the ground were Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short. Rear Admiral Kimmel was serving in the grade of admiral as commander in chief of the U.S. Fleet and commander in chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet. Major General Short was serving in the grade of lieutenant general as commander of the U.S. Army Hawaiian Department. Based on their performance at Pearl Harbor, both officers were relieved of their commands and were returned to their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general on December 16, 1941. 
   The duty performance of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short has been the subject of numerous military, governmental, and congressional inquiries since that time. The most recent examination was by Under Secretary of Defense Edwin Dorn in 1995. 
   The Defense Department, after reviewing all of these inquiries, has concluded that posthumous advancement in rank is not appropriate. In short, in this 1995 review, the Department of Defense concluded that Admiral Kimmel and General Short, as commanders on the scene, were responsible and accountable for the actions of their commands. Accountability as commanders is a core value in our Armed Forces. 
   Rear Admiral Kimmel's and Major General Short's superiors at the time determined that their service was not satisfactory and relieved them of their commands and returned them to their permanent grades. We should not, in my judgment, some 57 years later, substitute the judgment of a political body--the Congress--for what was essentially a military decision by the appropriate 
   chain of command at the time. 
   Those who were in the best position to characterize their service have done so. Their superiors concluded that Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short did not demonstrate the judgment required of people who serve at the three- and four-star level. I do not believe that this political body should now attempt to reverse that decision made by the chains of command in our military service. So I join the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in opposing this amendment. 
   I also note the letter from the Secretary of Defense to the then chairman of our committee, STROM THURMOND, saying the following:  
   While Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Mr. Edwin Dorn, conducted a thorough review of this issue in 1995. He carefully considered the information contained in nine previous formal investigations, visited Pearl Harbor and personally met with the Kimmel and Short families. His conclusion was that responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster must be broadly shared, but that the record does not show that advancement of Admiral Kimmel and General Short on the retired list is warranted. 
   I appreciate the fact that the overwhelming consensus of the organizations and personnel mentioned in your letter recommend exoneration of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. Absent significant new information, however, I do not believe it appropriate to order another review of this matter. 
   Ed Dorn and I both agree that responsibility for this tragic event in American history must be broadly shared, yet I remain confident in the findings that Admiral Kimmel and General Short remain accountable in their positions as leaders.  
   To highlight very briefly the findings of the Under Secretary of Defense in the Dorn report, referred to by the Secretary of Defense, I will quote three or four of the findings. 
   Finding 1:  
   Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.  
   Finding 2:  
   To say that responsibility is broadly shared is not to absolve Admiral Kimmel and General Short of accountability. 
   Military command is unique. A commander has plenary responsibility for the welfare of the people under his or her command, and is directly accountable for everything the unit does or fails to do....... Command at the three- and four-star level involves daunting responsibilities. Military officers at that level operate with a great deal of independence. They must have extraordinary skill, foresight and judgment, and a willingness to be accountable for things about which they could not possibly have personal knowledge....... 
   It was appropriate that Admiral Kimmel and General Short be relieved.  
   Then he goes into the information that he had. 
   I yield myself just 1 additional minute.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, finally in finding 3, the Dorn report says:  
   The official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.  
   Then finally:  
   There is not a compelling basis for advancing either officer to a higher grade. 
   Their superiors concluded that Admiral Kimmel and General Short did not demonstrate the judgment required of people who serve at the three- and four-star level. * * * * * 
   In sum, I cannot conclude that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were victims of unfair official actions and thus I cannot conclude that the official remedy of advancement on the retired list [is] in order.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just add to what the Senator from Virginia just said in response to our good friend from Delaware. What I really fear, perhaps the most, is the substitution of the judgment of a political body for the judgment and findings of the appropriate chain of command. We are a political body. The chain of command at the time, which has been reviewed by the Defense Department, repeatedly made findings and held these two officers accountable. For us now to substitute our judgment more than five decades later for that of the chain of command, it seems to me, is a very, very bad precedent in terms of holding officers accountable for events. 
   Mr. President, the Department of Defense recently reviewed this entire matter--the so-called Dorn report--and I have quoted these findings before, but I will pick out two of them, which seems to me go to the heart of the matter. 
   This is a quote:  
   To say that responsibility is broadly shared is not to absolve Admiral Kimmel and General Short of accountability.  
   Of course, accountability should be broadly shared, and maybe it wasn't as broadly shared as it should have been, but the issue is whether or not this accountability, 57 years ago, is going to be set aside by a political body 57 years later.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be voting for this amendment because it is worded very differently from earlier versions. This version of the amendment simply requires the President to certify whether or not the new Strategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment or obligation on the United States. 
   In 1991, we had major changes in the alliance's Strategic Concept. These were huge changes. Section 9 of the alliance's new Strategic Concept in 1991, for instance, said:  
   Risks to allied security are less likely to result from calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but rather from the adverse consequences of instabilities that may arise from serious economic, social and political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes which are faced by many countries in Central and Eastern Europe. They could lead to crises inimical to European stability and even to armed conflicts which could involve outside powers or spill over into NATO countries.  
   Then in paragraph 12, it says:  
   Alliance security must--  
   This is 1991--not this new one, but the Strategic Concept that was adopted in 1991.  
   Alliance security must take into account the global context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, disruption of the flow of vital resources, and actions of terrorism and sabotage.  
   The reason that this 1991 Strategic Concept was not sent over to the Senate for ratification was very straightforward, very simple, in my judgment; and that is that the Strategic Concept then did not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States. This is a strategic concept; this is not a legally binding document. This is not a treaty-specific document which contains obligations and commitments on the part of the parties. This is a strategic concept document, both in 1991 and in 1999. 
   So when my good friend from Kansas says that I said the Congress was asleep in 1991, the Congress was not asleep in 1991. The Congress was exactly right in 1991. When this Strategic Concept was adopted in 1991, there were no new obligations or commitments that required the Senate to ratify this document. And there are no new obligations or commitments now. 
   The President has already told us that. He has already sent a letter to Senator WARNER. The President has sent a letter to Senator WARNER dated April 14, 1999, that says:  
   The Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States.  
   So the certification, which is required in this amendment--and rightfully so, by the way, in my judgment--has already been made. I see no reason it would not be made again. 
   So I do not believe that the Congress was sleeping in 1991, and it surely is not sleeping now. Senator ROBERTS is, as far as I am concerned, very appropriately saying to the administration, if this contains new commitments or obligations--if it contains new obligations and commitments--then 
   you should send this to us as a treaty amendment. 
   Of course, I happen to think that is correct. This amendment does not find that there are new obligations and commitments. An earlier version of this amendment, by the way, did. This amendment does not do that. This amendment says to the President: Tell the Congress whether or not the new Strategic Concept--those are the precise words of this amendment--constitutes, involves, contains, new obligations or commitments.

   Mr. LEVIN. I think that is correct. The timing of the letter is exactly as the chairman says it is. But the statement of the President is that ``the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States.'' 
   The caption of the amendment by the Senator from Kansas is ``Relating to the legal effect of [this] new Strategic Concept.'' I think it is quite clear from our conversations with the State Department that the President can, indeed, and will, indeed, make this certification, and should--and should. I think it is an important certification. 
   I commend the Senator from Kansas. I think we need clarity on this subject. If there is a legally binding commitment on the United States in this new Strategic Concept, it ought to be sent to the Senate for ratification. But if this 1999 Strategic Concept is like the 1991 Strategic Concept--not a legally binding document but a planning document, a document setting out concepts, not legal obligations--that is a very different thing. 
   NATO has adopted strategic concepts continually during its existence. By the way, again, let me suggest there is nothing much broader than section 12 of the 1991 Strategic Concept which said: ``Alliance security must take into account the global context.'' Does that represent a binding commitment on the United States? It surely did not, in my judgment, and need not have been submitted to the Senate for ratification. I believe that the current Concept, which has been adopted, does not contain legally binding commitments.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I think it clearly means the legal effect of this. But let us, rather than arguing over what is in or not in this amendment--I understand that there was going to be an effort made here to clarify language on the certification. If there is going to be such an effort, I would ask that be made now and that we then ask for the yeas and nays so we are not shooting at a moving target here. Really, I think it would be useful, if in fact that change relative to the certification requirement is going to be sent to the desk, it be sent to the desk at this point; and then I am going to ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just 2 minutes. I read this document quite clearly as meaning any new commitment or obligation, because it uses the word ``impose.'' I know no other way to impose an obligation or a commitment other than legal. When you use the word ``impose,'' it seems to me it is quite clear that that means it is imposed. So that is the way I read this language. If others want to read the language in a different way, they may. But I think that the certification requirement, which the Senator from Kansas wants to move into the front of this amendment instead of in the sense-of-the-Senate part of it, is simply a clarification of what was always the clear intent, which is that there be such a certification. And I think that that is more of a technical change than anything. 
   I have no objection to an amendment which moves the certification requirement to the front of the amendment before the sense-of-the-Senate language and imposes that as a certification requirement--not sense of the Congress but as a requirement on the President. In my judgment, there is no doubt but that it is only if there is a legally binding commitment or obligation that this would require a referral to the U.S. Senate, because no other requirement or obligation other than one that is legally binding on us would rise to the dignity of a treaty. 
   I hope the Senator will have a chance to move the certification requirement to an earlier position in his amendment. If I could just ask one question of my friend from Kansas, as I understand, that is what the modification does provide and nothing more; is that correct?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment for the reasons previously given. It does not reach any conclusion as to whether there are any additional obligations upon the United States. Unlike earlier versions, it simply asks the President to certify whether or not there are additional obligations imposed on the United States. 
   I have read from what was called then the new Strategic Concept of NATO in 1991. At the heading of that Concept, it was stated that:  
   The alliance recognizes that developments taking place in Europe would have a far-reaching impact on the way in which its aims would be met in the future.  
   And, indeed, adopted language such as:  
   Alliance security must also take into account the global context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, disruption of flow of vital resources, actions of terrorism and sabotage.  
   That did not impose any new obligations. It is very broad language. 
   Listen to some of this language in this 1991 alliance new Strategic Concept:  
   The primary role of the alliance military forces to guarantee security and territorial integrity of member states remains unchanged [we said in 1991]. But this role must take account of the new strategic environment in which a single massive and global threat has given way to diverse and multidirectional risks. Allied forces have different functions to perform in peace, crises, and war.  
   That is section 40 in 1991. 
   How about this one, section 41:  
   Allies could be called upon to contribute to global stability and peace by providing forces for United Nations missions.  
   How about that for a mission in 1991? Did that impose an obligation on us, legal obligation on this body, or on this Nation? Boy, I hope not. Not in my book it did not.  
   Allies could be called upon to contribute to global stability and peace by providing forces for United Nations missions.  
   This was adopted in 1991 as a new Strategic Concept. That did not impose a thing on us. It was a new Strategic Concept adopted by NATO, not a legally binding commitment on the alliance. 
   It was not submitted to us then as a treaty change because it was not a treaty change, nor is this new Strategic Concept of 1999 legally binding upon us any more than the 1991 Strategic Concept was. 
   So I think we ought to adopt this amendment. It is something which is highly appropriate to ask the President whether or not the new Strategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment or obligation on the United States, the key word there to me being ``imposes.'' 
   I ask, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, that the yeas and nays be ordered on this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment. It says that the President should say to us whether or not the new Strategic Concept imposes new commitments or obligations upon us. It does not find that there are such new obligations or commitments. The President has already written to us in a letter to Senator WARNER that the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations. 
   In 1991, the new Strategic Concept, which came with much new language and many new missions, was not submitted to the Senate. Indeed, much of the language is very similar in 1991 as in 1999. 
   In my judgment, there are no new commitments or obligations imposed by the 1999 Strategic Concept. The President could very readily certify what is required that he certify by this amendment, and I support it.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. It would send the worst possible signal, I believe, to Milosevic at this time. A kind of ``don't worry'' signal, if you weather the storm, no matter how weakened your military is, the President isn't going to be able to go in even in a semipermissive environment in order to return the refugees, because Congress has tied his hands, tied the purse to say that only if Congress affirmatively approves the expenditure of funds, then and only then could ground forces go in, even in a semipermissive environment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   I can't think of a worse signal to send to Milosevic in the middle of a conflict than this amendment would send to him. Congressional gridlock is not unheard of around here. We have plenty of examples of Congress being unable to act. We had a recent example  in the House where the House could not even agree to support an air campaign that is presently going on, a tie vote. 
   Under this funding cutoff approach, that air campaign presumably would not be able to continue under a comparable resolution applying to the use of military forces. 
   I know this only applies to ground forces and not to an air campaign, but that vote in the House of Representatives is a wonderful example of how Milosevic, when he looked at this resolution, would say, well, gee, this would require Congress to affirmatively act, and since the House can't even get a majority to act to support an ongoing operation, I could comfortably rely, he would say to himself, on the fact that they would never authorize in advance a ground campaign, even in a semipermissive environment. 
   The President has been criticized for taking the possibility of ground troops off the table. The argument is that Milosevic doesn't have to worry as much about that possibility, given the position of the administration. I think we ought to want Milosevic to worry and to worry more, not less. This is a ``worry less'' amendment, not a ``worry more'' amendment. This says Congress would have to affirmatively approve ground forces in advance, even in a semipermissive environment, and it seems to me Milosevic could quite comfortably say to himself that is not a very strong likelihood. 
   There are a lot of practical problems with the wording of this amendment. For instance, what happens if U.S. intelligence discovered that American forces in Albania or in Macedonia were about to be attacked by Yugoslav army forces and it was determined to be necessary for U.S. ground forces to conduct a preemptive attack into Kosovo in self-defense? We are just about ready to be attacked; can we hit the attacker? Not under this amendment. You have to come to Congress first. 
   Our military would be told, whoops, you are about to be attacked in Albania or Macedonia, but Congress passed a law saying they have to authorize the use of ground forces. Do we want to tie the hands of our commanders that way in the middle of a conflict, to tell our commanders that even in circumstances where they think they are about to be hit that they cannot preemptively go after the attackers in Kosovo with ground forces? They have to then just take it on the chin? 
   And what if U.S. forces in Albania or Macedonia were attacked by Yugoslav army forces, actually attacked in Macedonia or Albania. Would counterattacking U.S. forces have to stop at the Kosovo border, thereby giving the Yugoslav army a haven from which they could conduct ground attacks across the border but not be pursued by American ground forces? The commander would have to stop at the border and come to Congress? 
   So it is the worst kind of signal we could give in the middle of a conflict to Mr. Milosevic, and it creates burdens on our commanders that are intolerable in the middle of a conflict. 
   We have been advised by the Department of Defense on this amendment that ``it is so restrictive of U.S. operations and so injurious to our role in the alliance that the President's senior advisers would strongly recommend that the final bill be vetoed if this language is included in the bill.'' That is information we have just received from the Department of Defense. 
   Gridlock. Fifty votes in the House. Now, under this amendment, we have to affirmatively approve something. What happens if a majority of us want to approve it but we are filibustered? The Senator from Pennsylvania said, well, those are the rules. 
   Those are the rules. But under his amendment, it would mean that even if a majority of the Senate wanted to give approval to ground forces, a minority in the Senate could thwart that action. 
   I think this is the kind of tying of our hands in the middle of a conflict that would tell Milosevic this country is not serious about the NATO mission. This NATO mission is so critical in terms of the future of Europe; it is so critical in terms of the stability not only of Europe but of the North Atlantic community that for us to adopt language that in advance says you can't do something without Congress acting, knowing, as we do, how difficult it is to get Congress to act even in the middle of a conflict, would be simply a terrible result for the success of our mission. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 3 minutes.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we want, I hope, to do two things. One is to tell the President, as we have, how important it is that there be consultation and that he seek support from the Congress, and he has committed to do so. But that is a very different thing from what this amendment provides. This is an advance funding cutoff, unless something happens that can be thwarted by gridlock. 
   We should not ever forget the likelihood of gridlock in this Congress. Even if a majority wanted to support the use of ground forces in a nonpermissive environment, a minority of the Senate could thwart that majority view. I believe the signal to Milosevic that he will be the beneficiary of gridlock, and only if gridlock can be overcome would he then have to fear the possibility of the use of ground forces, is a signal that would undermine the current mission in a very significant way. 
   Again, reading from the information paper the Department of Defense has shared with us this afternoon:  
   The Department strongly opposes this amendment because it would unacceptably put at risk the lives of U.S. and NATO military personnel, jeopardize the success of Operation Allied Force, and inappropriately restrict the President's options as Commander in Chief.  
   These are now the words of the information paper shared with us by the Department:  
   ..... effectively give Milosevic advance notice of ground action by NATO forces, should NATO commanders request consideration of this option.  
   While we have made no decision to use ground forces in a nonpermissive environment, it would be a mistake to hamstring this option with a legislative requirement for prior 
   congressional approval. The Department says:  
   This would be construed to prohibit certain intelligence or reconnaissance operations essential to a successful prosecution of Operation Allied Force. It would prohibit any preemptive attack by U.S. forces based on advance warning or suspicion of an impending attack by the Yugoslav forces. It would prohibit U.S. ground personnel from pursuing those forces, conducting hit and run, or similar attacks across international boundaries.  
   But the words that we should pay the most heed to in this memorandum from the Department of Defense--the words that I hope this Senate will think very carefully about before we consider adopting this amendment--are that the Department strongly opposes amendment No. 383 because it would ``unacceptably put at risk the lives of U.S. and NATO military personnel and jeopardize the success of Operation Allied Force.''

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, section 806 of the defense authorization bill which is before the Senate is a commonsense provision. It was adopted by the Armed Services Committee. Basically, it says the private sector ought to be allowed to bid on items that the Department of Defense is buying, if the Department of Defense declares that it is necessary that the private sector be allowed to bid. 
   That may sound so obvious that people may be scratching their heads saying, well, obviously the private sector ought to be allowed to bid if the Department of Defense believes the product which is offered by the private sector is what is needed by the Department of Defense. But that is not the way it is now. The way it is now is that Federal Prison Industries can make a unilateral decision that it is going to supply the Department of Defense with a product, and the private business people out there who want to just simply compete for a product can be prohibited from doing so. That, it seems to me, is the height of unfairness in a society which has a private sector, has private businesses, has labor that is working in those private businesses, and where a Government agency says that product, produced by that private company, is a product that we want because it is a better product than FPI can give us or it is a product that can be given to us more cheaply than the prisons can give it to us. 
   What an extraordinary way it is to run a Government, that we have agencies in this Government that want to buy a product, be it textiles or furniture or what have you, that are told they cannot compete that product with the private sector competing; they have to buy it from Federal Prison Industries even though it costs the agency more or it is of lower quality. What an extraordinary way to be inefficient, to waste taxpayers' money, and to force agencies that are supposed to be protecting taxpayers' money to spend it on lesser quality items or on more expensive items--just because Federal Prison Industries unilaterally has decided it is going to supply the Department of Defense. That is not fair. That is not fair and we have to eliminate it. 
   Section 806 simply says that the Department of Defense--not Federal Prison Industries--should determine whether or not a product manufactured by Federal Prison Industries meets the needs of the Department of Defense. 
   The approach that is taken by Section 806 is consistent with the basic tenet of how our whole procurement system works, which is the people who buy and use products should be the ones who decide whether the quality, price, and delivery of those products meet their needs. Yet amazingly enough, the FPI, Federal Prison Industries' current rules prohibit Federal agencies from even looking at private sector products to determine whether they might be superior to what Federal Prison Industries has. 
   The regulations of Federal Prison Industries say:  
   A contracting activity should not solicit bids, proposals, quotations or otherwise test the market for the purpose of seeking alternative sources to the Federal Prison Industries.   
   If that is not absolutely extraordinary, that Federal Prison Industries is telling the Department of Defense, when they go and buy textiles or shoes or whatever they are buying, that they may not even test the market, seeking alternative sources to Federal Prison Industries. 
   They may not solicit bids, proposals, quotations, or test the market for the purpose of seeking alternative sources to Federal Prison Industries. 
   What kind of an upside-down situation is this? What kind of a topsy-turvy situation is it that the Department of Defense cannot even solicit a quote from somebody to supply a product if Federal Prison Industries says they may not do so? Unilaterally, the seller is telling the buyer: You can't even go out and seek other quotes or seek competition. 
   Boy, that sure turns the purchasing process of the Department of Defense and our other agencies right on its head. 
   What the Department of Defense is required to do, instead of doing what ordinary buyers do, which is to seek the best product at the best price, is to accept Federal Prison Industries' determination. Federal Prison Industries is the sole arbiter of whether its products meet the requirements of the Department of Defense. 
   Section 8104 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act requires the Department of Defense and other agencies to conduct market research before soliciting bids or proposals for products that may be available in the commercial marketplace. They are supposed to solicit bids, but they do not do that. They are not allowed to do that. Under the FPI rules, they have to buy it from Federal Prison Industries if the Industries on their own, unilaterally, decide they are going to force the Department of Defense to buy a product. 
   All that the provision does is to reverse the rule which prohibits the Department of Defense from conducting market research and permits the Department of Defense to look at what private sector companies have to offer, as it would do in the case of any other procurement. 
   If Federal Prison Industries offers a product that is comparable in price, quality, and time of delivery to products available from the private sector, the Department would still be required to purchase that product on a sole-source basis from Federal Prison Industries. But if the DOD determines that Federal Prison Industries' product was not competitive, then it would be permitted to conduct a competition and go to another source. 
   That seems to me to be the least that we can do to protect the taxpayers from the misuse of Federal funds on products that fail to meet the needs of the Department of Defense. 
   Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that it provides quality products at a price that is competitive with current market prices. The statute, indeed, is intended to do exactly that, provided Federal Prison Industries will provide the Federal agencies products that meet their requirements and prices that do not exceed current market prices. But the FPI is unwilling to permit agencies to compare their products at prices with those available in the private sector. 
   Under Federal Prison Industries' current interpretation of the law, it need not offer the best product at the best price. It is sufficient for it to offer an adequate product at an adequate price and insist on its right to make the sale. When Federal Prison Industries sets the price, it then seeks to charge what it calls a market price, which means that at least some vendors in the private sector charge a higher price, and the FPI's proposed regulation specifies that the determination of what constitutes the current market price, the methodology employed to determine the current market price and the 
   conclusion that a product of Federal Prison Industries does not exceed that price is--you got it--the sole responsibility of Federal Prison Industries. 
   That is the situation. They are supposed to buy at market price, but they make a determination as to whether or not, in fact, what they are forcing an agency to buy is being set at a market price. 
   The General Accounting Office reported in August of 1998:  
   The only limit the law imposes on Federal Prison Industries' price is that it may not exceed the upper end--  
   Upper end--  
   of the current market price range.  
   Moreover, the manner in which Federal Prison Industries seeks to establish the current market price range appears calculated to result in a price far higher than the Department of Defense would pay under any other circumstances. According to the proposed regulation codifying FPI's pricing policies, ``a review of commercial catalog prices will be used to establish a `range' for current market price.'' 
   The contrast is very sharp because when the Department of Defense buys from commercial vendors, it seeks to negotiate, and generally obtains, a steep discount from catalog prices. 
   FPI appears to have difficulty even matching the undiscounted catalog prices. Last August, the General Accounting Office compared Federal Prison Industries' prices for 20 representative products to private vendors' catalog prices for the same or comparable products and found that for four of these products, FPI's price was higher than the price offered by any private vendor. That is 4 out of 20. In 4 out of 20 cases, GAO found that the price FPI charged was higher than the price offered by any private vendor. For five of the remaining products, the FPI price was at the ``high end of the range.'' Those are the words of the General Accounting Office. FPI's price was at the ``high end of the range'' of prices offered by private vendors--ranking sixth, seventh, seventh, eighth, and ninth of the 10 vendors reviewed. In other words, for almost half of the FPI products reviewed, the FPI approach appeared to be to charge the highest price possible rather than the lowest price possible to the Federal consumer. 
   We have complaint after complaint from frustrated private sector vendors asking us: Why can't we compete? Why are we in the private sector precluded from bidding on an item? 
   Here is one vendor's letter:  
   Federal Prison Industries bid on this item, and simply because Federal Prison Industries did, it had to be given to Federal Prison Industries. FPI won the bid at $45 per unit. My company bid $22 per unit. The way I see it, the Government just overspent my tax dollars to the tune of $1,978. Do you seriously believe that this type of procurement is cost-effective? I lost business, my tax dollars were misused because of unfair procurement practices mandated by Federal regulations. This is a prime example, and I'm certain not the only one, of how the procurement system is being misused and small businesses in this country are being excluded from competition with the full support of Federal regulations and the seeming approval of Congress. 
 It is far past time.......to require [FPI] to be competitive for the benefit of all taxpayers. 
   A third frustrated vendor, who had been driven out of business by FPI, told a House committee:  
   Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who was twice wounded fighting for our country.......therefore effectively destroying and bankrupting that.......business which the Veterans' Administration suggested he enter?  
   There is a very fundamental unfairness which exists in this system. It is one that we need to correct. The Department of Defense took a survey recently of DOD customers for Federal Prison Industries' products. The results are eye-opening. The survey provided DOD customers five categories in which to rate Federal Prison Industries' products: excellent, good, average, fair, or poor. 
   According to the data reported jointly by the Department of Defense and the Federal Prison Industries in April, a majority of Department of Defense customers rated FPI as average, fair, or poor in price, delivery, and as an overall supplier. 
   On price: 54 percent of the Department of Defense's electronics customers, 70 percent of DOD clothing and textile customers, 46 percent of DOD dorm and quarters furniture customers, 53 percent of DOD office case goods customers, 57 percent of DOD systems furniture customers rated FPI prices as average, fair, or poor. 
   On delivery, the same kind of figures: 50 percent of DOD electronics customers rated FPI delivery as averaged, fair, or poor; 62 percent of DOD clothing and textile customers rated FPI delivery as average, fair, or poor. That did not make any difference. FPI said it was going to sell, and once FPI made  that determination, the Department had no alternative. It does not make any difference whether the delivery is lousy, whether the price is too high, whether the overall performance is poor. It makes no difference. Forget competition. FPI said: We are going to sell. Forget fairness to a business with workers in that business. FPI said: Tough. You have to buy from us. 
   So the bottom line is that fully 35 percent of the Department of Defense customers indicated they have had a problem with an FPI product delivered in the last 12 months. The reason they are having problems is because there is a lack of competition. 
   We think, given the fact that such a small amount of money is paid to prisoners for their labor, that Federal Prison Industries could supply these products much more cheaply than the private sector. But that is not the case. The case is that the private sector very often can supply these products to our agencies more cheaply than can the prison industries. But if the Federal Prison Industries decides in its unilateral, sole, exclusive judgment that it is going to supply the Department of Defense, that is it. That is it. This is an injustice to the people who have worked hard to put together a business. It is an injustice to the people who work for those businesses. 
   This is one of those weird cases where you have business and labor coming together before us on the same side of an issue. The American Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, urges that this section remain in the bill. We have the alert from the Chamber of Commerce as well. Members of the Senate, business and labor--our good friend from Texas calls those special 
   interests, business and labor. People who have worked hard to put together a business and people who work in those businesses are not being allowed to compete. Sorry. Federal Prison Industries says you are going to buy that product. That is what they tell the DOD. You are going to buy it. You may not like the price, you may not like the delivery, you may not like the quality, but we are not going to let anybody else compete for that sale. 
   So that is the fundamental unfairness that this language would correct. It does not tell the Department of Defense they cannot buy it from Federal Prison Industries. It simply says that if the Department of Defense determines on price or quality that the private sector can do as well, then it--not the FPI; the Department of Defense--may compete and determine whether or not they can save the taxpayers any money. 
   I am going to close and then turn this over to my friend and my colleague from Michigan for his comments. But I just want to read one additional quote from the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy before the National Security Committee of the House a couple years ago. He said that the FPI monopoly on Government furniture contracts has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its sailors. 
   Master Chief Petty Officer John Hagan said:  
   Speaking frankly, the [FPI] product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. [The Federal Prison Industries] has, in my opinion, exploited their special status instead of making changes which would make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need your support to change the law and have FPI compete with [private sector] furniture manufacturers. Without this change, we will not be serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and efficient way.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I am happy to yield time to my distinguished colleague from Michigan.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the language in the bill that the Senator from Texas seeks to strike makes it possible for the private sector to compete. That sounds so fundamental in our country that maybe it comes as a shock that I would even suggest that you need to have language in a bill to permit the private sector to do this. But we do. 
   We just want to make it legal for the private sector to offer a product to its Government, our Government, and not to have Federal Prison Industries say: Sorry, you cannot bid. It is almost bizarre to me that we would have to pass any kind of legislation for that to come about, but we do because under the current law and regulations, Federal Prison Industries has the sole, exclusive determining voice. If it says that its product is within a range in the market--maybe at the high end of that range, and they may be wrong--but once FPI says that, that is it; private business cannot compete. 
   In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, David Oliver, described the results of the survey we referred to. 
   He said the following:  
   I think if you looked at the study, you would see that people were generally not satisfied with Federal Prison Industries as a provider. Essentially, with regard to efficiency, timeliness, and best value, they found that Federal Prison Industries was worse than the other people they bought from.  
   Now, we know that the administration has decided to oppose 
   this change, to prohibit the private sector from bidding on things that Federal Prison Industries says it wants to supply exclusively. So we understand what the Department of Defense's official position is. But I also understand what the testimony of their acquisition people is. The study shows that people were generally not satisfied with Federal Prison Industries as a provider with regard to efficiency, timeliness, and best value. They found that Federal Prison Industries was worse than the other people they bought from. 
   I don't believe for one minute that Federal Prison Industries is going to be able to sell anything to the Department of Defense just because they are going to have to compete. They have such a huge advantage in terms of cost and price of labor that they are going to be able to sell a huge amount. But they are going to have to compete. 
   If a private company can outbid them or provide the same product at a cheaper price, then the private company is going to get it. But for the Senator from Texas to say, suddenly, that wipes out all of the sales to the Department of Defense, that is a terrible indictment about what Federal Prison Industries is now doing. That would mean they can't compete on anything they are selling to the Department of Defense. That is a huge exaggeration. It is not the case. 
   But it is the case that now they don't have to compete when they decide that the Department of Defense must buy that missile part. If Federal Prison Industries says the Department of Defense must buy that missile part Senator WARNER referred to, that has to happen--even though a private contractor can sell a better quality at a better price. Once FPI, in its unilateral judgment, says we can supply it within a price range of what the private sector can do, that is it, no competition. DOD can't bid it out--the opposite of what we should be doing in this free enterprise society of ours. 
   Mr. President, I hope the language in the Senate bill will be retained and that the amendment of the Senator from Texas to strike that language will be defeated. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment would send the worst possible signal to Milosevic, which is don't worry, weather the storm--that even though there is going to be gridlock in the Congress, you will be the beneficiary of any gridlock and any effort that authorizes in advance the use of ground forces. This is not the message which we should be sending to Milosevic--that he would be the beneficiary of the congressional gridlock, which would almost certainly occur before any such resolutions could be passed. 
   I hope we will not send that signal to Milosevic. I think our troops deserve better. Our commanders deserve better. 
   The administration believes so strongly in this that a veto would almost certainly occur, if this provision were in, and understandably so, because the hands of our commanders in the field would be tied by this resolution. They would have to come to Congress to see whether or not the terms were met. That is not the way to fight either a war or to engage in combat.

   Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Virginia said how much confidence he has in the Secretary of Defense. Is the Senator suggesting that the Secretary of Defense is going to stand by while some political person from somewhere reaches around him into the bowels of the Pentagon to give a signal that some base should not be considered? 
   It is because our good friend from Virginia did not want there to be any possibility of any political involvement by anybody that we delayed the date for the Secretary of Defense to transmit the base closure recommendations to September 1, 2002. 
   The new President and the new Secretary of Defense--or the current one, if he is continued--will have until September 1 to transmit the base closure recommendation. We delayed it 6 months because the Senator, in committee, said he was concerned that the preliminary work could be done now and somehow or other, unbeknownst to an honest Secretary of Defense--who I think our good friend would concede is an honest one----

   Mr. LEVIN. This work would begin and somehow or other it would take hold. 
   So we delayed the transmittal to September 1 of the year after the new President is elected, 6 months--more than that, 8 months after the new President is in office. 
   It seems to me at this point that the argument about politicization is now being used as an excuse not to act. We have done everything we possibly can to eliminate any possibility of that. The new President is not required to transmit names for a base closure commission. As the good Senator from Virginia knows, if the new President does not want a base closing round, he or she need not have it. That is the law. All the new President has to do is not nominate anybody. 
   So you have total control in the new President. You have 9 months to submit the recommendations. At this point, the politicization argument, it seems to me--talking about reaching down? I think the good Senator, my good friend, is reaching back.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing S. 1059 to the floor. This is our fiscal year 2000 defense authorization bill. It is the product of many months of hard work by the committee under the leadership of our new chairman, Senator WARNER, who has taken the baton from Senator THURMOND, who had done an extraordinary job. Senator THURMOND, who is on the floor, was chairman of our committee for many years. This year he turned that responsibility over to Senator WARNER, and Senator WARNER has carried on with great strength and great commitment that is in keeping with the leadership Senator THURMOND showed when he was chairman of this committee. I commend Senator WARNER for carrying on that tradition of Senator THURMOND and, indeed, those before Senator THURMOND. 
   As Senator WARNER has pointed out, our staffs have been instrumental in helping us bring this bill to the floor. We had a unanimous vote for this bill in committee. I think that is a real testament to the chairman's leadership. I commend him for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that is a view I fully share. 
   The bill we bring to the floor is a sound bill that goes a long way to meet the priorities which have been established by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is brought to the floor based on a very sound foundation because General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has assured us, assured the committee, assured the Congress, and assured the Nation our Armed Forces are fundamentally sound and fundamentally capable of fulfilling their role in our national military strategy. So we start with that sound foundation. Obviously, there are some places where we have to put some additional resources. But the foundation is a sound one and the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs has assured us of that. 
   So, what we seek to do in this bill is build on that sound foundation. I believe we have done so. In accordance with the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution, the bill includes an $8 billion increase in budget authority above the level provided in the President's budget. 
   Unlike some of the budget increases in the past years, the added money in this bill will be spent in a much more responsible way than we have sometimes done in the past, because the money we have added this year is entirely spent for programs for which the Department of Defense has indicated a real need. The bottom line is, this bill will improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform. It will improve the readiness of our military. It will continue the process of modernizing our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the future. 
   Virtually all the items for which the committee added funding were taken from either the Services' unfunded priority list for fiscal year 2000 or from the outyears of the future years' defense program, the so-called FYDP, which we deal with 
   in the Armed Services Committee. These add-ons include substantial increases for the highest priority readiness items identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including an added $554 million for real property maintenance, $420 million for base operations, $120 million for ammunition, $73 million for spare parts, $60 million for reserve component training, $40 million for depot maintenance. This money will significantly enhance the ability of our Armed Forces to carry out their full range of missions. 
   These are areas where we sometimes fall short. These are not the most glamorous areas. They do not have a lot of people lobbying for them. But they are critically important areas--real property maintenance, base operation, spare parts, reserve component training, depot maintenance. 
   In addition, the bill includes the triad of pay and retirement initiatives sought by Secretary Cohen and by the Joint Chiefs--a 4.8-percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2000, reform of the military pay table to increase pay for midcareer NCOs and officers, and changes to the military retirement system. These changes will, hopefully, help address recruiting and retention problems we have in the services. 
   When S. 4 was considered on the Senate floor, we indicated then we wanted to do everything we could to ensure the men and women in uniform received fair compensation for the service they provide to our country. At that time, I expressed concern about proceeding with the pay bill outside the context of the defense authorization bill and before Congress had passed a budget resolution. We have now revisited this issue in the context of the budget resolution and the authorization bill. I am pleased to report the changes in military pay and benefits proposed in this bill are all paid for. 
   Unfortunately, the committee has not yet been able to find a way to fund one of the most important aspects of S. 4, and that aspect is Senator CLELAND's proposals to enhance the GI bill, which is so important in providing educational opportunities to the men and women in our Armed Forces. These provisions, Senator CLELAND's proposal, would provide substantial incentives to help address the current recruiting and retention problems which face the military services while offering our men and women in uniform an educational opportunity in the proudest tradition of our country. I expect Senator CLELAND will raise this issue again as we debate the bill on the floor. 
   I sincerely hope we will find a way to adopt these proposals. They are very important proposals. They are important to the retention we need to enhance. They would be important even if there were not a retention problem, in terms of opportunities we should offer to the men and women in our Armed Forces. 
   The bill reported by the committee also provides full funding for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program with Russia and with other countries of the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, two of the three companion programs at the Department of Energy received substantially less funding than requested by the administration. The bill also contains some unfortunate restrictions on the DOE Nuclear Cities Program, which I hope we will be able to address on the Senate floor. 
   The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the related Department of Energy programs are one positive cornerstone of our relationship with Russia. They play a vital role in our national security by reducing the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from Russia and  from rogue nations with which Russia might be pressured to form closer ties in the absence of these programs. 
   One area where I am most disappointed with the outcome of the markup is base closures, and our chairman has made reference to this issue.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as our chairman indicated, the committee spent a great deal of time addressing security concerns at the Department of Energy. The revelations of Chinese espionage directed at the DOE nuclear weapons program underscore 20 years of failure by the FBI and the Department of Energy, over the course of three administrations, to take adequate steps to address security problems in the Laboratories. 
   This problem has been ongoing for 20 years, through three administrations, and we have not seen, until a Presidential decision directive last year, an effort to significantly tighten security at the Laboratories. 
   We have in that Presidential decision directive, which is called PDD-61, a strong effort by this administration to tighten that security. What we do in this bill is to build on that effort, and we do so in a way which does not undermine the ability of the Department of Energy to perform its vital national security function. 
   I commend our chairman for his leadership in this effort. It is important that we do strengthen the security at the Department of Energy. It is important that we take the effort which finally was made when this administration signed a Presidential decision directive, and the President did so, but that we build additional safeguards which need to be in law. 
   Here is what we have done. We have written much of that Presidential decision directive into law. We have established an outside Commission on Safeguards, Security and Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy facilities. We have required a certification of the security aspects of the lab-to-lab and foreign visitors programs from the Secretary of Energy, the Director of the CIA, and the Director of the FBI. 
   The bill reported by our committee includes many other important provisions which will contribute to the national security and the effective management of the Department of Defense. Some of these provisions are: a provision establishing a single account for all Department of Defense funds to combat terrorism, both at home and abroad; a series of provisions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care provided to service men and women under the TriCare Program; a provision promoting reform of Department of Defense financial management systems; a series of provisions promoting more effective management of defense laboratories and test and evaluation facilities; a provision extending the Department's mentor-protege program for small disadvantaged businesses. 
   I conclude by, again, thanking our new chairman, Senator WARNER, for the manner in which he and his staff have handled this bill. He has maintained a great tradition of this committee, working with all members to make sure that all voices are heard in the effort which will always be needed to protect the Nation's security. 
   I know there is going to be vigorous debate on some provisions of this bill. We hope that Senators will, indeed, come to the floor and offer their amendments so that we can complete Senate action on the bill in a timely manner and go to conference. 
   But whatever the outcome of the debate on specific amendments or the vehemence of that debate, I think I can say unequivocally that our chairman, following in the footsteps of Senator THURMOND, has done so with tremendous strength and has, in doing so, enhanced the security of this Nation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I commend our good friend from Kansas for the energy he has put into a very significant issue which has to do with the new Strategic Concept of NATO. 
   This is not a new issue. The question of NATO's role since the fall of the Soviet Union has been an issue of a number of new Strategic Concepts. Listen to what NATO said in 1990. We have heard a lot about 1999 in Washington, but just listen to the heads of state in July 1990, speaking in London. Here is what the heads of state said: While reaffirming the basic principles on which the alliance has rested since its inception, they recognized the developments taking place in Europe would have a far-reaching impact on the way in which its aims would be met in the future and the need for a fundamental strategic review, fundamental strategic review. 
   And what came out of that strategic review in 1991, fundamental strategic review for NATO? They have listed many new security challenges and risks in 1991. Listen to risk No. 9, language very similar to what was adopted in Washington this year:  
   Risks to allied security less likely to result from calculated aggression against a territory of the allies but, rather, from adverse consequences of instabilities that may arise from the serious economic, social and political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes, which are faced by many countries in central and eastern Europe. The tensions which may result, as long as they remain limited, should not directly threaten the security and territorial integrity of the members of the alliance. They could, however, lead to crises inimical to European stability and even to armed conflicts, which could involve outside powers or spill over into NATO countries, having a direct effect on the security of the alliance.  
   Does it sound familiar? It sure does to me. It sounds like 1999 to me.  
   Risks to allied security are less likely to result from calculated aggression against a territory of allies but, rather, from the adverse consequences of instabilities that may arise from the serious economic, social and political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes..... .  
   I didn't hear too many calls then for a submission of amendments to the NATO treaty. I don't think we heard any calls then, although the risks changed. They changed in a significant way: No longer likely to come from calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but from adverse consequences of instabilities. 
   I don't think there was a change to the NATO treaty then, and I don't think there is a change to the NATO treaty now. There were no new commitments or obligations for the United States then, in 1991, nor do I believe there are any now. 
   Are there different challenges? Yes. Is there a different strategic concept? Yes. Are there different risks? Yes. But is there a change to the treaty, new commitments or obligations for the United States now? I don't think so. Were there in 1991 when all the allies signed a new strategic concept? No. Even though the Soviet military capability still was constituting the most significant factor, all of a sudden because of the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, we now had new risks. Listen to these words in paragraph 12. This is the 1991 Strategic Concept, paragraph 12:  
   Alliance security must also take account of the global context.   
   Wow. You talk about a different challenge and you talk about a new strategic concept. In 1991, the NATO allies suddenly say that alliance security must take account of the global context. Those are pretty broad words. But I didn't hear any suggestion back in 1991 that it was an amendment to the NATO treaty that required submission to the Senate--and for a good reason. There were no commitments or obligations undertaken in 1991, and there are no strategic concepts which contain new commitments or obligations in 1999. In 1999, the allies said that alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, disruption of the flow of vital resources, and actions of terrorism and sabotage. That is a lot different from an attack on the territory of the allies. But nobody suggested in 1991 that was an amendment to the NATO treaty, to the Washington Treaty. 
   Why didn't anyone suggest that in 1991? Because that did not constitute the undertaking of new commitments or obligations for the United States, even though we all agreed that alliance security must take into account the global context--and that is a lot beyond Europe. In 1991, everyone agreed to that. I don't remember one amendment, not one amendment, not one proposal that suggested that the new Strategic Concept constituted a commitment or obligation binding upon the United States which would require a change in the NATO treaty. It wasn't suggested in 1991 because there was no new commitment or undertaking binding upon us, because there was simply a new strategic concept. The 1999 Strategic Concept does not constitute a new commitment or obligation, either. The same principle applies now as applied then. 
   So the amendment of the Senator, which says if there are new undertakings, whether or not the new Strategic Concept imposes any new commitments or obligations on the United States, it seems to me is a requirement on the President that is perfectly appropriate. I have no difficulty whatsoever in asking the President to tell us whether or not the 1999 Strategic Concept represents new commitments or undertakings. It is perfectly appropriate--as this resolution does--to call on the President to inform us as to whether or not there are new commitments or undertakings. 
   As a matter of fact, the President has already informed us of exactly what this resolution says he should inform us. The President wrote Senator WARNER on April 14 that ``the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the 
   United States.'' Those are the President's words. 
   So what this resolution does is say: Does it? The President said, in April, that it won't. I have no doubt that the President will reaffirm that it didn't. But I must say I don't have a difficulty with what Senator ROBERTS is doing because it is perfectly appropriate to ask the President: Is there anything in this new Strategic Concept which imposes on us a new obligation for commitment? If so, submit it to us as a treaty amendment. 
   This is very different from some earlier language that was circulated in the Armed Services Committee. This doesn't make a finding that there are new commitments or obligations in this agreement in Washington in 1999. The language before us doesn't make any such finding. The language before us in the Senator's resolution, which I find to be appropriate, requires the President to determine and certify whether or not the Strategic Concept imposes any new commitment or obligations on the United States--whether or not. 
   And so as I read this resolution, I think the language is appropriate in this resolution, that the President reaffirm what he told us on April 14, tell us if there is any change in his thinking on that. Again, as he wrote Senator WARNER on April 14--and this letter has been made part of the RECORD now, I believe--the President said:  
   The Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States, but rather will underscore NATO's enduring purposes, outlined in the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty.  
   There has been reference here to the significance of changes in strategic concepts, and I think it is important that the Senate spend some time doing what Senator ROBERTS and others have done, both on the committee and off, in focusing on this Strategic Concept. It is important that we understand what these new threats and risks are. It is important, in my judgment, that we make a determination as to whether or not we do have new legal commitments and obligations. 
   I don't believe the 1999 Strategic Concept creates any new binding obligations or commitments any more than I did that the 1991 Strategic Concept created any new binding commitments and obligations. But our committees of jurisdiction surely should focus on that resolution. 
   Senator WARNER has indicated in the last few minutes that the Armed Services Committee will, indeed, be holding a series of hearings on this subject. As he stated it, if I heard him correctly, those hearings will occur after the events in Kosovo are resolved. But as of this time, we have not yet had such hearings. I am not certain of this. But I don't believe that the Foreign Relations Committee has either, at least after the Washington agreement was signed. There may have been a hearing before the Washington agreement. But I don't believe there has been one since it was signed. The agreement has some very significant provisions in it relative to a European commitment to take on greater responsibility for European defense. 
   Senator WARNER made reference to the European Security and Defense Initiative, a very significant change--a very significant initiative in terms of what Europe will do. It is something that I have believed for some time that Europe should do. The reference is very specific inside of the Washington agreement. 
   Two, the European allies taking on--in the words of the agreement--``assuming greater responsibility in the security and defense field in order to enhance the peace and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area, and, thus, the security of all allies.'' 
   Then it goes on to say: ``On the basis of decisions taken by the Alliance in Berlin in 1996 and subsequently, the European Security and Defense Initiative will continue to be developed within NATO.'' 
   I think it is a very significant change. It is something which we in the United States should welcome. It means that the Europeans will be taking on greater responsibility for the defense of Europe against threats, old and new. 
   We ought to welcome as well the reference or the discussion of a new initiative where European countries will have greater defense capability; capabilities to address appropriately and effectively the risks that are associated with weapons of mass destruction; new capabilities so that they can deploy more readily greater mobility, greater survivability of forces, greater infrastructure and sustainability. These are initiatives inside of the new strategic doctrine which will make it possible for Europe to take greater responsibility for the defense of Europe. We should welcome this. 
   I don't think there has been very much emphasis in the United States on what Europe has agreed to do in the new Strategic Concept--what they have, in effect, put into black and white, the commitment to greater European resources being used for the European defense. 
   As I said a few moments ago, this resolution which is before us says that if there are new commitments and obligations--if--then the President should so certify to the Senate. And I believe there is none. 
   Indeed, the Senator from Virginia has been assured by the President in the letter which he put in the RECORD that the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations. I believe there is none in this 1999 Strategic Concept, and I believe there was none in the 1991 Strategic Concept. There was none in 1991. 
   Even though the language is very similar--again, my good friend from Virginia being here--I just want to read some of the language in the 1991 Strategic Concept again. I will be very brief. But article 12 of the 1991 Strategic Concept said that ``alliance security must also take account the global concepts''--``global concepts.'' ``Alliance security interests can be affected  by other risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, disruption of the flow of vital resources and actions of terrorists and sabotage.'' 
   That was in 1991. That is just one part of a Strategic Concept which we all agreed to. 
   Did that represent changes in the North Atlantic Treaty? No, it did not, in my judgment. Nobody suggests that it did back then. No one suggested that the President back then, President Bush, submit that kind of change in strategic concept to the Senate as a change in the treaty, for a very good reason: It did not constitute a legal obligation or commitment which represented a change in the North Atlantic Treaty. That is why nobody proposed back then that we have to ratify this. 
   Those are broad words in here, section 9 of the 1991 new Strategic Concept--it was called new Strategic Concept 1991:  
   Risks to allied security are less likely to result from calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but rather from the adverse consequences of instabilities that may arise in serious economic, social and political difficulties--  
   Listen to this--  
   including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes which are faced by many countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  
   They could lead to crises in European stability. 
   Did that create legally binding obligations and commitments on the United States in 1991? No, it didn't. And nobody suggested that the President should submit that language, because there is no legally binding obligation or commitment from that kind of language, although in the words of the Strategic Concept in 1991 they recognized--this is what our leaders said in all of the NATO nations--``that the developments they can place in Europe would have a far-reaching impact on the way in which NATO's aims would be met in the future.'' 
   ``Far-reaching impacts,'' 1991. 
   I commend--and I had an opportunity to do this a few minutes ago--the efforts of the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Virginia, and the Senator from Maine, and others to bring to our attention what this new Strategic Concept is, so that we as a Senate can understand what it is that NATO is looking at in terms of a strategic concept. It is very important that those hearings the Senator from Virginia made reference to take place. In my own opinion, if the Foreign Relations Committee has not already done so--and I don't believe they have, but I may be wrong--it is important that the Foreign Relations Committee have hearings on this Strategic Concept. 
   Again, I don't have any difficulty with the language in this resolution, because I think it is appropriate that the President tell us whether or not we have undertaken in this language any new obligations or commitments. The President wrote my good friend from Virginia on April 14 that the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States. I assume that he will 
   reaffirm that in fact there are no new commitments or obligations when he gives us the certification which is required in this resolution. 
   I just want to summarize by saying that I have no difficulty with this language, because I think it is appropriate we have that assurance, because if there are new commitments or obligations--it seems to me there should be--then it would be presumably an amendment to a treaty which should be submitted to the Senate. But, again, just as there was none in 1991 when that new Strategic Concept which I just read was adopted by NATO, I don't believe there are more important--my belief is that the President has written the good Senator from Virginia that in fact there are no new commitments or obligations contained in this new Strategic Concept in 1999. 
   Again, I want to commend the Senators who have focused on this. I think we must address the new kind of environment we face in this world, and that it is important that NATO, which is going to play such a critical role in the stability of Europe and the new kinds of threats which we and Europe face, address those threats, that we do so in the context of the most successful alliance in the history of mankind, an alliance which is now growing, an alliance which when we added three new countries in this Senate, on this floor--we adopted the Kyl amendment that, as I remember it, contained 10 provisions--very similar to what is in this 1999 Strategic Concept. 
   I won't take the time to read more than just one section of the 10 principles in the Kyl amendment. 
   The Senate understands that the policy of the United States is that the core concepts contained in the 1991 Strategic Concept of NATO, which adapted NATO's strategic strategy of the post-cold-war environment, remain valid today in that the upcoming revision of that document will reflect the following provisions, and there are many.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1991 this is what the NATO new Strategic Concept said:  
   Risks to Allied security are less likely to result from calculated aggression against the territory of the Allies, but rather from the adverse consequences of instability that may arise from the serious economic, social, and political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes which are faced by many countries in central and eastern Europe. 
   They could ..... lead to crises inimical to European stability and to armed conflicts.  
   That is section 9. 
   Then they say, in addition to article 5, article 6 which they made reference to, an armed attack of the territory of the allies from whatever direction. In 1991, this new Strategic Concept said, ``However, alliance security must also take account of the global context.'' That is 1991--``Global context.''

   Mr. LEVIN. My only point in response to the Senator from Virginia, is that nobody suggested in 1991 that those words created a new binding obligation or commitment on the United States. I didn't hear it in 1991; I didn't hear it in 1992; I didn't hear it in 1993; I didn't hear it in 1994. 
   ``Global context'' alliance security must take account. 
   Why didn't anybody make that argument in the 8 years since 1991? The answer is, because it didn't create any commitment or obligation, or else I assume somebody on this floor would have argued there was a new commitment or argument--the very similar language. 
   In 1990, NATO got together and said the Soviet Union has fallen apart, and developments taking place in Europe have a far-reaching impact. This is a fundamental strategic review. 
   The only point I am making is I have no difficulty with the language in the good Senator's amendment, because I think we should have the assurance that there is no binding obligation or commitment represented by these new strategic concepts that NATO adopts. I happen to think that is very important. 
   I repeat that the Senator has received that assurance from the President of the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield further while she is being interrupted, I want to commend the good Senator from Louisiana for her steadfastness, and for the sponsors' steadfastness on that very point. There was no provision for amnesty in Dayton. There was no provision for amnesty at Rambouillet. There should be no such provision, nor should the door be opened a crack to any such possibility. People must be held accountable for war crimes. I do not think for 1 minute that there is room for negotiation on that issue, or else we will see an endless repetition of the kind of cleansing of ethnic groups that we have seen in the Balkans. 
   I commend the sponsors, and particularly the Senator from Louisiana for her strength and support.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Nevada for not only all of his help in getting bills passed but also in realistically assessing situations, which is part of his job. 
   I must say, given the amendments we already know of, while I am hopeful, too, of completing action on this bill at some point this week, I do not see how the hopes, as expressed here, can come to reality, given the substance of some of these amendments. 
   Again, the Kosovo amendment alone, I think, would precipitate a significant, lengthy debate on this floor, given all of the circumstances and the length of time which that subject has already required for debate, and the fact that we are in the middle of a conflict right now, and the ramifications for that conflict and the signals which would be sent to the prime creator of that conflict, Mr. Milosevic. It would be a lengthy debate, I think. I would like to finish this bill by Wednesday, too, but I just can't see, given that amendment and other amendments which are significant, that that is a realistic assessment.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Mr. Edgar Lee Newton. On May 23, 1999, Mr. Newton will be honored upon his retirement after 18 years as the president of the Bay City branch of the NAACP. 
   As president of the Bay City NAACP, Edgar Newton has fought many difficult battles for equality and civil rights. Although his tireless efforts on behalf of the NAACP are worthy of recognition in their own right, Mr. Newton has not confined his community service to the NAACP. He has also served with distinction in leadership roles with organizations like the American Red Cross, the United Way, Habitat for Humanity and the Kiwanis Club. 
   Edgar Newton's departure from the NAACP will mark a new chapter in his life. I can only hope it is as successful as his civil rights career. Though I am sure he will remain active in the Bay City community, he will enjoy spending more time with his wife Shirley and his two children and grandchild. I am pleased to join his colleagues, friends and family in offering my thanks for all he has done. 
   Mr. President, Edgar Newton can take pride in the many important achievements of his tenure with the NAACP. He has truly exhibited a dedication to justice and equality for all people. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting his commitment to civil rights and in wishing him well in his retirement.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with the passage of the Juvenile Justice bill today the Senate took a positive step forward in addressing the youth violence that we have sadly seen far too much of in recent weeks. 
   One month ago today, we watched in horror as children turned violent against other children, and we asked ourselves why? Today, again, we've seen the horror of a high school student firing a weapon at his schoolmates. There is no one cause of this youth violence, the causes are many but the common denominator in all of these school shootings cannot be ignored or denied: the easy access our young people have to guns. 
   If there is one silver lining in what happened at Littleton it's that this event has become a catalyst for the Senate to finally begin to overcome the disproportionate influence of the gun lobby and to close a few of the gaping loopholes in our federal gun laws which give our youth such easy access to guns. 
   Over the last few weeks, with the Juvenile Justice bill on the floor of the Senate, we have taken important steps to strengthen our current laws. We have passed legislation to prohibit juveniles from owning semiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammunition devices. We have banned the importation of big ammunition clips, which have been flooding into the United States by the millions. The Senate passed an amendment requiring that handguns be sold with trigger locking devices to protect children. And just this morning, the Senate, by one vote, the deciding vote cast by Vice President GORE, passed legislation to regulate the sale of firearms at guns shows, ensuring juveniles and others cannot use these shows as a convenient way to circumvent the safeguards applied to normal sales through licensed gun dealers. 
   Mr. President, I believe it's clear that the American people support the actions we have taken. In fact, I am hopeful that we will build on these first steps, for example, to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns for persons under 21 years of age. This may be one of our most important tasks yet. According the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the two most frequent ages at which crimes are committed with gun possession are 18 and 19. In 1997, 22% of those arrested for murder were 18, 19 or 20 years old. 
   This legislation clearly falls short of closing all of the loopholes which allow our youth easy access to deadly weapons. However, in the wake of the tragedy at Littleton, the Senate has taken critical steps forward. This is a victory for the good sense of the American people over the entrenched interests of NRA lobbyists in Washington. 
   Mr. President, in addition to preventing our youth from having access to deadly weapons, we must also ensure that schools have access to proven violence prevention programs designed to meet the particular needs of the students. The bill provides $250 million in grants for projects that allow schools to partner with the U.S. Department of Justice and police officers in crime prevention; $113 million for creative on-site school violence prevention programs and alcohol nd drug counseling; and amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to make funds available for training in school safety and violence prevention, crisis preparedness, mentoring and anti-violence programs.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Santorum amendment aims at trying to reduce the number of tragedies that result when persons convicted of serious offenses obtain early release and then repeat the offense. 
   But the mechanism it selects to advance that goal is so unworkable that it will undermine its laudable purpose. The same crime is defined differently by different States. Average terms of imprisonment imposed by States are different from average actual lengths of imprisonment. Indeed, that is part of the problem. Those are just two of the unworkable parts of Sec. (c)(1)(C)(ii). 
   One big problem in Sec. (c)(1)(B) is that the cost of incarceration of an individual can't be known unless one can predict his or her life expectancy. 
   An unworkable procedure will not help this cause. It will set it back, I am afraid, and I cannot vote for it.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Jewish  Community Council of Metropolitan Detroit, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary on May 23, 1999. 
   The Jewish Community Council brings together more than 200 Jewish community organizations under one umbrella, enabling the community to act in a unified way on issues of shared interest and concern. The Council's activities include building partnerships between people of different faiths and ethnic backgrounds, working to strengthen Metropolitan Detroit's Jewish community, and providing information to state and federal legislators about important issues. 
   The people of Metropolitan Detroit have always been able to count on the Jewish Community Council for assistance. The Council administers an annual food drive conducted by a broad-based coalition of community organizations, provides volunteers to an interfaith effort to revitalize economically distressed areas of the City of Detroit, and has fought to restore food stamps for legal immigrants. 
   One of the Council's most impressive achievements is its continuing effort to build bridges between people of different backgrounds. Some of the programs sponsored by the Council include the Detroit/Israel Student Exchange and Seeds of Peace program. The Detroit/Israel Student Exchange sends Detroit Public School students to Israel, and the students subsequently host Israeli teens at their homes in Detroit. Seeds of Peace is an innovative program which works to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East by bringing together Arab and Israeli teenagers at a summer camp in Maine with daily conflict-resolution sessions led by professional American, Arab and Israeli facilitators. The Council also works with other ethnic communities to welcome new immigrants to Michigan and to provide swearing-in ceremonies for new American citizens. 
   As I travel across America and too often see people disconnected from each other, I am more and more certain that the strong sense of community in the Jewish community is a pillar of our strength and an essential path to our well-being. The Jewish community comes together to educate our young, house our seniors, take care of immigrants, and provide culture and recreation. I watched this sense of community with wonder when I was a boy and I see it with great pride as a man. This deeply felt sense of community--of being part of something larger than our individual selves-- is a vital part of who we are. 
   The Jewish Community Council serves as the ``public face'' of this extraordinary community and I know my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations on its 60th anniversary, and in wishing the Council continued success in the future.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have great sympathy for the motives and objectives of the Senator from Colorado in offering this amendment. We all want to support the appropriate service and memorial for victims of such tragic events. However, I did not support the Allard amendment because, in my judgement, it too broadly states a view regarding constitutionality under the First Amendment and arbitrarily singles out memorials for victims who are slain on the campus of a public school, excluding memorial services involving victims of slayings during a robbery or other event not on the school's campus or victims of a tragic accident, for example. Also, I do not believe that the Senate should take the step of authorizing the Attorney General to become involved in litigation on one side or the other.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, violence in television shows, video games, and movies horrifies us as parents and grandparents. However, I support the tabling of the Hollings amendment because, in my judgment, it would have gone too far in giving the Government the responsibility for keeping violent television programming away from our children. The principal responsibility belongs in the hands of parents and grandparents. Putting this responsibility in an agency like the FCC to determine what is too violent and what is not is not only of questionable constitutionality, it would foster the idea that the Government should be doing this job. That confuses and defuses the clear message to parents that the principal responsibility is theirs. We should give parents the tools to do this as we have tried to do through the ``V-chip'' filtering technology. The first V-chip equipped televisions are expected to become available this summer. We should also focus the principal responsibility on parents, so that the V-chip is effectively used.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from California, and I commend her and the Senator from Rhode Island and others who are actively pursuing this very important amendment. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado struck a chord with every American. Three weeks ago, we watched in disbelief as children turned violent against other children, and we asked ourselves why. There is no single answer to that question. The violence in movies, on television, and in video games alarms us all. Our culture is surely far too violent. But, in these school shootings, we see one crucial common denominator: guns. 
   Guns kill some 35,000 people in the United States each year. We've grown so accustomed to the carnage that guns cause that only the most horrific acts of violence are capable of shaking us from our slumber. We paused in the Senate to observe a moment of silence to pay tribute to those who died at Columbine High School and to express our  sympathy for their loved ones. But now with this latest tribute for the victims in Littleton behind us, we need to be anything but silent. 
   There is no one cause of youth violence, the causes are many. But among them there is one that cannot be ignored or denied: the easy access our young people have to deadly weapons. 
   Violence in television shows, video games and movies horrifies us as parents and grandparents. But these same programs and those same games are the predominant entertainment in many other countries, as well, which have a small fraction of our gun murder rate. Look at our border with Canada. In 1997, the U.S. death rate involving firearms was about 14 per 100,000 people. The rate for Canada was less than one-third of that, about 4. Canadian towns on our border watch exactly the same T.V. and movies we do. Their kids play the same video games as ours. In 1997, there were 354 firearm homicides in Detroit; across the river in Windsor, Ontario, one fifth its population, there were only 4. The crucial difference is the easy availability of firearms in the U.S. 
   If we equate the populations, that would mean that on an apples and apples basis, Windsor would have had 20 firearm homicides. They watch the same television, they watch the same movies, and they play the same video games. We had 354 firearm homicides in Detroit; Windsor has 20 on a comparable basis. 
   The crucial difference isn't, then, the atmosphere of violence which pervades too much of our environment; the critical, crucial difference is the easy availability of firearms in the United States. 
   No matter how severe this plague of gun violence is for society as a whole, for the young it is far worse. For young males, the firearm death rate is nearly twice that of all diseases combined. One hundred and thirty-five thousand guns are brought into U.S. schools every day, according to an estimate by the National School Board Association--135,000 guns every day brought into our schools. Guns are not the cause of violent emotion, but guns are the predominant cause of violent killings and murders when such violent emotions are acted out. 
   There are numerous loopholes in the Federal gun laws which I think would surprise most Americans. The Feinstein amendment before the Senate addresses loopholes which allow youth access to, for instance, the assault weapons which have been discussed. Most of these are commonsense proposals. 
   Ten years ago, maybe now a little longer than that, former Senator Barry Goldwater first heard that a madman walked into a schoolyard in Stockton, CA, with a rapid-firing AK-47 and shot off 100 rounds in 2 minutes, killing 5 children and wounding 30. Senator Goldwater said, ``I'm completely opposed to selling automatic rifles, and I have been a member of the NRA. I collect, make, and shoot guns. I've never used an automatic or semiautomatic for hunting. There is no need to. They have no place in anybody's arsenal.'' 
   Senator Goldwater was right when he said that assault weapons have no sporting purpose. How many more tragedies will it take before, at a bare minimum, we take assault weapons and large ammunition clips out of the hands of children? 
   This amendment does that. I hope this Senate will give its support. I commend the Senators from California and Rhode Island.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill introduced today by Senator MOYNIHAN which will help to reduce some of the financial strain that teaching hospitals are currently experiencing due to Graduate Medical Education (GME) cuts put in place under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). 
   The teaching hospitals in this nation are the very best in the world. There are over 1,200 teaching hospitals in the United States, 57 of which are in my own state of Michigan. Although these hospitals are providing excellent care while training residents, they are currently facing dire financial circumstances brought about by the growth of managed care combined with GME payment reductions. Additional Medicare payment reductions are currently scheduled to be phased in as per the BBA. 
   A major teaching hospital in my own state, the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), trains over 1,100 residents each year. The DMC stands to lose a total of $53.8 million from IME reductions for Fiscal Years 1998-2002. It is important that we continue to support the DMC and other teaching hospitals, not turn our back on them. 
   I believe that the survival of our valuable teaching hospitals is at stake if we do not act now which is why I have cosponsored this legislation. This bill will freeze the Indirect Medical Education (IME) adjustment factor (the IME is the part of the GME payment that reflects the higher costs, such as more intensive treatments, of caring for patients at teaching hospitals) at the FY 1999 level of 6.5 percent, thereby rolling back about half of the IME funding cuts in the BBA. In total, this provision restores about $3 billion over 5 years and $8 billion over 10 years in IME funding for teaching hospitals. 
   Our medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals conduct a great deal of the research and medical education which benefits everyone in America. The University of Michigan is one of the most prominent teaching institutions in the country. The UM is currently doing important prostate cancer research while providing health care to citizens from every county in the state. It is imperative that we allow this research to continue while we are on the verge of new discoveries in medical science. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Senate will pass this important legislation.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Macomb County, Michigan for its tribute to a brave World War II soldier, Private First Class Walter C. Wetzel. With the dedication of a bust of Private Wetzel at the new county administration building, Macomb County will recognize the selfless actions of an American war hero. 
   Walter C. Wetzel entered the United States Army in Roseville, Michigan and served in European theater. Private Wetzel was an acting squad leader with the Antitank Company of the 13th Infantry in Birken, Germany, during the early morning hours of April 3, 1945, when he detected strong enemy forces moving in to attack. Private Wetzel alerted his comrades and immediately began defending their post against heavy automatic weapons fire. Under cover of darkness, the Germans eventually forced their way close to the American position, hurling two grenades into the room where Private Wetzel and others had taken up firing positions. Shouting a warning to his fellow soldiers, Private Wetzel threw himself on the grenades and absorbed their entire blast, suffering wounds from which he died. The supreme gallantry of Private Wetzel saved his comrades from death or serious injury and made it possible for them to continue the defense of their post. His unhesitating sacrifice of his life was in keeping with the highest traditions of bravery and heroism. Because of his actions, Private Wetzel was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   Private Wetzel and his courageous deeds have considerable meaning to his family, and to the residents of Macomb County and the State of Michigan. Private Wetzel is the only person from Macomb County to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. His life has been honored by the Michigan State Legislature and an important street in Macomb County was named Pfc. Walter Wetzel Drive. 
   Mr. President, Private Wetzel is an example of the selfless and courageous commitment our soldiers display every day. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting Macomb County for its recognition of Private First Class Walter C. Wetzel and the sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Services.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is National Hospital Week, and one of Michigan's hospitals, Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is being honored by the American Hospital Association (AHA). National Hospital Week gives health care workers, volunteers, and other health professionals the recognition that they deserve for all the care they provide. 
   Spectrum Health has been singled out by the AHA for its Universal Infant Hearing Screening program, located at Spectrum's Downtown Campus in Grand Rapids. This program is the recipient of the AHA's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer Excellence, an award which highlights special contributions of hospital volunteers. 
   Spectrum's Universal Infant Hearing Screening program identifies potential hearing loss in all babies born at or transferred to the Spectrum Health Downtown Campus. It is well known that such early identification and intervention can prevent a hearing problem from becoming a handicap. 
   Universal Infant Hearing Screening volunteers must undergo extensive training to prepare for this program. After the volunteers administer the screening, audiologists review the test results to identify infants with potential problems. Those infants with abnormal results are referred for re-screening or diagnostic testing. Without the work of the volunteers, it would be impossible to provide this vital service to the thousands of babies born at Spectrum Health every year. 
   Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Spectrum Health for its award winning program.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week I addressed the Economic Club of Detroit, one of the most influential groups of community leaders in my State. I expressed the depth of my continuing concern about the level of violence in our society, particularly youth violence. I committed myself to continue to speak out against the easy access to guns, especially by young people. I intend to comment on this subject every week in the Senate, when the Senate is in session, to highlight the need of our Nation to face this critical issue, to discuss the growing crisis fueled by weapons among our young people, and to urge action to meet our responsibility in the Senate to work towards solutions. 
   There is no one cause of youth violence. The causes are many. But among them there is one that cannot be ignored or denied, the easy access to deadly weapons for our young people. If we are honest with ourselves, we will admit it is too easy for children to get their hands on guns because we made it too easy to get guns, period; too easy to get guns that have nothing to do with the needs of hunters and sportsmen, guns that are too often used to kill people. 
   Yes, we have all heard the glib rhetoric of the NRA, that ``guns don't kill people, people kill people.'' This bumper-sticker logic obscures the real truth. People with guns kill people, and they do it some 35,000 times a year in this country. That is more deaths than we suffered in the 3-year-long Korean war. The number of times that handguns were used to commit murder is itself staggering, some 9,300 times in the United States in 1996. In that same year in Japan, a nation almost half our size, there were 15 murders with handguns--just 15 handgun murders for a country with half our population. There were 9,300 murders here in the United States. 
   We have every right as parents and as consumers to expect some responsibility from the entertainment industry. But I am told Japanese popular culture is even more violent than our own. 
   However severe this plague of gun violence is for society as a whole, for the young it is far worse. For young males, the firearm death rate is nearly twice that of all other diseases combined. A National Centers for Disease Control study found 2 of every 25 high school students reported having carried a gun in the previous 30 days. If those numbers were evenly distributed among communities and schools, that would mean that in the average classroom, two students have carried guns at some time in the previous month. 
   These figures are shocking, but they are hardly secret. We have grown so accustomed to the carnage that guns cause in America that only the most horrific acts of violence are capable of shaking us from our slumber. As I told the Economic Club of Detroit, the question we have to ask ourselves in the wake of the Columbine High School tragedy is: Are we willing to say that enough is enough? And will we say it not just today but next week and next month and next year? 
   The NRA is betting we will not. They believe their brand of single-minded, single-issue politics can once again paralyze us from acting, once these images of death and pain in Colorado fade from view. They are going to go on telling their members that even the most measured gun control proposal is a thinly veiled attempt to take away their legitimate hunting weapons. It will not stop there. They will use that membership as a potent political tool to intimidate candidates for office. It 
   is a sad fact that, thus far, too many Americans and too many American children and their parents live in fear of gun violence because too many of us in Washington live in fear of the political power of the lobbyists of the NRA. 
   I believe there is also a power when people unite to demand action--businesspeople, labor union people, parents, teachers, police officers, young people, the clergy. When I look at the kind of coalition that could be represented by groups like that, I see a potential power that could dwarf any narrow special interest. The question is not whether we are in the majority. The polls show that a large majority of Americans will support strong action to reduce access of minors to guns. The question is not whether we have the power. We do. The question is whether we are willing to act to make America a safer country. For starters, we must ban the possession and sale of handguns, semiautomatic weapons, by and to minors. 
   We paused in this Chamber to observe a moment of silence in honor of the victims of gun violence in Colorado. We observe these moments of silence to pay tribute to those who have died and to express our sympathy for their loved ones. But now, with this latest tribute behind us, we need to be anything but silent. Those of us who want to act to reduce the gun violence need to be louder and clearer and stronger and, yes, more persistent than the NRA. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I am likely to offer, but I need to engage in some floor discussion with the managers prior to making that decision. I think it may take about a half an hour to an hour to go through a discussion with the managers on this subject. 
   It is a very important subject. It has to do with whether or not the SEC is going to be able to regulate the purchase and sale of stock when they are done by banks. The SEC sent me a letter yesterday strongly objecting to language in this bill, and what they are pointing out is that the language in the committee report is different from the language in the bill. 
   I want to talk to the managers about an amendment which would incorporate in the bill what the committee report says is the intent of the bill. It is possible that this will be accepted because this is committee report language which I am trying to get into the bill, but I do not know until after we go through the discussion process on the floor. I just want to alert colleagues that could take perhaps a half an hour to an hour.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to send an amendment to the desk. But I want to explain exactly the reason for this amendment. 
   A couple of days ago, I wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission and asked them what their reaction was to the bill as drafted in terms of protecting investors. The answer that I got back from Arthur Levitt dated May 5 is that the provisions of the bill raise serious concerns about investors' protection, and, if adopted, could hamper the Commission's effective oversight of U.S. security markets. 
   The letter also indicated that:  
   A loophole exempting bank trust activities from Federal securities laws would, therefore, seriously weaken the commission's ability to protect investors.  
   And:  
   Adoption of the bank trust exemption in S. 900, in addition to other securities provisions  in the bill, would undermine the important investor protections that make our markets the most transparent, most liquid in the world. It is for these reasons that the commission strongly opposes the bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also received a letter from the North American Securities Administrators Association. This is the association that was organized in 1919, and consists of the 50 States' securities agencies that are responsible to protect investors. 
   The letter from the North American Securities Administrators Association indicates very strong problems with this bill, because, in its words, sections 501 and 502 would allow the bank to act as an investment adviser if the bank receives a fee, and ``as currently drafted, despite the claim that S. 900 would facilitate functional regulation of the securities activity in banks, banks will remain largely exempt from regulation as either a broker or dealer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.'' 
   This is very, very troubling. This is a very big issue, because it is stated in the report which accompanies the bill that the bill generally adheres to the principle of functional regulation, which holds that similar activities should be regulated by the same regulator, and that the bill is intended to ensure that banking activities are regulated by bank regulators, securities activities are regulated by securities regulators, and insurance activities are regulated by insurance regulators. 
   The report that accompanies the bill indicates that the intent is to adhere to the principle of functional regulation, which would mean that securities regulators would indeed regulate securities transactions, but the securities regulators write us that that is not what the bill does because of the way in which the exemption is drafted in the bill; that in effect all purchases and sales of stock by banks could be run through a trust department and be exempt from the Securities and Exchange Commission protection and from local regulations. 
   That is a major problem with the bill. When you are a securities regulator, and when the people who are there intending to protect the public who are buying stocks indicate strong opposition to the bill based on that, it seems to me that some alarm bells ought to be going off in this Chamber.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator SCHUMER is a cosponsor of an amendment which I am now offering which reads as follows. It is fairly short. I simply want to read this amendment. Then I will send it to the desk. 
   The amendment has now been accepted by the manager of the bill. I think it will help somewhat to allay some concerns in this area. But the critical issue is what will come out of conference. That, of course, we don't know. But this is the language of the amendment, which I will be sending to the desk on my behalf and on behalf of Senator SCHUMER.  
   It is the intention of this act, subject to carefully defined exceptions which do not undermine the dominant principle of functional regulation, to ensure that securities transactions affected by a bank are regulated by securities regulators notwithstanding any other provision of this act.  
   The intention is to keep the principle that securities transactions will be regulated by securities regulators, and acknowledges that there could be some carefully drafted exceptions which do not undermine the dominant principle. 
   That, it seems to me, would be an improvement in this area. 
   I want to again thank my friend from Texas for looking at this language, indicating that it would be acceptable to him, and then, of course, the proof of the pudding as to whether we are really protecting purchasers of stock through the regulators who are there to protect purchasers and sellers of stock will be determined in conference. But the general principle enunciated in this amendment would go to conference as the principle that is governing this bill. 
   I also want to thank my good friend from New York, because he has worked so closely with me on this issue. 
   I can't yield the floor to him. But I will yield the floor. But, before doing so, and I know he does wish to speak for a few minutes, I will send the amendment to the desk.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th birthday of Little Caesars Enterprises, an extraordinary company headquartered in my home state of Michigan and my hometown of Detroit. 
   It is not possible to talk about Little Caesars without recognizing the efforts of the founders of the company, Mike and Marian Ilitch. Mike and Marian are not only fine examples of entrepreneurship. They exemplify the American Dream itself. These two first-generation Americans, both of Macedonian descent, opened their first Little Caesars restaurant in Garden City, Michigan on May 8, 1959. After only three years, they sold their first Little Caesars franchise. The company became an international enterprise in 1969, with the opening of its first restaurant in Canada. By 1987, Little Caesars restaurants could be found in all 50 states. Today, Little Caesars' markets include the U.S., Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Korea, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Turkey, the Philippines, Ecuador, Aruba and Egypt. 
   The Ilitch family and the employees of Little Caesars have demonstrated a deep commitment to the City of Detroit. Several years ago, many people characterized the decision to move Little Caesars' headquarters to downtown Detroit was ``an act of faith.'' Today, other companies are following in Little Caesars footsteps and the City of Detroit's business climate is truly on the rebound. Throughout the years, Little Caesars has sponsored youth sports, especially hockey, and given generously to charitable causes. One of the most notable charitable endeavors supported by Little Caesars is the Little Caesars Love Kitchen Foundation, a mobile pizza restaurant which has fed more than 1.2 million people since it was created in 1985. The Love Kitchen Foundation has been recognized by Presidents Clinton, Bush and Reagan for its service to those in need. 
   Many people credit the success of Little Caesars to its ``buy one, get one free'' concept. Others say its the creative, witty advertising. But anyone who knows Mike and Marian Ilitch knows that Little Caesars is truly a labor of love, and that they are at the heart of their company's success. And if the Ilitches are the heart and soul of Little Caesars, the hundreds of thousands of men and women who have worked for the company or who have owned a Little Caesars franchise have been its backbone. Those employees have helped to make Little Caesars the dynamic, successful enterprise it is today. 
   Mr. President, I know my colleagues join me in offering congratulations and best wishes for continuing success to Mike and Marian Ilitch, their family, and the entire Little Caesars organization as they celebrate the company's 40th birthday.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA was enacted in 1977 to encourage banks to serve the credit needs of the entire community including low and middle income areas. The obligations that banks owe to the entire community stem from their charters and the public benefits they receive through the Federal Reserve. The CRA is a way to encourage banks to live up to their public obligation. 
   Nationwide the CRA has been recognized as an effective way to increase credit availability in underserved  areas. In his testimony before the House Banking Committee in February, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan remarked, that the CRA has ``very significantly increased the amount of credit in communities'' and the changes have been ``quite profound.'' In 1997 alone, almost 2,000 banks and thrifts reported $64 billion in CRA loans, including 525,000 small business loans worth $34 billion; 213,000 small farm loans totaling $11 billion; and 25,000 community development loans totaling $19 billion. Those loans went to affordable housing projects, economic development through financing small businesses or farms, and activities that revitalize or stabilize low or moderate income areas. CRA has also encouraged a dramatic increase in home ownership by low and moderate income individuals. Between 1993 and 1997, private sector conventional home mortgage lending in low and moderate income census tracts increased by 45%. 
   And the CRA has done so without forcing a large paperwork burden onto banks and without forcing banks to make bad loans. During the same House hearing, Chairman Greenspan alluded to the mutual benefit of the CRA to consumers and banks when he said, ``CRA has helped financial institutions to discover new markets that may have been underserved before.'' 
   While there are countless examples of the Act's effectiveness in encouraging lending in underserved areas all over the country. Here's some examples from Michigan. Lake Osceola State Bank in Baldwin just completed their CRA exam under the reformed 1996 regulations. They said it was not a burden, and they received a rating of outstanding. Under the terms of S. 900, the bill before us today, Lake Osceola State Bank would qualify for an exemption from the CRA because of their size and location, but the bank has told my office that they are not seeking a CRA exemption. To the contrary, they are justifiably proud of the contributions they are making to community development in the Baldwin area. 
   We Care, Inc. is a small non-profit that rehabilitates a few houses a year in Detroit's Van Dyke and 7 Mile area. They say the CRA and National City Bank have been their life-line for credit. 
   Northwest Detroit Neighborhood Development, Inc. is yet another nonprofit organization that has contacted me in support of the CRA. They praised the National Bank of Detroit and Comerica for extending credit to them and supporting their mission of homebuilding in the Brightmore area of Detroit. 
   The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a nationally prominent community development group that operates in five Michigan cities, considers the CRA critical to their efforts. In an effort to boost their CRA scores, lenders have sought out groups like LISC and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to develop ``shared risk'' loan pools that offer financing to first time home buyers. Over the past 5 years, more than 400 mortgages were written in six Michigan cities. This has generated over $16 million in direct public and private investment in central city neighborhoods. According to LISC, without the CRA ``these types of programs would not have been established.'' Other Michigan community development groups like U-SNAP-BAC, SWAN and New Hope also rely on loans encouraged by the CRA. 
   Many Michigan mayors have expressed their support for the CRA. They praise the CRA for encouraging private business investment and creating new jobs and businesses in their communities. In addition, money from federal grants is leveraged to obtain millions of dollars in private investment. There are twelve mayors from all over Michigan on this letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors supporting the CRA. I oppose the provisions weakening the CRA included in S. 900, a bill intended to modernize the financial sector of our economy. Both small and large banks in Michigan have received outstanding CRA ratings. The community groups and nonprofits make great use of the resources which are made available through the CRA. The federal independent agency that oversees the nation's banking system says its not onerous and has been very successful. Therefore, I will not support a bill that weakens a program that has been so important to community development efforts in Michigan and nationally.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend from Arizona. Always, he puts his finger on an issue--in this case, on an issue of war and an issue of conscience. And this is an issue of both. 
   There is nobody who more eloquently or doggedly pursues both issues--war and conscience--and the implications of both. And the experience that he brings--as does our good friend from Georgia, and others--to this body is absolutely indispensable in trying to work its way towards the right conclusion in many of these issues. And I just, again, add my gratitude to what he adds to this body, to this Nation. 
   Mr. President, while I favor the thrust of the resolution before us, I do not favor its timing, and I will vote to table. I want to just take a few moments this evening to explain this. 
   The stakes are tremendously high in Kosovo. We simply must not fail. We cannot fail to succeed in Kosovo. NATO must not fail to succeed in Kosovo. 
   Even before I visited the refugee camps a week or so ago, I felt strongly about this. But meeting with the refugees, of course, reinforces my conclusion about the nature of Mr. Milosevic's ethnic cleansing. 
   This century of ours began with a genocide against Armenians; it is ending with an ethnic cleansing against the Kosovars; and there was a holocaust in between. 
   If we want the next century to be freer of the slaughter that this century has seen in so many wars, we simply must support the united action of a united Europe to stop the success of Milosevic in his goals in Kosovo. 
   Of course, when you read about what the refugees have gone through, and you talk to refugees, it reinforces that determination--the stories of mass executions, mass rapes, the burning of 400 villages by forces that presumably should be protecting those villages, since Milosevic claims sovereignty in Kosovo. But instead of pursuing what sovereigns historically have done, which is to protect people they claim sovereignty over, this particular dictator is trying to destroy the very people of Kosovo. 
   NATO made a statement last week which is of critical importance. It restates a decision on the part of NATO to prevail. And the only way--the best way, but perhaps the only way--that we are going to have a century next which is more peaceful in Europe and elsewhere than the current century, is if NATO succeeds in its unified determination, as stated in Washington just about a week ago. 
   Two sentences kind of say it all. And those two sentences are these: ``We will not allow Milosevic's campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is determined to prevail.'' 
   This has rarely been true in Europe. I am not sure it has ever been true where we have 19 nations, including the United States and Canada, that have come together to try to stop a genocide from succeeding in their backyard. 
   Europe has been divided before now--France, England on one side, sometimes Germany on another, countries divided into blocs against each other. But now what we have in Europe is the coming together of all of the European nations, making one joint statement about what they will not permit in their own land. ``We will not allow Milosevic's campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is determined to prevail.'' 
   But that unity which is so critical to the success of the mission, I believe, will be negatively impacted if the Senate adopts this resolution that is before us, because this resolution would put this Senate and this Nation ahead of NATO. And we have to work in harmony with NATO, in unity with NATO, in harness with 18 other democracies that have taken a position. And that position is that we are going to pursue, relentlessly, doggedly the success of the military mission and air campaign, the purpose of which is to significantly diminish Milosevic's military capability. 
   That is the current mission. 
   It is hoped the success of that mission will achieve the broader policy objective of being able to return refugees, now over 1 million, to their homes in Kosovo. If that military mission and  its success in reducing Milosevic's capability to keep a stranglehold on Kosovo does not achieve the broader mission of being able to return these refugees, at that point we can consider changing the military mission. At that point we can consider the use of ground troops by NATO. 
   Is it prudent to plan for that? Yes, it is. In my judgment, it is prudent to plan for it. Would it be prudent, in fact, to carry it out once the groundwork has been laid and Milosevic's military capability has been significantly weakened? Yes, in my judgment it would be. Most important to the success of this mission, broad and narrow, is NATO's unity. It is my fear that the adoption of this resolution will put us in a significantly different position than the rest of NATO, in advance of a need to do so. 
   NATO is unified on an air campaign. It is not yet unified on a ground campaign. The Apaches alone, after their employment begins, will take 30 to 60 days before they have a significant impact on the ground. That is what General Clark, the commander, has told us. That may not be the common wisdom, common understanding, common media message, but that is the truth, as General Clark believes it--that it will take 30 to 60 days for the Apaches to have an effect after they begin to be employed. So the debate over authorizing ground forces is a premature debate. I believe it will distract us from a current unified mission while we are in the middle of an air campaign. 
   It is for that reason that, with some reluctance, I am 
   going to vote to table the resolution, the general direction of which I support, because it is so critically important that we be unified and united with NATO allies, that we stay together in planning and in execution of a mission which must succeed. We must not be distracted by a premature debate about ground forces. Prudence and common sense would indicate that we plan for such a contingency, but there is no need for us to authorize it at this time. It seems to me, if anything, it will divide and distract, rather than protect that critical unity which is so essential to the success of this mission. 
   Again, I commend my good friend from Arizona and Senator BIDEN, Senator LIEBERMAN, and the other cosponsors for their support of a very important position, which is that we now must win. That is the thrust of this resolution. Again, while I support that thrust, I will vote to table for the reasons indicated. 
   I thank the Chair and, again, thank my good friend from Arizona.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the President has approved the call-up of up to 33,000 Reservists to support NATO operations over Kosovo. Reserve forces are playing an ever-increasing role in military operations. With the downsizing of our Active forces and the increased number of missions, our Armed Forces cannot operate successfully without use of our Reserve component resources. For example, of the 540,000 service members deployed to Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield/Desert Storm, 228,000, or 42%, were reservists. Reservists have also answered the call for service in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, and Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT GUARD in Bosnia. 
   National Guard and Reserve forces are involved in helping Central America recover from the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, and they are routinely called upon to respond to disasters in the United States. As the Reserve components are relied on more and more, even during nornal times they are called away from their civilian jobs more and more. 
   The absence of these men and women from their families, jobs and businesses while they are serving their country on active duty will clearly present some hardships. We should do everything we can do to try minimize any economic hardships that might arise from their absence on their businesses and places of employment. That is why I have cosponsored the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act that Mr. KERRY has introduced today to provide financial and business development assistance to military reservists' small businesses. 
   This legislation will help military reservists who are called away from their jobs and businesses to serve the United States in any military operation with respect to Kosovo by allowing them to defer existing government guaranteed small business loans and giving them access to low interest rate government guaranteed loans to bridge any financial gap that might arise out of their absence. These Reservists will be eligible for assistance if they are an owner, manager or key employee of a small business. 
   This legislation provides more generous loan repayment terms for small business reservists who have SBA loans. It does this by authorizing a deferral of loan repayments for small business reservists on any direct loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), including disaster loans. Interest will not accrue during the time that the loan is deferred. The legislation also directs SBA to develop policies such as extending repayments of its government guaranteed loans such as micro loans or 7(a) loans for reservists who are called up for active duty. The deferrals will be available from the date the reservist is called to active duty until 180 days after his or her release from active duty. 
   The legislation also establishes a low interest economic injury loan program to be administered by SBA through its disaster loan program. Such loans would be made available to provide interim operating capital to any small business when the departure of a military reservist to active duty causes economic harm.  
   The legislation also directs the SBA and its private sector partners to make every effort to reach out to those businesses affected by the absence of key employees who are Reservists and provide assistance such as businesses counseling and training for how to run the business in the absence of these key employees. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation designed to reduce any economic hardship created by the absence of active duty reservists from their jobs and businesses and I hope the Senate will act on it quickly.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend, two very special people, Stan and Iris Ovshinsky, will be honored by the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Jewish heritage and Yiddish culture, and to pursuing social and economic justice. 
   The organization's selection of Stan and Iris is most fitting. Their work on behalf of social causes and their love of Yiddish culture has been a constant part of their lives. But what makes Stan and Iris so special is that theirs is also a great love story. Stan and Iris met, fell very much in love, married  and dedicated themselves to ``Tikkun Olam,'' the Jewish belief in the responsibility to ``repair the world'' and leave it a better place for future generations. Their steadfast commitment to Tikkun Olam is nowhere more evident than in their work together at Energy Conversion Devices (ECD), the materials technology company they founded in Troy, Michigan in 1960 when they joined their lives together. 
   Stan, a self-taught inventor/scientist who never attended college, began working in the field of amorphous and disordered materials in 1955, when the scientific community regarded them as of little scientific interest. Iris, who has a PhD in biochemistry, joined him in his work after they met. Stan and Iris proved that these materials were of great value scientifically and technologically. Stan's initial paper describing their properties has become one of the five most cited publications in the history of the prestigious Physical Review Letters. That and subsequent papers, some co-authored with Iris, led to a new field of scientific study. 
   From the beginning, Stan and Iris understood the significance of their discoveries. They saw a future in which new engineered materials could be used to improve people's lives, solve societal problems and build new industries. They committed themselves and ECD to that vision and never wavered from it. Always on the cutting edge, often ahead of their time, they have stayed the course. Today, ECD holds over 350 active U.S. patents and over 800 corresponding foreign patients. Amorphous semiconductors and other engineered amorphous and disordered materials are now widely used in an array of products, many of which have been developed and commercialized at ECD. 
   Three technologies exemplify the Ovshinskys' ingenuity and commitment to their vision: 
   Amorphous Silicon Photovoltaics (PV): The Ovshinskys were determined to develop a practical and affordable method of generating electric power from the sun, and pioneered the use of amorphous silicon materials to reduce materials costs and energy used in a highly innovative roll-to-roll solar cell production process. Award winning products using their technologies are already in the marketplace. 
   Ovonuc Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries: The ``Ovonic'' battery is a high performing, nontoxic rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery. NiMH batteries are replacing nickel cadmium batteries used in portable electronic devices. Determined to develop products of benefit to society, the Ovshinskys led their company into developing the battery for advanced vehicle technologies to ease growing concerns over air pollution. NiMH batteries are the advanced electric vehicle battery of choice of major auto manufacturers. 
   Computer Information Storage Materials and Devices: The phase change erasable semiconductor materials developed by the Ovshinskys have become the standard in rewritable optical discs. Similar materials employing the same physics show the potential for use in electronic devices that can help the United States recapture its former dominant position in semiconductor memories. 
   The totality of Stan and Iris's achievements is remarkable. They pioneered a new branch of science and then successfully applied this science to develop new technologies and commercial products having significant impacts on the energy and information industries. Because of their efforts to solve major problems through science and technology, the world will be a better place. Now in their 70s, their work and their commitment continue unabated, as does their obvious love for and delight in one another.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to observe the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day which takes place on April 24. Each year we remember and honor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to still have with us. 
   During the periods 1915-1918 and 1920-1923, approximately 1.5 million Armenians perished under the rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The Armenian people fell victim to deportation, expropriation, torture, starvation and massacre. We signify April 24, 1915 as the day of remembrance because of the more than 200 Armenian community leaders who were systematically hunted down in Constantinople on this date. 
   The Armenian genocide was the result of a consciously orchestrated government plan. The United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, stated at the time that, ``When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact ..... I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this.'' 
   In an effort to further our understanding of this tragic period, one of my constituents, Mae Derdarian, has written an important survivor's account of the Armenian genocide. Her book, Vergeen, recounts a thirteen-year old girl's deportation from her home, the atrocities she survived, her escape from her tormentors, and her ultimate triumph over the horrors she witnessed and which were perpetrated on her. In a review of Ms. Derdarian's book, The Detroit Jewish News wrote ``Every now and then a book comes along that haunts the reader long after the last page is turned. Vergeen is one of those stories ..... Mae Derdarian has created a page-turner, combing Vergeen's memoir and her own mother's recorded accounts of what both women endured as survivors of the first genocide of the 20th century.'' Such first-hand accounts from survivors are critical to our understanding of genocide, and help us all to recognize and honor the lives of the victims. 
   Mr. President, each year we remember the horrors suffered by the Armenian people during the periods 1915-1918 and 1920-1923 under the Ottoman Empire. However, it is not enough to simply remember those who have perished. We must dedicate ourselves to see that tragedies such as the Armenian Genocide are not revisited on our planet. This is the highest tribute we can pay to the victims of any genocide. 
   The Armenian people have earned our enduring admiration for withstanding the horrors of two world wars and several decades of Soviet dominance in order to establish modern Armenia. The United States must continue its efforts to support freedom, prosperity and stability in Armenia as we honor and remember the victims of the Armenian Genocide.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article which appears in the April 19, 1999, edition of Forbes magazine regarding Focus: HOPE, an extraordinary organization in Detroit, Michigan which is dedicated to human development. 
   The article follows.  
   Teach A Man To Fish  
   Eleanor Josaitis can remember the moment in March 1965 her life changed. She was in her comfortable home in a Detroit suburb watching a television program on the Nuremberg trials. A news flash cut in: Selma, Ala. Mounted troopers, wielding electric cattle prods, charged peaceful protesters. Minutes earlier she was pondering what she would have done if she had been in Nazi Germany. A new question intruded: ``What will I do now?'' 
   Two years later Detroit exploded in flames. Touring the decimated area with Father William Cunningham, her weekend parish priest, they swore to alleviate the suffering. But what could be accomplished by a housewife with two young children and a radical priest trained as an English professor? 
   Quite a bit, actually. Focus: Hope, the nonprofit organization they birthed in Detroit's rubble, today occupies well over a million square feet on 40 acres of that once-devastated area. It started with urgent but limited goals--feeding poor mothers and their infants. Now it has grown into a powerful and world-recognized job-training machine. An education boot camp has lifted nearly 5,000 city residents to high school equivalence and placed them in real jobs. A machinist institute has trained 1,800 urban youngsters in reading blueprints and operating numerically controlled machine tools, and put them in high-paying positions with outfits like GM, Ford and Chrysler. A Center for Advanced Technologies has just started to churn out engineers with bachelor's degrees. Next up: an information technology center, funded by the likes of Microsoft and Cisco Systems, to teach computer skills. 
   Josaitis, age 67, built Focus: Hope on the simple proposition that many of the chronically underemployed yearn for an opportunity to haul themselves into the middle class. She says: ``We are failing our poorest citizens when we don't provide them the means to break out of their poverty.'' 
   What welfare official has not echoed precisely that thought? The Focus: Hope difference is one of execution. Josaitis runs the centers with businesslike efficiency and sets demanding standards for the students. She coddles no one: Use profane language after two warnings and you're out. Steal something and you're out immediately. She believes that discipline and responsibilitly are keys to improvement. Rewards must be earned. 
   That philosophy has made Focus: Hope a landmark in Detroit. It has attracted more than 50,000 Detroit-area volunteers, including big names at the car companies, like Ford Chief Executive Jacques Nasser. A sizable business itself, Focus: Hope employs more than 800 people and has a budget of $68 million, half from government, a third from contracts with for-profit companies and the rest from private contributions. 
   That's eons away from the rather inauspicious beginnings. To get closer to the problem, Eleanor and her husband, the owner of a chain of hobby shops, sold their house and moved into an integrated neighborhood in 1968. Her mother, alarmed for their safety, even hired a lawyer to try to wrest custody of her children away. Eleanor retained custody and bears no animosity toward her mother. 
   She and Father Cunningham, who died of cancer in 1997, began with food. Tapping federal funding, they launched a tiny program to distribute food to pregnant women and small children. It still does that, at last count for 46,000 people a month (half the peak in 1991). The program succeeded so well that it became a model for similar efforts in other states. A food program for senior citizens followed. 
   But Josaitis and Father Cunningham wanted to turn the recipients into productive jobholders. They browbeat and cajoled federal agencies and private foundations to raise $250,000 to start a job-training program. In 1981 they opened the Machinist Training Institute to train Detroit's youths in machining and metalworking, especially for the automobile industry. 
   It's an intensive program that can last for 57 weeks if students choose the entire curriculum. Students spend the first 5 weeks, eight hours a day, learning blueprint reading and some math and working the lathe. On the shop floor they later learn to work with mills, grinders and computer-controlled machine tools. In the classroom they learn more about manufacturing theory and quite a bit about computer-aided design and manufacturing. 
   In a more advanced program they work on commercial production contracts for about $7 an hour in between doses of classroom instruction. 
   Among the students who start the machinist school, 70% stay to the end. For those that do, the job placement rate is 100%. ``We have placed our graduates in all sorts of machine shops,'' says Josaitis. ``Some had never previously hired a minority or a female.'' 
   Josaitis has structured tuition to reflect her philosophy: a helping hand--with strings attached. Tuition for MTI is $14,500. Government grants pay about half that, depending on income. The balance is paid through a 5% loan from Focus: Hope. Repayment begins 90 days after graduation--by which time most students have jobs. A further incentive to land and keep a job is that many employers, like General Motors, will pick up half of the student's loan payments. 
   William Motts is one of the success stories. He dropped out of high school in the 11th grade and got his girlfriend pregnant at 18. He pulled in $6 an hour as a maintenance worker at a hotel, struggling to help support his daughter. 
   But he caught a break. He was steered to MTI by his father's friend who knew Father Cunningham. He entered the program in 1992 and never looked back. In 1998, he got a bachelor's degree in manufacturing engineering from the University of Detroit, Mercy. Today Motts, 25, is an engineer at General Motors earning around $45,000, and married to a dental hygienist. 
   ``Focus: Hope challenged me to push my boundaries,'' Motts says. ``It forced me to be disciplined. It gave me very marketable skills.'' 
   Focus: Hope helps students surmount practical problems. For examples, it runs a day care center and before- and after-school programs, so parents can attend classes without worry. 
   Josaitis also doesn't want to discard potential candidates who don't have the math, reading or social skills to succeed in a program for machinists. So for the past ten years an educational boot camp called Fast Track has taken students--average age 26--with 8th grade math and reading skills and brought them up two grade levels. And two years ago, realizing some students needed even more help, she started First Step, to offer more remedial works. 
   More than 80% of those who enter Fast Track finish the program and go on the Machinist Training Institute. Thomas Murphy, a former sergeant major for American troops in Europe who runs Fast Track, can take some credit for that. He is bluff, tough and good-natured. The seven-week Fast Track program runs all day Monday through Friday, and Saturday mornings. 
   ``Saturday classes serve clear notice that we expect real hard work and commitment from them in return for the opportunity we provide,'' Murphy says. Clock in at 8:01 and you get a demerit. Enough demerits and you get booted out. 
   Murphy was initially shocked when a candidate asked him if there was a place where he could nap during breaks. Turned out that he left the institute at 4 p.m., worked an eight-hour shift at a job to support his family and was back at 8 a.m. the next day. Murphy found him a place to nap and overlooked occasional tardiness. 
   ``One of our graduates called me up the other day to announce that he was missing his first day of work in years,'' says Murphy. ``He was closing on a brand new home. His home. The first home anyone in his family had ever owned.'' 
   Josaitis also understands that getting and holding a job requires certain social skills. Thus trainees are taught how to shake hands, make eye contact and absolutely, positively get to jobs on time. 
   Every month Josaitis brings a group of students to a formally laid out dining room where she teaches table manners, from which fork to use to how to make small talk. ``I want you to feel comfortable when you are invited to the White House,'' she tells them. She also takes trainees to formal affairs, such as the opening of the Michigan Opera hosted by Ford's Nasser. 
   In 1993 Focus: Hope decided to offer its best and brightest students a further step up the ladder. It opened the Center for Advanced Technologies, which, in collaboration with local colleges, offers bachelor and associate degrees in manufacturing engineering and technology. The executive dean is Lloyd  Reuss, who took the nonpaying job after he was ousted as president of General Motors in 1993. 
   CAT students get classroom instruction plus work in a for-profit manufacturing company located on Focus: Hope grounds. Using next-generation equipment from Cincinnati Milacron, says Reuss, students produce machined parts for outfits including GM, Ford and the Department of Defense. Students accept a below-market $8 an hour on these contracts. In return, they get free tuition. 
   The hands-on part of this apprenticeship is as important as the classroom instruction. Denise Ankofski, candidate for an associate degree and single mother of a 6-year-old son, was milling brake shoes for 5-ton trucks on a defense contract and figured she could do it better by splitting operations and performing them on different machines. She was encouraged to give a technical presentation and her suggestion reduced cycle time on some operations by 80%. 
   When they graduate, CAT students do extremely well. Last year the six CAT bachelor graduates were paid an average of $47,200, compared with the $45,300 earned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology mechanical engineering graduates. ``Graduates are not hired for diversity reasons or charity,'' says Reuss. ``They are hired because they are skilled workers with an excellent ethic.''

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, passed by the Senate yesterday, incorporates so many projects of importance to the Great Lakes region. I am especially pleased that so many of these projects serve to reinforce the pre-eminent leadership of the Chicago regional office in meeting the environmental responsibilities assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers in past reauthorizations of the Water Resources Development Act. 
   Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 incorporates a very important matter which I have considered a priority for some time. The subject is contaminated sediments and they are a potential threat to public and environmental health across the country. Persistent, bioaccumulative toxic substances in contaminated sediment can poison the food chain, making fish and shellfish unsafe for humans and wildlife to eat. Contamination of sediments can also interfere with recreational uses and increase the costs of and time needed for navigational dredging and subsequent disposal of dredged material. 
   Unfortunately, the resources of the federal government have not been brought to bear on these problems in a well coordinated fashion. Section 222 of this Act will require the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers to finally activate the National Contaminated Sediment Task Force that was mandated by the Water Resources Development Act of 1992. I am hopeful that convening this Task Force will encourage the Federal agencies to work together to combat this problem and create greater public awareness of the need to address contaminated sediments. We also need a better understanding of the quantities and sources of sediment contamination, to prevent recontamination and minimize the recurrence of these costs and impacts, and to get a handle on the extent of the public health threat. To that end, the Act requires the Task Force to report on the status of remedial action on contaminated sediments around the country, including a description of the authorities used in cleanup, the nature and sources of sediment contamination, the methods for determining the need for cleanup, the fate of dredged materials and barriers to swift remediation. 
   Mr. President, as the Democratic Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight several specific programs included in this bill which were developed through the bipartisan and bicameral cooperation of the members of this Task Force. Extension of cost-sharing rules to allow non-traditional partners such as non-profit organizations to partner with the Army Corps of Engineers on restoration activities will greatly expand the potential uses of these authorities in the Great Lakes basin (Sections 205 and 206). Section 224(2) will enhance the authority of the Corps to work cooperatively with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to make more efficient use of Corps' engineering expertise in constructing barriers and traps to reduce these aggressive invaders. Section 225 authorizes a special study on the watershed of the western basin of Lake Erie to enhance the integration of disparate elements of the Corps' program in this region. Section 223, the Great Lakes Basin Program incorporates three high-profile elements critical to the region as a whole which were developed through extensive negotiations among Task Force members at the end of the 105th Congress. 
   The first element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section 223a) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to develop a framework for their activities in the Great Lakes basin to be updated biennially. Many Army Corps of Engineers divisions have developed and use such strategic plans. Among other strengths, such plans allow greater programatic coordination--especially among projects conducted for such disparate purposes as navigation, environmental restoration, water quality, and flood control. Development of such a strategic plan for the Great Lakes basin has never been more important than at present, given the recent restructuring of the Army Corps of Engineers which leaves the Great Lakes and Ohio River division as the only Army Corps of Engineers division maintaining two regional offices (Chicago and Cincinnati). 
   The second element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section 223b) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to inventory existing information relevant to the Great Lakes biohydrological system and sustainable water use management. The Corps is to report to Congress, as well as to the International Joint Commission and the eight Great Lakes states, on the results of this inventory and recommendations on how to improve the information base. This information is crucial to the ongoing debate regarding attempts to export or divert Great Lakes surface and ground water out of the basin. The closely related provision, contained in subsection (e), on water use activities and policies, allows the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the Great Lakes states in development of interstate guidelines to improve consistency and efficiency of State-level water use activities and policies. 
   The third major element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section 223c) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to submit to Congress a report based on existing information detailing the economic benefits of recreational boating in the Great Lakes basin. As many of my colleagues may know, despite Congress' repeated objections, consecutive Administrations have unwisely sought to limit the Corps' role in dredging recreational harbors. Clearly these harbors' value to the regional economy should be recognized in the cost-benefit analyses used in making dredging decisions. For the Great Lakes region, dredging of these recreational harbors will be of increasing importance in the coming year as Great Lakes water levels decline from the high of the past several years. 
   Mr. President, I also wish to take a moment in closing to highlight the several specific projects included in the recently passed bill which will benefit my home state of Michigan. They include an Army Corps feasibility study of improvements to the Detroit River waterfront as part of the ongoing revitalization of the area. The Corps will prepare studies for flood control projects in St. Clair Shores and along the Saginaw River in Bay City. The Corps will consider reconstruction of the Hamilton Dam flood control project and review its denial of the city of Charlevoix's request for reimbursement of construction costs incurred in building a new revetment connection to the Federal navigation project at Charlevoix Harbor. Finally, the bill includes a unique provision which will allow the use of materials dredged from Toledo Harbor in Ohio for environmental restoration on the Woodtick Peninsula in Michigan. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee in incorporating these important provisions into this bill and look forward to working with them to get these important provisions signed into law.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. 
   Today, we will authorize the President of the United States to award the congressional gold medal to one of our Nation's greatest heroines, Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is the mother of the civil rights movement, and we are going to make this medal available and we are going to award this to her because of her extraordinary contributions to America. 
   Forty-three years ago, in December of 1955, an unassuming woman by the name of Rosa Parks decided she would not give up 
   her seat in the front of the bus and move to the back of the bus. It was not scheduled as a media event. It was not intended to be something which would spark a revolution. It, indeed, did spark an American revolution. It unleashed forces in this country, which are positive forces, which have added equal opportunity or fairer opportunity for African Americans and others who have been discriminated against for too many decades and centuries. 
   It was the act of an American citizen who just made a simple, straightforward decision that she is entitled equally to sit on a bus with any other person. She is not going to take an inferior position to anybody. She seeks no advantage over anyone else, but she will not accept an inferior status any longer on a public bus in Alabama. 
   The forces that set in motion have changed this Nation. It has changed this Nation for the better. It has forced us to confront centuries of discrimination against African Americans brought here as slaves and, even after slavery was abolished, too often treated as inferiors in a country that prides itself on treating all of its citizens equally and whose Constitution and Declaration of Independence held out a promise which had been thwarted and which was unfulfilled for our African American citizens. 
   Her arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day in 1955 was not an isolated incident but was actually part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and justice. Twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's bus-related segregation laws. That earlier law had required African Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus, then get off the bus and then get on the bus at the back to reboard the bus. As it happened, the driver of the bus in 1955 was the same driver who was driving the bus in 1943. The rest is history. 
   The boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African Americans and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. The Congressional Medal of Honor is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks, a gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and the demoralization of racial segregation. 
   Rosa Parks, as my friend from Michigan said, is a resident of Michigan, and we are very proud of it. We hope that is acknowledged in the final bill which comes out of the Congress. We are trying to add that fact to the final bill because, as it happens, since 1957, Rosa Parks has been a Michiganian. She and her husband made the journey to Michigan in 1957 because of threats on their lives and persistent harassment by phone. That is what prompted her move to Detroit where Rosa Parks' brother resided. 
   She continues to dedicate her life to advancing equal opportunity and to educating our youth about the past struggles for freedom, from slavery up to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 
   In 1987, Rosa Parks and Elaine Eason Steele cofounded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. Its primary focus has been working with young people in Michigan and from across the country and the world as part of the ``Pathways to Freedom'' program. The pathways program traces history from 
   the days of the underground railroad to the civil rights movement of the sixties and beyond. Through this institute, young people, ages 11 to 17, meet with national leaders and participate in a variety of educational and research projects. During the summer months in particular, many have the opportunity to travel across the country visiting historical sites. 
   In recent years, the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development has expanded to include an intergenerational mentoring and computer skills partnership program. This innovative program teams young people with elderly Americans. Generational and age barriers break down as young people help the elderly develop computer skills, while the elderly provide their unique and personalized recollections of their lives in American history. Each year, the institute matches hundreds of young people with elderly Americans. Since 1987, more than 7,000 youth from around the world have participated in this program. 
   With the work of her institute, we can truly say that in addition to having played a major role in shaping America's past and present, Rosa Parks is playing a major role in shaping America's future. With the dawn of a new millennium at hand, America must ensure that all of our youth are knowledgeable of one of the great national stories of our time and the struggle of African American individuals that finally forced us to honor the principles which founded this country and which had so long been rejected in the real world and in reality, even though they were promised on paper. 
   The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development ``Pathway to Freedom'' programs preserve the memories of self-sacrifice that African Americans, and so many others, have made to this country's development as truly the land of the free. 
   Madam President, this is great work which Rosa Parks continues to do. She continues to bless us, our Nation, our State with her presence, with her dignity, with her very direct, simple statement about equality. We hopefully will not just award her a medal one of these days, but we will also hopefully support the important work which she continues to do in her institute. 
   We have come a long way in achieving Dr. King's dream and Rosa Parks'  dream of justice and equality for all, but we still have a long ways to go. That is going to take a constant rededication to these goals and to the lifetime work of Rosa Parks and to the spirit of human rights which she so embodies and for which the name ``Rosa Parks'' stands. 
   I am proud to join Senator ABRAHAM and others, so many others, in this body and in the other body who have initiated this gold medal for her. We look forward to the day when we are actually able to present to one of the true champions of justice a gold medal which she so truly deserves. 
   I yield the floor and again thank my friend from Michigan.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am joining my good friend from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN, as a cosponsor of his bill to limit civil actions against a sitting President. The Supreme Court may have been right in its analysis in Clinton v. Jones that the separation of powers doctrine does not require immunity from civil suit for a sitting President, but it was wrong when it concluded that ``a deluge of such litigation will never engulf the Presidency,'' and when it went on to assert, ``if properly managed by the District Court, it appears to us highly unlikely [for the Paula Jones civil suit] to occupy any substantial amount of petitioner's time.'' 
   No one can reasonably believe that President Clinton didn't spend a significant amount of his time preparing his defense in the Paula Jones case. Moreover, we can all understand how the existence of such a case can be a significant distraction and preoccupation even when it is not being worked on directly. 
   The Supreme Court recognized in its decision in Clinton v. Jones the all-consuming nature of the responsibilities of being President of the United States. The Court wrote:  
   ``As a starting premise, petitioner [the President] contends that he occupies a unique office with powers and responsibilities so vast and important that the public interest demands that he devote his undivided time and attention to his public duties . . . We have no dispute with the initial premise of the argument. Former presidents, from George Washington to George Bush, have consistently endorsed petitioner's characterization of the office. After serving his term, Lyndon Johnson observed: ``Of all the 1,886 nights I was President, there were not many when I got to sleep before 1 or 2 A.M., and there were few mornings when I didn't wake up by 6 or 6:30.''  
   Being President of the United States is a 24 hour a day job. That's both necessary and desirable. To allow the President to be sued for matters arising from acts committed prior to his taking office makes the President vulnerable to mischievous, possibly politically-motivated and time-consuming litigation. As the leader of our country and the most important political leader in the world, I don't want the President's attention diverted from the many important and consequential responsibilities of the office to defend against lawsuits based on allegations of conduct before the President ran for office and which could have therefore been filed prior to his taking office. That's why I support limiting the involvement of sitting Presidents in civil litigation. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has taken the first step in addressing this problem. His bill would bar the President from participating in any civil trial involving the President as plaintiff or defendant but would permit discovery to the extent it is carried out with ``due deference to Presidential responsibilities'' and using ``reasonable case management principles.'' The bill would allow a civil suit to be filed and limited discovery to occur, but would not allow a President to proceed to trial as either a plaintiff or defendant. Senator MOYNIHAN has made a thoughtful proposal. However, I prefer that the bill be limited to only those civil cases brought with respect to matters that occurred before the President assumed office or before the President participated in the general election; I would not want to affect cases brought against Presidents for actions they have taken while President in their official capacity. There are a significant number of cases against every President for actions taken during their term in office, and I don't believe we can or should immunize the President from those types of cases. For example, President Truman was sued when he seized the steel plants. President Carter was sued over his decision to return the Panama Canal to Panama. President Reagan was sued regarding the role of America in El Salvador, and President Bush was sued for various matters relating to the Persian Gulf War. I am not commenting on the validity of these suits, I am only saying that such suits should not be disallowed since they are brought against the President in his or her official capacity and they are handled not by the President but by the Department of Justice and White House Legal Counsel. Another class of cases that should be permitted while a President is in office are domestic cases--those related to or involving personal family relationships such as the resolution of a will or an estate or child support. 
   The Supreme Court reported that only three sitting Presidents have been defendants in civil suits involving their actions prior to taking office. These were Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman whose cases were dismissed before they took office, and John F. Kennedy, whose case was settled once he took office. Given the increasing litigious nature of our society, we cannot rely on this history to project what may happen in the future. And given the recent experience of President Clinton and the Paula Jones case, we know the enormous consequences just one such case can have. 
   I look forward to working with Senator MOYNIHAN on this legislation and to getting it enacted in this Congress, before the next President takes office in the year 2001.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are all keenly aware of the demands that we place on our troops, the circumstances in which they must live and work, and the unique sacrifices that they make to serve our country. Filing tax returns is a duty we all must bear to support our nation, but it is particularly difficult for service members overseas, who face this burden thousands of miles from home and without the resources and assistance available to the rest of us. When those troops are placed in harms' way, the burden becomes immeasurably greater. 
   Earlier this year, Senator COVERDELL and I introduced S. 767, the Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act of 1999. This bill would have extended by two months the date by which members of the uniformed services on duty abroad must file their Federal income tax returns. Current Treasury regulations provide for an automatic two month extension for U.S. citizens and residents on military duty outside of the United States. S. 767 would have codified this regulation into law, thereby ensuring that members of the military would not be subject to fines and penalties when they avail themselves of this relief. 
   This week, the President addressed the same problem by issuing an executive order designating the Kosovo area of operations as a ``combat zone'' for the purpose of tax relief benefits. This designation will provide the following benefits: 
   The deadline for filing and paying taxes will be extended; 
   Military pay for months served in the combat zone will be exempt from income taxes; and 
   Telephone calls out of the combat zone will be exempt from the telephone excise tax. 
   Today, the Senate will pass and send to the President a House bill that is a companion measure to bill that Senator COVERDELL and I introduced earlier this year. This bill shows Congress' support for the President's decision by codifying this executive order into law. In addition, the bill extends the area covered by the exemption to include not only aircrews flying missions into the combat zone, but also members of the armed forces supporting those operations in the area of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the Adriatic Sea, and the northern Ionian Sea. I think we all know the dangers and hardships that our troops in these areas are facing on a daily basis, and want to support them in any way we can. 
   I am pleased that Congress, by enacting this bill, will join the President in showing support for our men and women in combat. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the enactment of this legislation.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Henry S. Landau on receiving the Humanitarian Award of the Jewish Federation of Washtenaw County, Michigan. Mr. Landau is being honored by the Jewish Federation as a ``builder of our future,'' because of the outstanding work he has done to establish programs and institutions to provide education and job training in the community. 
   Henry Landau has served his community, state, and country in countless ways. He served as a trustee of Washtenaw Community College from 1976 to 1982. He also served as chair of the Washtenaw Community College Foundation and was later honored by the college with a lifetime achievement award and an endowed scholarship. Mr. Landau was a Senior Life Director of the National Association of Home Builders and a trustee of the Home Builders Institute. Mr. Landau also served as President of the Michigan Association of Home Builders and was a board member for eighteen years. 
   Henry Landau was instrumental in establishing a unique and innovative program in the Ann Arbor Public School System to teach high school students about the building trades by allowing them to build an actual home. This successful program continues and is now financed through the sale of the homes built by students. The construction industry later honored Mr. Landau's efforts with the H.S. Landau Scholarship, which is awarded annually and benefits a graduate of the Ann Arbor student building program. 
   Mr. President, I have mentioned only a small sampling of the many ways in which Henry Landau has used his vitality, creativity and hard work to make his community and our nation a better place to live. I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Henry Landau for  his many extraordinary efforts on behalf of his community.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. This legislation will strengthen SBA's women's business centers in Michigan and across the Nation which help entrepreneurs start and maintain successful businesses by providing such things as start-up help and financial expertise to women-owned businesses. This legislation will allow those women's business centers that are already successfully participating in the program to recompete for Federal funding after their initial funding term expires. 
   Under this legislation, the recompetition standards would be set higher than those used for centers applying for their initial five-year funding term. The ability of established and successful women's business development centers to continue to compete for Federal funding means that critical resources will continue to be made available for women-owned businesses for such purposes as training and obtaining business financing. 
   Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of small businesses in America and provide innumerable jobs and resources to the state of Michigan. Michigan has two women's business centers, the Center for Empowerment and Economic Development (CEED) in Ann Arbor and the Grand Rapids Opportunities for Women (GROW) in Grand Rapids. We also have Project Invest in Traverse City which is a women's business center affiliate. In addition, a Center is currently being set up in Detroit. 
   These Michigan programs offer women a comprehensive package of business education and training, start-up financing, technical assistance, peer group support and access to community and government supportive resources such as child care. Michigan's women's business centers are supportive of this legislation and believe it is necessary in order for them to continue to be able to offer the current levels of services and support to Michigan's women-owned businesses. 
   I am pleased that Congress has recognized the importance of funding the women's business center program. In 1997, Congress enacted legislation to make the 1991 pilot project a permanent part of the Small Business Administration programs available to help entrepreneurs start and maintain successful business. It also doubled the annual funding of the women's business centers and extended the funding period from 3 to 5 years. And just this year, Congress enacted legislation to change the non-Federal and Federal funding ratio requirements and it again increased the annual authorization level from $8 million to $11 million. 
   The legislation being introduced today by my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. KERRY, in addition to allowing existing women's business centers to compete for additional Federal funding, will also increase the authorized appropriations for fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 from $11 million to $12 million for this program.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Latin-Americans for Social and Economic Development, Inc. (LA SED.) LA SED, a remarkable organization in my home state of Michigan, will celebrate its 30th Anniversary on May 5, 1999. 
   For thirty years now, LA SED has served Hispanics and the residents of Southwest Detroit through broad-based social programs. While championing the welfare of the Latino community, it has also addressed the issues that affect the diverse ethnic populations in Southwest Detroit. From education to advocacy and much more, LA SED's far-reaching hand has helped thousands of Detroit's most deserving citizens achieve a higher standard of living. 
   Over the years, LA SED has grown to become one of Detroit's premier multi-purpose social service agencies. As it celebrates this important milestone, I am sure its staff, friends and supporters will have the opportunity to recall its many successes. I am pleased to join with them in thanking LA SED for its efforts while applauding all the hard work and determination that have resulted in its prestigious reputation. 
   Mr. President, LA SED can take pride in the many important achievements of its first thirty years. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting the accomplishments of LA SED's first three decades and in wishing it continued success for the future.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with Senators ABRAHAM, ROBB, HELMS, and FEINGOLD, the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act. This bill, if enacted, would eliminate the requirement for Federal agencies to purchase products made by Federal Prison Industries and require FPI to compete commercially for Federal contracts. It would implement a key recommendation of the Vice President's National Performance Review, which concluded that we should ``Take away the Federal Prison Industries' status as a mandatory source of federal supplies and require it to compete commercially for Federal agencies' business.'' Most importantly, it would ensure that the taxpayers get the best possible value for their federal procurement dollars. 
   Mr. President, Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that it provides a quality product at a price that is competitive with current market prices. Indeed, the Federal Prison Industries statute requires them to do so. That statute states, and I quote, that FPI may provide to Federal agencies products that ``meet their requirements'' at prices that do not ``exceed current market prices.'' 
   Indeed, FPI would appear to have a significant advantage in any head-to-head competition, since FPI pays inmates less than $2 an hour, far below the minimum wage and a small fraction of the wage paid to most private sector workers in competing industries. 
   The taxpayers also provide a direct subsidy to Federal Prison Industries products by picking up the cost of feeding, clothing, and housing the inmates who provide the labor. There is no reason why we should provide an indirect subsidy as well, by requiring Federal agencies to purchase products from FPI even when they are more expensive and of a lower quality than competing commercial items. 
   Yet, FPI remains unwilling to compete with the private sector, or even to permit Federal agencies to compare their products and prices with those available in the private sector. Indeed, FPI recently published a proposed rule which would expressly prohibit Federal agencies from conducting market research, as they would ordinarily do, to determine whether the price and quality of FPI products is comparable to what is available in the commercial marketplace. Instead, federal agencies are required to contact FPI, which will act as the sole arbiter of whether the product meets the agency's requirements. The proposed rule states:  
   A contracting activity should not solicit bids, proposals, quotations, or otherwise test the market for the purpose of seeking alternative sources to FPI....... the contracting officer or activity should contact FPI, and FPI will determine ..... whether an agency's requirement can be met by FPI.  
   The reason for FPI's position is obvious: it is much easier to gain market share by fiat than it is to compete for business. Under FPI's current interpretation of the law, it need not offer the best product at the best price; it is sufficient for it to offer an adequate product at an adequate price, and insist upon its right to make the sale. Indeed, FPI currently advertises that it offers federal agencies ``ease in purchasing'' through ``a procurement with no bidding necessary.'' 
   The result of the FPI's status as a mandatory source is not unlike the result of other sole-source contracting: the taxpayers frequently pay too much  and receive an inferior product for their money. When FPI sets its prices, it does not even attempt to match the best price available in the commercial sector; instead, it claims to have charged a ``market price'' whenever it can show that at least some vendors in the private sector charges as high a price. As GAO reported in August 1998, ``The only limit the law imposes on FPI's price is that it may not exceed the upper end of the current market price range.'' 
   Yet, FPI appears to have had difficulty providing even this minimal protection for the taxpayer. GAO compared FPI prices for 20 representative products to private vendors' catalog or actual prices for the same or comparable products and found that for 4 of these products, FPI's price was higher than the price offered by any private vendor. Moreover, for five of the remaining products, FPI's price was at the ``high end of the range'' of prices offered by private vendors--ranking sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth of the ten vendors reviewed, respectively. In other words, for almost half of the FPI products reviewed, the FPI approach appeared to be to charge the highest price possible, rather than the lowest price possible, to the Federal customer. 
   One example of FPI overpricing was presented in a December 19, 1997 letter that I received from a frustrated vendor. The vendor stated:  
   If the Air Force would purchase a completed unit as described in UNICOR's solicitation directly from a ....... manufacturer we estimate the cost will be approximately $6,500.00. UNICOR is going to purchase a kit for $9,259.00 and add their assembly and administrative costs to the unit. If UNICOR only adds $1500.00 to the total cost of the unit, it will cost the Air Force $10,759.00. This is 66 percent higher than the current market price. If the Air Force purchases 8,000 units over the next five years it will cost the taxpayers an additional $34,072,000.00 over what it would cost if they dealt directly with a manufacturer.  
   A second frustrated vendor reported a similar experience to me. The vendor's letter stated:  
   [FPI] bid on this item and simply because [FPI] did, I was told that the award had to be given to [FPI]. [FPI] won the bid at $45 per unit. My company bid $22 per unit. The way I see it, the government just overspent my tax dollars to the tune of $1,978. The total amount of my bid was less than that. Do you seriously believe that this type of procurement is cost-effective? 
   I lost business, and my tax dollars were misused because of unfair procurement practices mandated by federal regulations. This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, of how the procurement system is being misused and small businesses in this country are being excluded from competition, with the full support of federal regulations and the seeming approval of Congress. It is far past the time to curtail this `company' known as Federal prison Industries and require them to be competitive for the benefit of all taxpayers.  
   This kind of overpricing has a real and dramatic impact on the ability of the Department of Defense to purchase the products that they need to provide for the national defense and for the welfare of our men and women in uniform. For example, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy testified before the House National Security Committee on July 30, 1996, and the FPI monopoly on government furniture contracts has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its sailors. Master Chief Petty Officer John Hagan stated, and I quote:  
   Speaking frankly, the [FPI] product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. [FPI] has, in my opinion, exploited their special status instead of making changes which would make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need your support to change the law and have FPI compete with [private sector] furniture manufacturers [under GSA contracts]. Without this change, we will not be serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and efficient way.  
   Mr. President, I do not consider my self to be an enemy of Federal Prison Industries. I am a strong supporter of the idea of putting federal inmates to work. I understand that a strong prison work program not only reduces inmate idleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work ethic, provide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to product society upon their release. 
   However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a manner that is sensitive to the need not to unfairly eliminate the jobs of hard-working citizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able to achieve this result only if it diversifies its product lines and avoids the temptation to build its workforce by continuing to displace private sector jobs in its traditional lines of work. For this reason, I have been working since 1990 to try to help Federal Prison Industries to identify new markets that it can expand into without displacing private sector jobs. 
   Mr. President, avoiding competition is the easy way out, but it isn't the right way for FPI, it isn't the right way for the private sector workers whose jobs FPI is taking, and it isn't the right way for the taxpayer, who will continue to pay more and get less as a result of the mandatory preference for FPI goods. We need to have jobs for prisoners, but can no longer afford to allow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and when it will take them. Competition will be better for FPI, better for the taxpayer, and better for working men and women around the country.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the budget resolution which the majority has presented to the Senate. In my judgement, this budget represents the wrong priorities. It places  too great an emphasis on tax breaks which largely benefit the wealthiest among us and too little on the protection of Medicare. 
   Just six years ago, the nation was faced with annual deficits of more than $300 billion as far as the eye could see. In 1993, President Clinton presented and Congress approved by one vote in each House a deficit reduction plan that continues to pay dividends. Instead of billions of dollars of federal deficits, surpluses are forecast for the next fifteen years. This is a remarkable accomplishment. It presents us with the opportunity to make critical investments in the nation's future and to reduce the national debt. However, we must act wisely. 
   We have seen many federal budget estimates, and we know well that as quickly as these surpluses appeared, they could disappear. The estimates of both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget have frequently been far off the mark in recent years. That is not their fault. We have some of the brightest economists in the country working at CBO and at OMB and they do a very good job, but they have a difficult task to do. Forecasting the performance of the economy, particularly over the course of several years is more art than science. For instance, last August CBO estimated that the unified budget surplus for fiscal year 2000 was $79 billion. Just four months later in a January 1999 CBO document, the surplus for fiscal year 2000 is estimated at $130 billion. This is a change of over 60% in just four months and early indications are that in August the surplus amounts will rise even higher. I believe that if most Americans were confronted with such uncertainty over their own budget situation, they would recommend a cautious course. I agree. 
   The President has established the framework for this new budget debate by his determination to strengthen Social Security. There is no more important or effective program. Two-thirds of those who collect Social Security rely on it for more than 50% of their income. The President's plan to save Social Security through debt retirement is largely intact in this resolution. This is a significant victory for the President and the American people, and it has broad support in the Senate. I look forward to supporting the legislation to implement this policy of debt reduction . 
   Unfortunately, the majority party has not included the President's policy of debt reduction to shore up Medicare in this resolution. The President set aside fifteen percent of the surplus for Medicare, but this resolution does not. This omission is crucial when one considers that although Social Security is already solvent through 2033, Medicare is solvent only until 2008. We all know how important the Medicare program is. Today the Medicare program provides health care to 39 million Americans. By 2032, the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double to 78 million as the baby boomers retire. Considering these demographics, it is unwise not to use part of our current budget surplus to help shore up the Medicare program, which will also need structural reforms. Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us does not shore up existing commitments to Medicare and our seniors. Instead this resolution takes us back to the bad old days of backloaded tax breaks whose real costs explode several years after enactment. For example, the GOP tax plan uses $177 billion of the surplus in the first five years after enactment and actually has no cost in the first year. But, in the second five years, the cost of the tax cut more than triples to $664 billion. This budgetary time bomb is set go off at the same time as the Medicare trust fund is expected to be bankrupt. Senator KENNEDY's amendment, which I supported, would have set aside part of the surplus for the Medicare trust fund and avoided this outcome. The KENNEDY amendment was defeated. The Republican majority, unfortunately, seems headed yet again this year for a showdown with the President and Democrats in the Congress over the budget.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator THOMPSON, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999. This is the same legislation we developed in the last Congress, and it includes the changes we agreed to last year with the Administration. This is the legislation the President has agreed to sign if we present it to him in this form. And I am hopeful we can get it to him this year and get these important processes enacted into law. Senator THOMPSON and I are pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators VOINOVICH, ROBB, ABRAHAM, ROCKEFELLER, ROTH, DASCHLE, STEVENS, MOYNIHAN, COCHRAN, BREAUX, FRIST, ENZI, GRAMS, GRASSLEY, and LINCOLN. 
   The Regulatory Improvement Act would put into law basic requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules and executive oversight of the rulemaking process. 
   Mr. President, I've fought for regulatory reform since 1979, the year I came to the Senate. As for an overall regulatory reform bill, I've supported such legislation since 1980, when the Senate first passed S. 1080, the Laxalt Leahy bill only to have it die later that year in the House. Those of us who believe in the benefits of regulation to protect health and safety have a particular responsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible and cost-effective. When they aren't, the regulatory process--which is so vital to our health and well being--comes under constant attack and the regulations which we count on to protect us fail to achieve the maximum effectiveness. We miss the opportunity to do more with the resources we have. By requiring a regulatory process that is open and requires agencies to use good science and common sense, we immunize that process from attack and improve the quality of our regulations. 
   Based on the principles of better cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, more flexibility for the regulated industries to reach legislative goals in a variety of ways, more cooperative efforts between government and industry and less ``us versus them'' attitudes, Senator THOMPSON and I, in cooperation with the Administration, have developed this bill. 
   Let me highlight some important features of this legislation. 
   The bill would put into statute requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules and executive oversight of the rulemaking process. It requires agencies to do a cost-benefit analysis when issuing rules that cost $100 million, or are otherwise designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) as having other significant impacts. The agency must determine whether the benefits of the rule justify its costs; whether the rule is more cost-effective, or provides greater net benefits, than other regulatory options considered by the agency; and whether the rule adopts a flexible regulatory option. If the agency determines that the rule does not do so, the agency is required to explain the reasons why it selected the rule, including any statutory provision that required the agency to select the rule. 
   We say right from the beginning, in the section on findings, that cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful tools to help agencies issue reasonable regulations. However, as we explicitly state, they do not replace the need for good judgment and the agencies' consideration of social values in deciding when and how to regulate. 
   The bill requires an agency issuing a major rule to evaluate the benefits and costs of a ``reasonable number of reasonable alternatives reflecting the range of regulatory options that would achieve the objective of the statute as addressed by the rulemaking.'' The bill doesn't require an agency to look at all the possible alternatives, just a reasonable number; but it does require the agency to pick a selection of options that are available to it within the range of the rulemaking objective. 
   We define benefits very broadly. Nothing in this bill suggests that the only benefits assessed by an agency should be quantifiable. On the contrary, this bill 
   explicitly recognizes that many important benefits may be nonquantifiable, and that agencies have the right and authority to fully consider such benefits when doing the cost-benefit analysis and when determining whether the benefits justify the costs. 
   If the rule involves a risk to health, safety or the environment, the bill requires the agency to do a quality risk assessment to analyze the benefits of the rule. All required risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses for rules costing $500 million would undergo independent peer review. During the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, the rulemaking agency is required to consider substitution risks--that is, risks that could be expected to result from the implementation of the regulatory option selected by the agency--and to compare the risk being regulated with other risks with which the public may be familiar. 
   The risk assessment requirement establishes basic elements for performing risk assessments, many of which will provide transparency for an agency's development of a rule, and it requires guidelines for such assessments to be issued by OIRA in consultation with the Office of Science and Technology Policy. 
   Peer review is required by this bill for both cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments, but only once per rule. Peer review is not required at both the proposed and final rule stages. 
   The cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations, and risk assessment are required to be included in the rulemaking record and to be considered by the court, to the extent relevant, only in determining whether the final rule is arbitrary and capricious. In addition, if the agency fails to perform the cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment or peer review, the court may remand or invalidate the rule, giving due regard to prejudicial error, and in any event shall order the agency to perform the missing assessment or analysis. 
   The bill codifies the review procedure now conducted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and requires public disclosure of OIRA's review process. 
   Finally, the bill requires the Director of OMB to contract for a study on the comparison of risks to human health, safety and the environment and a study to develop a common basis for risk communication with respect to carcinogens and noncarcinogens and the incorporation of risk assessments into cost-benefit analyses. 
   Mr. President, the cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments required by the bill are intended to be transparent to the public. Agencies should not hide the important information that forms the basis of their regulatory actions.  
   Another important provision of this bill is the one that requires the agency to make a reasonable determination whether the benefits of the rule justify the costs and whether the regulatory option selected by the agency is substantially likely to achieve the objective of the rulemaking in a more cost effective manner or with greater net benefits than the other regulatory options considered by the agency. This is not in any way a decisional criteria that the agency must meet. If, as the agency is free to do, it chooses a regulatory option where the benefits do not justify the costs or that is not more cost effective or does not provide greater net benefits than the other options, the agency is required to explain why it did what it did and list the factors that caused it to do so. Those factors could be a statute, a policy judgment, uncertainties in the data and the like. There is no added judicial scrutiny of a rule provided for or intended by this section. The final rule must still stand or fall based on whether the court finds that the rule is arbitrary or capricious in light of the whole rulemaking record. That is the current standard of judicial review. 
   The bill says that if an agency ``cannot'' make the determinations required by the bill, it has to say why it can't. Use of the word ``cannot'' does not mean that an agency rule can be overturned by a court for its failure to pick an option that would permit the agency to make the determinations required by the bill. The agency is free to use its discretion to regulate under the substantive statute, and there is no implication that such rule must meet the standards described in the determinations subsection. This legislation requires only that the agency be up 
   front with the public as to just how cost-beneficial and cost-effective its regulatory proposal is. 
   Judicial review has been of great concern to those of us who want real regulatory reform without bottling up important regulations in the courts. There is no judicial review permitted of the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment required by this bill outside of judicial review of the final rule. The analysis and assessment are included in the rulemaking record, but there is no judicial review of the content of those items or the procedural steps followed or not followed by the agency in the development the analysis or assessment. Only the total failure to actually do the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment would allow the court to remand the rule to the agency. 
   Finally, as I noted, the bill reflects agreement with the Administration. Among the key aspects of that agreement are added clarification on the avoidance of a so-called ``supermandate;'' clarification of the provisions for peer review; and deletion of provisions that would have required periodic reviews of existing rules. 
   So those are some highlights. A hearing on the bill in the Governmental Affairs Committee is planned for April. 
   We are pleased that we have the support of the state and local government organizations, namely the National Governor's Association, the National League of Cities, the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National Association of Counties, as well as dozens of business organizations, the school boards, state environmental directors, and leading experts and scholars across the country. 
   I feel strongly that this bill will improve the regulatory process, will build confidence in the regulatory programs that are so important to this society's well-being, and will result in better, more protective regulations because we will be directing our resources in more cost-effective ways.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Wayne County Medical Society, which is celebrating its sesquicentennial anniversary on April 14, 1999. The Wayne County Medical Society has been an important part of the Metro Detroit community for the past 150 years. 
   The Wayne County Medical Society was formed in 1849 with 50 physicians, who committed themselves to providing the best quality medical care to the people of Wayne County. The Society has been engaged in many important public health campaigns throughout its history. One of the most notable examples was the Society's massive polio immunization drive of 1964, led by Dr. Francis P. Rhoades, which virtually eliminated the disease from the City of Detroit. 
   Today, the 4,200 members of the Wayne County Medical Society work together to provide free health care services for people in need. The Society maintains a free medical and dental clinic in Detroit, where needy children receive physical exams, health education and dental treatment. The Society also sponsors an annual Christmas party for children in foster care. In 1998, the Wayne County Medical Society held a conference for more than 500 Detroit Public School children on the subject of teen pregnancy. In addition to its public service endeavors, the Society encourages excellence in health care by offering Continuing Medical Education credits to its members and by joining with the Michigan State Medical Society and the American Medical Association to promote issues of importance to the medical community at large. 
   Mr. President, the Wayne County Medical Society has been a valued member of the Metro Detroit community since 1849. I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking the members of the Society for their commitment, and in wishing them continued success as they address the health needs of the 21st century.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Knights of Columbus Council 414, of Bay City, Michigan. Council 414 is celebrating its 100th anniversary on April 16, 1999. 
   The history of the Knights of Columbus stretches back 117 years, when Father Michael J. McGivney founded the fraternal order in 1882. Since the order's founding, Knights of Columbus have promoted the Catholic faith and have practiced the principles of charity, unity and fraternity. When Father McGivney passed away in 1890, there were 5,000 Knights of Columbus located in 57 councils in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Just 15 years after his death, the Knights of Columbus was established in every state of the union, as well as in Canada, Mexico and the Philippines. 
   Bay City Council 414, known then as Valley Council 414, was established in 1899, 17 years after the founding of the order by Father McGivney. It is the third oldest Knights of Columbus council in the State of Michigan. The driving force behind the founding of Council 414 was Edward J. Schreiber. He and 48 other men were responsible for establishing Council 414's charter, which was issued on April 16, 1899. 
   Since its chartering, Council 414 has helped to establish other Knights of Columbus councils in the area, and has participated in the many community service activities for which the Knights of Columbus are renowned. Perhaps most notably, Council 414's members raise money each year in ``Tootsie Roll Drives'' to support organizations like Special Olympics, the Bay Arenac School District and special education programs. 
   Mr. President, the members of the Knights of Columbus Council 414 of Bay City, Michigan, are truly deserving of recognition for their century-long dedication to promoting the teachings of the Catholic Church, and for living those teachings by serving those in need in their community. I hope my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations to Council 414's members on its 100th anniversary, and in wishing them continued success in their next 100 years.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cosponsor this resolution because, year after year, we have asked Europe to take the lead before we are leading in their own back yard, to become united, to take care of troubles before they spread. They have done so. They are now waiting for us. It has been asked, will our European allies stay with us? That is not the question. The question is whether we will now join our European allies who are waiting for us to sound a clear call that we will not permit ethnic cleansing to spread to destabilize a region and to destabilize Europe. 
   The stakes here are huge. The objective here, we should be very clear, is to reduce the military capability of Milosevic to ``ethnically cleanse'' Kosovo and thereby touch off a broader war and massive instability in Europe. That is our military objective--to reduce that military capability to ethnically cleanse Kosovo. 
   If we had acted earlier in Bosnia, we could have avoided that genocide. We did not act. NATO has now decided to act, and it is the future stability of Europe which we are going to help determine here tonight, as well as the support for our troops. It was asked of the President, ``Request our support, Mr. President.'' We heard that at the White House over and over again. The President has now requested our support. Our military leaders have set forth a clear military objective. They have done so before the Armed Services Committee. They have done so before other committees and each of us. So now it is up to us to decide whether or not we will support our troops, and whether we will support NATO. The risks of not acting are greater than the risks of acting. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is important for the United States to participate in NATO air and missile strikes. NATO is ready to act because of the threat that the conflict in Kosovo could spread to the neighboring countries of Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia and could involve nations such as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, and to prevent a humanitarian disaster. 
   I believe the military mission for our forces should be clearly and carefully stated as to reduce the military capability of the Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army to ethnically cleanse Kosovo and touch off a broader war and major instability in Europe. 
   It is tempting and would be easy to justify NATO action against the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army forces as a way to punish Milosevic. He has destroyed the economy of former Yugoslavia; shut down its independent media; ousted all democracy-learning professors from its universities and substituted his cronies; has threatened President Djukanovic of the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, who favors democracy and a free market economy; has seized privately-owned property, including property owned by an American citizen; and has violated every agreement he has ever made, including, in particular, the Dayton Peace Accords and the October 12, 1998 agreement with Richard Holbrooke. 
   But it is the threat to regional peace and security that justifies NATO air strikes. 
   The United States is the leader of NATO and the credibility of NATO is on the line; the future stability of Europe is on the line; and the ethnic cleansing of the population of Kosovo is on the line. With all of these important interests on the line, I believe the United States must do its part, in cooperation with our NATO allies, to carry out air operations and missile strikes to reduce the military capability of the Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army to ethnically cleanse Kosovo and touch off a broader war and create major instability in Europe. 
   I have been a strong supporter of the development of the European Security and Defense Identity within NATO and I want to take particular note of the role that our NATO allies have been and are playing with respect to Kosovo. First of all, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or OSCE--a European dominated Organization of 55 nations--stepped up to the plate and established the Kosovo Verification Mission or KVM. The KVM has as its mission the monitoring of compliance with the October 1998 agreement negotiated between Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic. 
   Because the OSCEs KVM is unarmed, NATO established an Extraction Force, which, as the name implies, is designed to come to the aid of KVM personnel and to remove them from situations in which their safety might be imperiled. The Extraction Force is led by a French general and is made up entirely of forces provided by our NATO allies. The United States has provided 2 military personnel to serve in the Extraction Force headquarters, but no combat forces. Once again, our NATO allies delivered. 
   When NATO was planning for a ground force to implement an interim peace agreement in Kosovo with the consent of the parties, it was decided that approximately 28,000 troops would be needed. Our NATO allies agreed to provide more than 24,000 troops. The United States would contribute less than 4,000 troops to that force. The on-scene commander for the force would have been a British general. The force contribution of our NATO allies would dominate the force. Once again, our NATO allies delivered. And the foreign ministers of Great Britian and France co-chaired the negotiations that provided the opportunity for a peaceful settlement of this crisis. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to describe my visit to Kosovo in November. In the course of that visit, I accompanied a U.S. Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission team on its daily tour that stopped in the village of Malisevo. Malisevo was a ghost town. The Kosovar Albanians who had previously lived there were afraid to return because of the damage that had been caused by the Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army and the continuing presence of Serbian police forces in the village. In 
   order to conceal the extent of the destruction they had wrought, the Serbian forces had bulldozed a large square block of the village and carted off the debris. The bullet and shell holes in the remaining structures bore silent witness to the cruel way in which President Slobodan Milosevic's forces punished the civilian population in response to the resistance of the Kosovo Liberation Army or KLA. 
   Kosovo is the scene of a horrendous humanitarian disaster. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated last week that at least 230,000 persons were displaced within Kosovo as a result of the conflict and a further 170,000 have fled from Kosovo in the past year. That adds up to a total of about 400,000 people who had fled their homes. That number increases on a daily basis as Milosevic's forces continue their rampage. 
   During my visit to Kosovo, I met with the political representative of the KLA, Adem Demaci, with the elected President of the Kosovo shadow government, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, and with the editor of the Albanian language newspaper Koha Ditore, Veton Surroi. 
   My meeting with Adem Demaci, the then political representative of the KLA, who was first arrested in 1958 and, by his own admission has been fighting for Kosovo independence, ever since, had spent 28 years in Yugoslav jails for his campaign for independence for Kosovo, involved a friendly and occasionally heated discussion. He stated that he could not endorse any agreement that did not have a guarantee that the ethnic Albanians could decide their own future after three years. Mr. Demaci resigned his position in protest when Kosovar Albanian negotiators' agreed in principle to the agreement at Rambouillet.  
   Dr. Rugova, who has consistently espoused a policy of peaceful resistance, stated his preference for the agreement to provide a mechanism for the people to express their will at the end of three years but was flexible on that point since he was committed to reaching an agreement that would stablize the situation. Dr. Rugova and a number of his lieutenants participated as part of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team that went to Rambouillet. 
   Veton Surroi, who has courageously published an independent newspaper in Pristina, the capitol of Kosovo, expressed his concern about achieving an agreement in view of the difficulty he anticipated in reconciling the positions of the KLA and the Rugova camp. He was not optimistic. He also participated in the Rambouillet negotiations as a member of the ethnic Albanian team. 
   Mr. President, despite the Kosovar Albanians strong desire for independence, a goal which is supported by the international community and is not provided for by the Interim Peace Agreement, they signed that Agreement. The Yugoslav delegation, by contrast, has stonewalled and, as characterized by Mr. Verdine and Mr. Cook as co-chairmen of the negotiations, ``has tried to unravel the Rambouillet Accords.'' And Slobodan Milosevic, when given a final chance to avoid NATO air and missile attacks, stubbornly continued his ethnic cleaning of Kosovo. 
   I will support the resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Delaware. His leadership is what carried this resolution to a bipartisan conclusion, along with the Senator from Virginia. I pay particular, really, homage to both of them. This is a very difficult vote for all of us, whichever side of this resolution we voted on. It is very important it be a bipartisan vote. It is important to our troops, first and foremost. It is important we send a bipartisan message to Milosevic so there not be any misunderstanding or miscalculation. The leaders in the effort to do that were the first two names on that resolution, and they are Senators BIDEN and WARNER. 
   I commend them for their leadership.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along with my colleagues, Senators FEINSTEIN and BRYAN, that will protect consumers from the unscrupulous practice known as ``title washing'' the current practice of selling rebuilt wrecks to unsuspecting buyers. The objective of this legislation is to make it more difficult for unscrupulous auto sellers to conceal the fact that a vehicle has been in an accident by transferring the vehicle's title in a state with lower standards than where the vehicle is ultimately sold. 
   In developing this bill, Senators FEINSTEIN and BRYAN and I worked closely with national consumer protection groups and a number of state Attorneys General. We have crafted a bill that is truly consumer protective and sets high national standards that did not previously exist. We took great care to ensure that our bill would not preempt the rights of states to retain or enact laws that exceed the minimum federal standards in this bill. 
   National automobile salvage title legislation is needed because there is no uniform standard for when a vehicle must be declared salvage or nonrepairable. About 2.5 million cars are severely damaged in auto accidents each year. More than half of them are returned to the road. Many of these rebuilt cars are sold to unsuspecting consumers without disclosure of the car's prior history, increasing the chance of serious injury to the drivers and passengers of these rebuilt cars. The National Association of Attorneys General estimates that the sale of rebuilt or salvaged motor vehicles as undamaged, costs the motor vehicle industry and consumers up to $4 billion annually. 
   Currently, some states, like Michigan and California and others, have tough consumer protection laws dictating when a vehicle's title must be branded as salvage or nonrepairable, but other states do not. Unfortunately, unscrupulous people now take advantage of this lack of uniformity and take wrecked vehicles to states with low or no standards to retitle them and thus wipe out the vehicle's prior damage history. 
   Our bill would provide for uniform standards of nationwide seller disclosure for every vehicle sale of previous salvage and major damage vehicles, and ensure these title brands are carried forward with all titles each time  the vehicle is sold. This proposal is consistent with the National Association of Attorneys General auto salvage resolution adopted in 1994. 
   This bill also has the support of Michigan's Attorney General, who wrote in a letter endorsing the bill,  
   This bill will further empower consumers to have more information available in making an informed decision about what is generally their second most costly purchase, motor vehicles used for personal transportation. I urge Congress to enact this bill.  
   The salvage title requirements in our bill are modeled after the successful 25 year old federal odometer law which requires the milage of a vehicle to be disclosed before a vehicle can be transferred. This law requires each seller to fill out a statement on the odometer reading that verifies its accuracy and a vehicle buyer cannot get a state title without this disclosure on the title. Our bill would work in a similar manner. 
   Our bill is basically a disclosure bill. It requires that whenever a vehicle's title is transferred, the seller must disclose in writing to the buyer any accident history of the vehicle which includes: salvage, flood, nonrepairable or major damage. Our bill defines ``salvage'', ``flood'', ``nonrepairable'' and ``major damage'' to provide broad disclosure and to protect consumer safety. These definitions are consistent with recommendations from the state Attorneys General. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion, the sale of rebuilt wrecks to unsuspecting buyers is a serous problem and should be stopped as soon as possible. The Feinstein, Levin, Bryan bill will do just that by establishing uniform disclosure standards for all vehicle sales and requiring all states to carry forward this disclosure on the vehicle's title. Simply put, our bill will put an end to title-washing.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my good friend from Virginia is very wise and perceptive. Indeed, I do have a comment. He asked the question whether the Senate is more concerned about Russian reaction to national missile defense than about Russian reaction to NATO expansion. And, of course, there is a huge difference. In one case we have a treaty with Russia. It is called the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And before we pull out of that treaty, or unilaterally act in a way that is in violation of that treaty, we ought to consider the ramifications. 
   The point is we have a treaty with Russia that has made possible significant nuclear arms reduction. We had no such treaty with Russia relative to NATO; quite the opposite--our NATO treaty was against the former Soviet Union. Russia wasn't part of any NATO treaty. Its predecessor, the Soviet Union, was the problem against which that NATO treaty was created. So this is a day-and-night comparison. Surely, when you have a treaty with someone, before you unilaterally breach it or threaten to breach it, you should consider the consequences of that. We have such a treaty with Russia. The opposite was true with NATO. So the difference is a 180-degree difference.

   Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is exactly correct. And that is precisely what we are now doing relative to our treaty with Russia, with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. We are sitting down with Russia now and seeing whether we can't negotiate a modification in that treaty which would permit two things to happen: 1, the deployment of a national missile defense should we decide to deploy it; and, 2, continuing nuclear arms reductions which have been provided for--in effect, permitted -- under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. So that is exactly what we are trying to do now. 
   But any comparison between the situation of having a treaty relationship with somebody and having a treaty which was aimed against that person, it seems to me, is an inapt comparison. I just wanted to briefly comment on it.

   Mr. LEVIN. I think those negotiations began just a few weeks ago. And I was urging the administration in the middle of last year to begin those discussions and those negotiations. So the actual preliminary discussions I think began in February. As far as I am concerned, it would have been better to begin those discussions before that, and I had urged the administration last 
     year to begin them. But as I understand it, there were informal discussions which had occurred before this recent visit that the Senator from Virginia, my good friend, has referred to.

   Mr. LEVIN. I would agree that the bill as it now stands, with an amendment which adopts as a policy of the United States to continue to negotiate arms reductions with Russia, is indeed going to be an incentive to those discussions because it no longer threatens to just unilaterally breach a treaty between ourselves and Russia. 
   On the first point, however, I would disagree with my dear friend from Virginia. I believe the discussions with the Russians on our National Missile Defense program did not begin until last year, and the informal discussions relative to modifications in the ABM Treaty did not occur until February. I believe, in fact, I wrote the administration--and I think I shared my letter with my friend from Virginia--I wrote the administration I believe in August urging that these discussions and negotiations take place. 
   Mr. President, in 1993 the administration, the Clinton administration, just as it came into office, terminated the defense and space talks which dealt precisely with modifications of the ABM Treaty. I think we can produce a record how this debate on the ABM Treaty has gone on for a very, very long time without any productive or concrete results.

   Mr. LEVIN. That is not the issue, though, that we have been discussing here this morning. The issue we have been discussing here this morning is whether or not we can work out with the Russians a modification of the ABM Treaty such as to permit us to deploy what is admittedly covered now by the treaty, namely a limited National Missile Defense system. 
   The discussions which have been referred to by my friend from Virginia had to do with the question of what is or is not covered by the treaty as it is currently written: What is the correct demarcation between those missile defenses which are covered by the treaty and those missile defenses which are not? And, indeed, he is correct; those demarcation discussions have been going on with the Russians, and indeed there was an agreement relative to the proper demarcation line. But the discussions relative to modifying the treaty so that we could deploy a limited national missile defense against what is admittedly covered by the treaty are discussions which have only begun in a preliminary manner in February of this year and informally began, I believe, last year.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is intriguing is, in fact, we did assert our position relative to the correct demarcation line, and indeed we put it in law, and indeed the demarcation line which was adopted by this administration and Russia followed what we had put into law. So we had asserted what our position was as the U.S. Senate and, if my memory is correct, as a Congress, because I believe the language ended up in the final authorization bill as to where that demarcation line should be. The agreement which was reached indeed--my understanding is and my recollection is--followed the demarcation line which the Congress had set forth in that authorization bill. 
   So it is nothing new for Congress to assert its involvement in these kinds of issues. We should. We have. We should be partners with the administration on this issue. I believe this bill as amended--I know it is now acceptable to the President with these amendments--represents the effort to come up with a more bipartisan approach to these critical national security issues.

   Mr. LEVIN. To my good friend from New Mexico, I say there is no prohibition in this bill against them using the regular procedures. So it is my assumption they would use those procedures given the absence of any prohibition. 
   Secondly, the word ``effective'' that is in the bill, it seems to me, does include the critical operational effectiveness concept which the Senator has referred to. Indeed, the word ``effective'' could cover a number of elements of effectiveness, but surely one of them is, I believe--and the sponsor of the bill has just confirmed this, I believe--that ``operational effectiveness'' would be included in the concept of ``effectiveness.''

He has raised a very important issue which was the subject of major discussion at the Armed Services Committee the other day; that is, the importance that any weapon system, before it is deployed, be shown to be operationally effective. I think his sensitivity to that issue has been longstanding, and I want to thank him for clarifying the RECORD relative to this bill. 
   So that it is clear to Senator BINGAMAN and to all of the Members, the word ``effective'' in the bill includes the concept of operational effectiveness. There are other elements of effectiveness which could also be covered, but surely it includes the operational effectiveness concept which the Senator has championed for so long. 
   I thank the Senator.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly make a statement before asking the question, so he doesn't lose his right to the floor. 
   The Senator has put his finger on a very significant issue--and it is one that all of us should struggle with, and many of us have struggled with. His effort here is to focus the attention of this body on a range of threats that we face. And to attempt to see if we can't get a better handle on the likelihood of those threats actually emerging is a very important action on his part. The chart he has used demonstrates what the problem is. There are many threats which are much more likely than a ballistic missile attack against us for which we have no defense. Perhaps we should devote resources to those, and then what would be the relationship between the costs of defending against those more likely threats compared to the cost of defending against a missile attack of the kind that could come from North Korea, theoretically. 
   General Shelton phrased the issue this way. This was on January 5. He said: 
   there are two aspects of the National Missile Defense [issue] that we have to be concerned with. Number one is: is the technology that allows us to deploy one that is an effective system, and within the means of this country money-wise?  
   This is General Shelton, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs saying this.  
   Secondly is the threat and whether or not the threat, when measured against all the other threats that we face, justifies the expenditure of that type of money for that particular system at the time when the technology will allow us to field it?  
   Those are the factors that the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs wants to consider, and those are some of the issues which the good Senator from Iowa is addressing our attention to. 
   I asked General Shelton to give us what we call a ``threat spectrum'' and asked him to try to give us a continuum of threats in terms of the most likely and less likely. 
   The least likely is in the upper right-hand corner, strategic missile attack, 6,000 Russian warheads. The next least likely is the rogue missile. The next least likely, major theater wars, such as in Korea. The next least likely is information wars, attacks on our satellites, or our power systems, or similar assets. The next least likely, but now becoming more and more likely, are terrorist attacks in the United States, some of which for instance the Senator from Iowa is talking about, and then terror attacks abroad, regional conflicts, and so forth. 
   This is the issue which the Senator from Iowa is really focusing our attention on today. But his amendment goes significantly beyond this chart, which, by the way, was prepared by General Shelton. 
   The amendment of the Senator from Iowa would get us into a greater element of comparative risk in terms of trying to get a range of likelihood of the risks, not just whether one risk is more likely than another. But his amendment, the way it is drafted, would consider how much more or how much less likely is one threat than another. 
   That is very valuable information, and General Shelton is attempting to work on that issue now. But the amendment of the Senator from Iowa puts it in a very precise and useful form. 
   In addition, it would be very helpful for us to know what would the range of costs be to defend against the various threats, if we can do so. And all I can do is assure my good friend from Iowa that we on the Armed Services Committee will take a good look at his amendment. It has my very strong support, and as he mentioned, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said he would be open to such an amendment on the defense authorization bill. 
   I think that is a very appropriate place for the amendment to go, and I think he would find, hopefully, bipartisan support on the committee for this kind of a study, because it really addresses an issue which I think every Member of this body would like to see addressed. 
   I thank him for his effort and assure him of my support on the armed services bill. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I would support an expansion of what we are doing to include the kind of factual analyses for which his amendment would call. 
   I thank him for the amendment and just assure him, if he does not offer it here, there will be a major effort to get it or something very close to it on the authorization bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I support the passage of this bill with the two amendments we have adopted. We have made a number of very important changes in the bill which now cause me to support the bill because, very specifically, we now have two policies that are set forth in the bill, no longer just one. 
   The first amendment that we have adopted, which was an amendment saying that the funding for national missile defense is subject to the annual authorization and appropriation of funds for this system, makes it clear explicitly, specifically, that this bill does not authorize anything. This is not an authorization of anything. It is not an appropriation of funds. 
   Perhaps somebody could argue before that amendment was adopted that this bill did authorize or did commit us to appropriate funds. But after the adoption of that first amendment yesterday, it cannot be argued that this authorizes anything or appropriates funds for any system. 
   This bill now states two policies of the United States. That is very different from a bill which commits us to authorize funds or to appropriate funds for a particular system. 
   So the first amendment made an important difference. It is an amendment which the Senator from Mississippi offered with a number of cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. It seems to me it made it very clear that we are not committing to deploy a national missile defense system in this bill. We are stating now two policies in this bill. The first amendment I referred to makes it clear that the authorization to deploy a national missile defense system would come only if and when we act on funding to deploy such a system through the normal authorization and appropriation process. We are not doing that in this bill. 
   One of the things this bill says is, before a deployment decision is made, there must be an effective system. That word ``effective'' clearly means, in the view of the military--and I think reasonably--an operationally effective system. That is one of the clear meanings of the word ``effective'' in this bill. And there was a colloquy earlier today between the Senators from Mississippi and New Mexico relating to that issue. An effective national missile defense system means, among  other elements of ``effectiveness,'' an operationally effective system. 
   The second amendment that has made a major change and a major improvement in this bill is the Landrieu amendment. Until Senator LANDRIEU's amendment was adopted, this bill ignored the crucial importance to our national security of continuing reductions in Russian nuclear weapons. Without the Landrieu amendment, this bill would have put nuclear reductions at risk--reductions that have been negotiated before and are now 
   being implemented, reductions that have been negotiated before and are hopefully about to be ratified in the Duma. 
   Without the Landrieu amendment, this bill ignored those reductions. It would have put such reductions at risk and increased the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That greater threat would have resulted from the larger number of nuclear weapons being on Russian soil, with the greater likelihood, in turn, that there would be leakage of such weapons to a terrorist state or a terrorist group. 
   The Landrieu amendment adds a second policy to this bill. It is a most crucial policy statement, that it is our policy to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. This critically important change in the bill states that we understand the value of continuing the nuclear arms reductions which have been negotiated before and that, hopefully, will continue to be negotiated in START III, and that those reductions improve our security by reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons on Russian soil. 
   Mr. President, without those two amendments, I would not have supported this bill. As I stated in my opening statement, it is critically important, in my opinion, that we continue to see reductions in nuclear weapons in this world, and most specifically, reductions in nuclear weapons in Russia. 
   I think many of our colleagues, if not all of us, see the importance of those reductions. Now we have a specific policy statement equal to the policy statement relative to deploying an effective limited national missile defense subject to authorization and appropriations. The second policy statement which is critically important says that it is the policy of the United States to continue to negotiate reductions in the number of nuclear weapons on Russian soil. 
   Because of these amendments, the President's senior national security advisers will now recommend that the President not veto the bill if it comes to him in this form. That is an important measure of the significance of these changes in this bill. The White House has not changed its position on national missile defense anymore than I have. 
   The bill has been changed in two significant ways. I think the bill has been vastly improved. It has been improved because of the efforts of many people. I want to thank the Senator from Mississippi, the author of this bill, for his cooperation in including both the Cochran amendment and the Landrieu amendment. And I particularly want to commend and thank the Senator from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, who is now the ranking member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, for her hard work and her dedication in bringing about the adoption of an amendment which made such an important difference in this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring someone who has already done more to serve his country than most people could accomplish in several lifetimes, BOB KERREY. 
   Many of my colleagues today have described the circumstances thirty years ago when a twenty-five year old Lieutenant KERREY led an elite Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team to successfully apprehend a group of North Vietnamese soldiers. I stand in awe as they have recounted the way in which Lt. KERREY continued to direct the team despite his serious injury. For his extraordinary valor, Lt. KERREY was rightfully bestowed the nation's highest award for military service, the Medal of Honor in 1970, by President Richard Nixon. 
   These actions alone are worthy of reflection by this body thirty years after the event. However, this was only one episode in a lifetime of extraordinary service to his country by Senator BOB KERREY. Luckily for our nation, he did not allow the unfortunate events of that day thirty years ago to stop him from reaching the lofty goals that he had always set for himself. After a trying rehabilitation in Philadelphia, KERREY returned to Nebraska and began his life anew, becoming a successful businessman and eventually winning a race for the state's Governorship. In 1988, he won election to the Senate after mounting a spirited campaign. 
   During his time in the Senate, BOB KERREY has continued to exhibit exemplary bravery and dedication. He has taken on some of the most important and difficult issues this body faces: Social Security reform, IRS reform and repeated farm crises. Senator KERREY focused on the issue of Social Security early in his career, and his many efforts have greatly enhanced the prospects for reform of this important and far reaching program. Senator KERREY is a champion of American agriculture, working tirelessly to support and protect family farmers facing economic hardship. He has also dedicated himself to improving health care services in the United States. 
   Mr. President, we honor Senator BOB KERREY today because thirty years ago he exhibited extraordinary heroism under the most difficult of circumstances. Senator KERREY's duty and sacrifice on that day and his important contributions since continue to earn him the respect of the people of Nebraska and the United States. I am delighted to join my Senate colleagues in honoring Senator BOB KERREY.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will propound a unanimous consent agreement hopefully after the Senator from Colorado has completed his presentation. I will need about 10 minutes in support of the Landrieu-Levin amendment, which is a critically important amendment. It should be discussed before we vote on it because of the impact it will have, I believe, on the bill and perhaps on the vote on the bill, because it will also have an impact on the recommendation of the senior advisers to the President as to whether or not he will veto this bill. 
   Because it is so significant--it is simple but very vital and very significant--it is important that there be discussion of the Landrieu amendment. So I will need about 10 minutes on that, I alert my friend from Mississippi. We can figure out if any time agreement is possible after the Senator from Colorado has completed.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment of Senator LANDRIEU that is pending is a very simple and a very straightforward amendment, but it is a vital amendment. It will make a major difference in this bill, because if this amendment is adopted, this bill will contain two policy statements. It now contains but one. The policy statement that it currently contains has to do with the deployment of a missile defense system. The policy statement, which the Landrieu amendment will add, is that it is the policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. 
   This is a very significant policy statement, and I want to take just a minute and explain why. 
   In my opening comments on this bill, I addressed what I consider to be a number of flaws or omissions in this bill. I talked about the fact that there is no reference here to ``operational effectiveness.'' One can look at the word  ``effective'' in this bill's language and argue, I think reasonably, that operational effectiveness is included in that term ``effectiveness.'' Nonetheless, I think the bill would be stronger if that were clearer. That was one of the issues which was raised. 
   It is a very important question to our uniformed military and to the Secretary of Defense, because they want to be sure that before any decision is made to deploy, that we have an operationally effective system, that it works. And those are not just casual words. ``Operational effectiveness'' are words that have a very important technical meaning to our military. 
   I also pointed out in my opening remarks that there was no reference in here to cost. Now there is. 
   With the Cochran amendment that was adopted earlier this afternoon, we now at least have an acknowledgment that the usual authorization and appropriation process is going to apply to national missile defense. The authorizers and the appropriators naturally look at cost. So there is now, at least in this bill with the adoption of the Cochran amendment, a way in which the cost issue will be addressed in the years to come. 
   Another factor which the uniformed military and our civilian leadership wanted to look at is the threat. I think it is clear to most of us that there is a threat that was not predicted to come this quickly but which is either here or will soon be here from states such as North Korea. 
   Finally--and this was the one which to me was the greatest sticking point--is the omission in this bill, until Senator LANDRIEU's amendment was introduced and hopefully will be adopted, of the acknowledgment of the importance of continuing to negotiate reductions in Russian nuclear forces. Those reductions are critically important to our security. Those reductions have been carried out, and hopefully additional reductions will be carried out, because we have a treaty with Russia which has allowed for these reductions to be carried out in a way which is strategically stable. 
   That treaty, called the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, has been critically important to nuclear arms reductions. Hopefully, there will be further reductions negotiated. Hopefully, the Duma will ratify START II. But it is important that we be aware of the fact that arms reductions, nuclear arms reductions, are very important in terms of reducing proliferation threats and very important in terms of the terrorist threat. 
   If we act in such a way that leads Russia to stop the reduction of the nuclear weapons on her soil, to stop the dismantling of the nuclear weapons on her soil, to stop negotiating further reductions in nuclear weapons, we are taking a very dangerous step in terms of our own security. 
   That is why the fourth point which our uniformed military has pointed to as being important, in terms of considering national missile defense deployment, is the effect of that deployment on nuclear arms reductions. Nobody is going to give Russia or any other country a veto over whether or not we deploy a national missile defense system. That issue has got to be resolved in terms of our own security. If it adds to our security, we should do it. If it diminishes our security, we should not. 
   But whether or not it adds to our security is dependent upon a number of factors. And one of those factors is the effect on the nuclear weapons reduction program on Russian soil. This has been pointed out at the highest level between President Clinton and President Yeltsin. In their Helsinki summit statement in March of 1997, they emphasized--and these are their words-- ``the importance of further reductions in strategic offensive arms'' and they recognized explicitly, in their words, ``the significance of the ABM Treaty for those objectives.'' 
   Secretary Cohen, has recognized and stated the importance of that treaty between ourselves and Russia in terms of accomplishing these nuclear arms reduction objectives. 
   Sandy Berger, in a letter which he has addressed to us, has recognized and stated the importance of that treaty between ourselves and Russia in terms of reducing nuclear arms and the threat of proliferation to this country. 
   In his letter he said:  
   The Administration strongly opposes S. 257 because it suggests that our decision on deploying this system should be based solely on a determination that the system is ``technologically possible.'' This unacceptably narrow definition would ignore other critical factors that the Administration believes must be addressed when it considers the deployment question in 2000.......  
   And then he went on to say:  
   A decision regarding national missile defense deployment must also be addressed within the context of the ABM Treaty and our objectives for achieving future reductions in strategic offensive arms through START II and [START] III. The ABM Treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic stability, and Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agree that it is of fundamental significance to achieving the elimination of thousands of strategic nuclear arms under these treaties.  
   What this amendment before us does is simply acknowledge the policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. That is all that it says. In that sense it is very straightforward, very direct. But it also, to me at least, and I think to many other Members of this body, acknowledges that we have a number of policy goals that we should be achieving. 
   One is the deployment of an effective national missile defense system to meet a threat--I believe that is a legitimate policy goal that Senator COCHRAN's bill sets forth--a policy to deploy a cost-effective, operationally effective national missile defense to meet a threat. We do not have that system yet. It is being developed as quickly as we possibly can. 
   Hopefully, someday we will have a cost-effective, operationally effective national missile defense system. And hopefully, we can take that step after negotiating modifications with the Russians to that treaty, so that we can proceed consistent with a cooperative relationship with the Russians and not in a confrontational way. If we cannot do it cooperatively and with an amendment to that treaty, and if our security interests indicate that we should do it because we have something operationally effective and cost effective, and the threat is there, then we should do it anyway. 
   But what the Landrieu language does is state a very important policy objective that I hope all of us share: to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. It is that straightforward. It is that important. I commend the Senator from Louisiana for framing an amendment in a way which hopefully will attract broad bipartisan support but at the same time makes a very important addition to this bill by setting forth, if this is adopted, two important policies of this Government.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I share the goal of providing the American people with effective protection against the emerging long-range missile threat from rogue states. 
   I support developing an operationally effective, cost-effective limited national missile defense, and making an effort to negotiate with Russia, for a reasonable period of time, any appropriate modifications to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that might be necessary to permit deployment of a limited national missile defense system. That is why, Madam President, I support the Defense Department's National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program to develop a limited NMD system to protect the United States against such a developing threat. 
   But that is not what this bill before us does. 
   This bill says we are going to deploy a national missile defense system ``as soon as technologically possible.'' No other factors are to be considered. Don't consider if the system is operationally effective. 
   Those are important words to the military, ``operationally effective.'' But we are not supposed to consider that under this bill. 
   Don't consider if it is cost-effective. Don't consider whether it ends the elimination of thousands of nuclear weapons in Russia under the START process. Don't consider whether it increases the threat of the proliferation of these terrible weapons to rogue states interested in getting them by any means possible. This bill says to heck with all of these considerations--we are going to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it is technologically possible, no matter whether it is operationally effective, no matter if it increases the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons, no matter what it costs. 
   The fundamental question that we should ask ourselves is whether passing this bill will make us more secure or less secure. 
   That is truly the fundamental question that all of us must address. 
   I agree with the President's senior national security advisors that enacting this bill will make us less secure. It puts at risk our decades-long efforts to reduce strategic offensive nuclear weapons in Russia and increases the likelihood that these weapons will proliferate to rogue states.

   Mr. LEVIN. I will just read a few other portions of Mr. Berger's letter, where he explains the basis for the position of the President's senior national security advisors recommending that this bill be vetoed if it is passed:  
   The Administration strongly opposes S. 257 because it suggests that our decision on deployment of this system should be based solely on a determination that the system is  ``technologically possible.'' This unacceptably narrow definition would ignore other critical factors that the Administration believes must be addressed when it considers the deployment question in 2000, including those that must be evaluated by the President as Commander-in-Chief. 
   We intend to base the deployment decision on an assessment of the technology (based on an initial series of rigorous flight-tests) and the proposed system's operational effectiveness. In addition, the President and his senior advisors will need to confirm whether the rogue state ballistic missile threat to the United States has developed as quickly as we now expect, as well as the cost to deploy.  
   Then Mr. Berger went on to say the following:  
   A decision regarding NMD deployment must also be addressed within the context of the ABM Treaty and our objectives for achieving future reductions in strategic offensive arms through START II and III. The ABM Treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic stability and Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agree that it is of fundamental significance to achieving the elimination of thousands of strategic nuclear arms under these treaties.  
   Madam President, senior Defense Department officials have stated repeatedly that the Department of Defense is already developing a national missile defense system as fast as is technically possible. Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre testified to the Armed Services Committee on October 2, 1998, that the national missile defense program:  
   ......is as close as we can get in the Department of Defense to a Manhattan project. We are pushing this very fast.  
   And General Joe Ralston, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified at the same hearing:  
   I know of no other program in the Department of Defense that has had as many constraints removed in terms of oversight and reviews just so that we can develop and deploy it as quickly as possible.  
   As the Department of Defense has made clear on numerous occasions, adding more money will not accelerate the program because we are moving this program, the development program, as quickly as is possible, and there are no resource constraints on that development. In addition, on January 20, Defense Secretary Cohen announced four steps, demonstrating the commitment to develop an operationally effective national missile defense as quickly as possible, achieving the option to deploy, not only as quickly as possible, but also in a way consistent with continuing nuclear arms reductions. 
   First, Secretary Cohen announced the Defense Department would be budgeting the funds--and they now have $6.6 billion--in the Future Years Defense Program for possible deployment of a limited national missile defense system. This funding will permit deployment if the decision is made to deploy. This would bring the total national missile defense funding for 1999 through 2005 to $10.5 billion. 
   Second, Secretary Cohen affirmed that the administration expects that the threat of ballistic missiles from rogue nations will continue to grow and will pose a threat to the U.S. territory in the near future. 
   Third, Secretary Cohen announced that the administration is seeking possible changes to the ABM Treaty with Russia in the event that deployment would require modification. 
   I was particularly glad to hear that because I had been urging the administration to take this step myself for many, many months. Secretary Cohen also noted that if we cannot agree on changes to the treaty, the United States can exercise its right to withdraw from the treaty under the ``supreme national interest'' clause of the treaty, if necessary for our national security. 
   Finally, Secretary Cohen announced that the earliest anticipated deployment date for the national missile defense system was going to be 2005 instead of 2003, because of concerns about the technology of the system and because certain critical tests will not occur until 2003. 
   Secretary Cohen's announcement clearly demonstrates the administration's commitment to moving forward as quickly as possible with the development of an operationally effective national missile defense program. The Department of Defense policy, unlike the bill before us, permits consideration of a number of relevant factors, including operational effectiveness and cost, and permits us to pursue planned negotiations on possible ABM Treaty modifications before making a deployment decision next year, in the year 2000. 
   The national missile defense program is a high-risk program. It faces numerous technical challenges. The integration of all the component parts into a system that can demonstrate its capability is still years away. The first integrated system test using a production interceptor is not scheduled to take place until the year 2003. Prior to that time, tests will rely on surrogate components for some of the most critical pieces of hardware. But S. 257 will make the deployment commitment now, prior to any demonstration of the capability of the system, prior to any ability to evaluate whether it is operationally effective--key word ``operationally''--and able to meet its system requirements. As the Defense Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff have pointed out, if we were to commit to deployment of an NMD system ``as soon as technologically possible,'' we might be committing ourselves to building a system that is not as effective as we would need or desire to counter the evolving threat. 
   In 1997, General John Shalikashvili, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified to the committee that the earliest possible system may not provide the necessary capability:  
   If a decision is made to deploy an NMD system in the near term, then the system fielded would provide a very limited capability. If deploying a system in the near term can be avoided, DOD can continue to enhance the technology base and the commensurate capability of the NMD program system.  
   That is why General Shalikashvili stated at the same time that the National Missile Defense Readiness Program of the administration is the program that ``optimizes the potential for an effective national missile defense system.'' 
   The normal Department of Defense acquisition process for major weapons systems requires a rigorous review of numerous technical performance and cost considerations at each major decision point in the development or acquisition process. The Department of Defense has mandatory procedures for major defense acquisition programs that provide that ``threat projections, system performance, unit production cost estimates, life cycle costs, cost performance tradeoffs, acquisition strategy, affordability constraints and risk management shall be major considerations at each milestone decision point.''

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just a couple of additional brief points. First, there is one thing we do agree on, I hope unanimously, in this body, which is that our highest priority is to defend the security interests of the United States. I do not know of anybody in this body who would disagree with that premise. The question is, Is our security advanced or is it harmed by making a statement that we are going to deploy a system that violates a treaty with Russia, without first trying to at least negotiate a modification in that treaty so that we can do so jointly without a unilateral breach? 
   The stakes here are huge. We should make no mistake about it. The stakes are that Russia has been reducing the number of nuclear weapons on its soil. Indeed, we have been helping to dismantle those weapons so that we are safer. And what they have told us is that the reason they have done that is because they have a treaty with us which has permitted them to do that called the ABM Treaty, and that without that treaty in place--indeed, without that treaty enhanced--those reductions are going to end. 
   We want fewer nuclear weapons on Russian soil. The fewer weapons they have on their soil, the more secure we are. We have a treaty which has permitted a significant reduction of those weapons on Russian soil, and other states in the former Soviet Union. The fewer weapons they have, the less the chance of proliferation. 
   I think most of us would agree that the greatest threat that we face--security threat that we face--is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And the leakage of even one of those weapons from Russian soil to a rogue state or a terrorist organization would create a greater threat to the security of this Nation than any Soviet threat we face, because a rogue nation could use it against us, where the Soviets would have been committing suicide and would have cared about committing suicide if they started an attack. 
   The proliferation threat against us is real. We keep talking about it in this body. We keep saying the greatest emerging threat is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Before we take any step which would lead Russia to stop reducing the number of nuclear weapons on its soil, surely we ought to sit down and negotiate with Russia to see if we cannot do two things: One, accomplish a national missile defense here, assuming we can come up with one which is operationally effective; and, two, keep those reductions of nuclear weapons flowing. Those goals are not incompatible. We are seeking both of them right now. We are negotiating with the Russians in terms of a modification of the ABM Treaty, and we are developing national missile defense as quickly as is possible to develop. 
   There is no wait-and-see approach that has been going on here. The uniformed military have told us this is a high-risk development program. We are trying to do in a few years what usually takes us over 10 to develop. So we are engaged as quickly as we can in what Deputy Secretary Hamre called the closest thing to a Manhattan project as exists in the Defense Department. We are trying to develop a national missile defense. 
   I think most if not all Members of this body are in favor of that development. 
   The issue here in this bill is whether we commit to deploy that system before it is developed, before it is shown to be operationally effective, with no consideration to cost and without considering the need to try, if possible, to negotiate a modification in a treaty with the Russians which has allowed us and them to significantly reduce the number of nuclear weapons on their soil. 
   We can accomplish all those things, hopefully, but not if we perceive to tell the Russians, in advance of these negotiations being completed or at least proceeding, that we are pulling out of this treaty in order to deploy a system. There is not the slightest awareness in this resolution of the desirability of modifying the ABM Treaty with Russia so that we can continue to see reductions in nuclear weapons on their soil. 
   For heaven's sake, aren't we more secure if they have fewer nuclear weapons on their soil and if the ones that are being reduced are dismantled, ``defanged,'' so they no longer threaten us? Shouldn't we ask ourselves, Why is it the senior military leadership of this country does not support this bill, people who spend their lives and have dedicated their lives to the security of this Nation--our top military officials--do not support this bill. Shouldn't we ask ourselves why? 
   There is no use invoking the question of Scud missiles. The defense against Scud missiles does not violate a treaty between us and Russia. The Patriot antimissile system, which we continue to support I think unanimously in this body and continue to seek to improve it, is a defense against theater ballistic missiles, the missiles such as the Scud missile. There is no issue about that. I think everybody in this body has for decades supported a theater missile defense system. That is not a violation of the ABM Treaty. A limited national missile defense system probably will violate that treaty.  
   Before we commit to do as this bill does, we should seek to modify a treaty between us and Russia so that we can do two things at once: Deploy a system, assuming we can get one that is operationally effective against the rogue states, at the same time that we continue to obtain and achieve the reduction of nuclear missiles on Russian soil. Those goals are compatible, they are both desirable, they are both achievable. At least we hope they are both achievable. Surely we ought to explore whether they are both achievable without committing ourselves to a course of action which tells the Russians, on the eve of the visit of Prime Minister Primakov we are going to do something, like it or not, whether it violates a treaty between us or not. I must again ask this question: If the Russian Duma had taken an action 1 week before our President went to Moscow, which tore at the basic fundamental security relationship between us and Russia, what would our reaction be in this Senate? 
   What troubles me the most is it is so needless. We are not advancing by 1 day the development of a national missile defense system in this bill; not by a day. I think everybody in this body wants to develop a national missile defense system as quickly as can be done. The money is in the budget to do so and has been there. The Congress has added some hundreds of millions dollars, by the way, over the years for broad support in order to make sure we do develop a national missile defense as quickly as we possibly can. The President's budget has the money in there to deploy such a system--assuming we can 
   develop it. We are not advancing by 1 day the development of a national missile defense with this bill. 
   What we are doing is jeopardizing the reductions of nuclear weapons on Russian soil for no gain in terms of the development of national missile defense. That commitment to deploy, which this bill represents, gains us nothing in terms of developing more speedily the system which we all want to be developed, but jeopardizes the reduction of nuclear weapons on Russian soil which is so important to the security of this Nation. 
   My good friend from Mississippi surely speaks for all of us when he says that is our top priority as a Senate. I couldn't agree with the Senator more. There are very strong differences, however, as to whether or not that priority is achieved with this bill, which ignores one-half of a very important issue, which is the relationship between the deployment of a national missile defense and the reduction of nuclear weapons on Russian soil and the proliferation problem that is increased when we act in a way that reduces the prospects of those continuing reductions. 
   I yield the floor.

   Yvonne Gellise was born in Bay City, Michigan, the fifth and last child of Levy and Regina Gellise. An early experience with polio fostered her early determination that characterized her many efforts on behalf the community. In 1995, Yvonne joined the Religious Sisters of Mercy and became Sister Yvonne Gellise. Since then, Sister Yvonne has served in several administrative positions in Mercy facilities in Michigan and Iowa. A milestone in her career came when she was named chief executive officer of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor. Sister Yvonne provided indispensable leadership during the relocation of the hospital to its current site. Sister Yvonne currently serves as senior advisor for Governance at Saint Joseph Mercy Health System, Ann Arbor. 
   Mr. President, Sister Yvonne Gellise is a very deserving recipient of the Mary Maurita Sengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious Service. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring her on the notable contribution she made to our community.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Dr. Steven Bolton, who was recently awarded the Mary Maurita Sengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious Service for 1998. This award is presented annually to a person ``whose contributions to the healing ministry are in striking harmony with the works of Catherine McAuley, foundress and first Sister of Mercy.'' 
   Steve Bolton was raised in the city of Detroit. While growing up in the city his parents placed a strong emphasis on helping the less fortunate in our society, and he has passed that feeling along to his three sons. This experience led Steve Bolton, following in the footsteps of his older siblings, to dedicate himself to becoming a doctor in order to ``understand what makes us human and to use this knowledge to help others.'' Steve eventually came to understand how poverty affects the health of the ``working poor'' and is now a general surgeon at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland making a difference in the lives of working families. 
   Steve Bolton has also served over the past seven years as volunteer medical director of Mercy Place in Pontiac, Michigan. Mercy Place is a clinic offering free health care to the community. In addition to his demanding work schedule as a general surgeon, Steve volunteers several days a week at the clinic. He also often donates his professional fees if a patient needs surgery and cannot afford to pay. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Steve Bolton is most deserving of the Mary Maurita  Sengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious Service. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this extraordinary individual for the outstanding work he does on behalf of the community.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 and announce my opposition to the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. 
   Palestinian statehood is an issue that has been left to be resolved between Israel and the Palestinians during permanent status negotiations. Nevertheless, Chairman Yasser Arafat has stated on a number of occasions his intention to declare a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999. This action would seriously undermine the continuation of the Oslo peace process. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has stated publicly that he would respond to such a unilateral declaration by annexing parts of the West Bank. Such a chain of events would surely mark a major setback and probably the end of the peace process. 
   In his September 9, 1993 letter to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Chairman Arafat writes that ``all outstanding issues will be resolved through negotiations.'' The unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would clearly violate this commitment as well as the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which was signed in Washington, D.C. on September 28, 1995. The agreement states that it is the understanding of the parties involved that permanent status negotiations ``shall cover remaining issues, including: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, borders, relations and cooperation with other neighbors, and other issues of common interest'' and further that ``neither  side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations.'' 
   Mr. President, this resolution puts the U.S. Senate on record as opposing the unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood. It is a statement, in my mind, in support of the peace process and the continuation of negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Negotiation and mutual agreement are the only way a true and lasting peace can be reached in the Middle East. While a Palestinian state may indeed become a reality at some point in the future, it is my hope that any such entity would be born from the direct negotiations of the Israeli and Palestinian people and not a unilateral declaration.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues Senator MURRAY, Senator KENNEDY and others in introducing this Class Size Reduction amendment, which builds on last years successful effort towards reducing class sizes in grades 1-3 to 18 or fewer students nationwide. Last year, President Clinton proposed this historic initiative and Congress approved a down payment on this request last year, providing a $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire approximately 30,000 teachers nationwide. 
   Under the initiative enacted into law last year, school districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin reducing class size this fall. While last year's appropriation provided an important start on this seven year initiative, the amendment before us gives us a chance to support effective local planning by giving school districts the confidence they need that funding will be available under this initiative for future years. 
   The average U.S. class size is 24 students with some as high as 30 students per class. A consensus of research indicates that students attending small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational progress than students in larger classes and that those achievement gains persist through at least the middle grades. More specifically, class size reduction leads to enhanced teacher-student quality relationships, higher student achievement, solid foundation for further student learning, and the ability of students to read independently by the end of the 3rd grade. 
   Mr. President, there are 3,750 schools in my state of Michigan. Some of these schools have been fortunate enough to reduce some of their classes in the early grades. Last month, I visited about a dozen of them, witnessing first  hand the benefits of smaller classes. I also visited several of the numerous schools in my state that are disadvantaged by large class sizes. For example, at the Calvin Britain Elementary School in Benton Harbor, where the student to teacher ratio is higher than the national average, teachers worry that they are not able to identify their students' learning needs. When I asked 2nd grade teacher Louise Hufnagel what it would mean to reduce her class of 26 down to 17 or 18, she said, ``It would make a world of difference. A lot of the children have special needs and it would make it easier to give them the individual attention they need.'' 
   At East Leonard Elementary School in Grand Rapids, principal Tina Barwacz said she is convinced that lower class size improves academic performance. Teachers there are now giving more personalized attention to their students because their classes are smaller. Third grade teacher Dan Mayhew, with 17 students this year down from 23 last year, says that now he can get to each student more often and make sure the individual masters the standards and the core curriculum. Another third grade teacher, Sharon Uminski, with 17 students this year, down from 28 last year, says she gets to know her class better, including learning faster students strengths and weaknesses. She went on to say that it also allows her to initiate remedial education in a subject when necessary on an individual basis; and that she encounters less discipline problems resulting in more class time for instruction. First Grade teacher Teresa Guinnup who had 25 students last year and 17 this year says now she can talk to each child and check his or her ability. The students told me that they like smaller class sizes because it was easier to concentrate, there was more room and some kids get to sit at their own desk. 
   At Winchell Elementary School in Kalamazoo where some classes have gone from 29 down to 17, teachers are seeing major improvements in their pupil's reading skills. First grade teacher, Mary Trotter, who had 28 students last year and has 19 this year said, ``I'm able to give children much more individual help. It's a dream.'' First grade teacher Kitty Wunderlin who had 29 students last year and 19 this year, said ``it is divine to have 19 students. I can give them one to one attention. With 29 students I felt overwhelmed.'' And, first grade teacher Kathie Gibson told me, ``I've seen great gains in my students reading skills this year.'' 
   In Lansing, at Harley Frank Elementary School, kindergarten teacher Mrs. Zimmerman, who has been teaching for 34 years and who last year planned to retire until she heard class sizes were going to be reduced, said that she now has more control over her class, the kids are happier and more adjusted and in short, they are able to learn more. With smaller classes, teachers can assess each student's progress in a more timely manner and students develop more interest in learning, all of which create higher student achievement. 
   Many other direct experiences of teachers and students were shared with me. For instance, at Merrill Community Elementary school in Flint, which started a class downsizing program five years ago for grades K-4. Before this program began, their student to teacher ratio was 30-1. One teacher, Mrs. Stephanie Thibault told me that ``having 30 first and second graders in a classroom was overwhelming and exhausting.'' Teachers would literally find themselves counselling some of their students in the hallways because their buildings and classrooms were so overcrowded. After the implementation of their new program, that ratio changed to 17 students to 1 teacher, and listen to the difference expressed by Mrs. Thibault. She exclaims ``As a teacher, my role has expanded beyond instruction. Having a 17-1 ratio allows me to know my students and their families better, allows me to personalize learning tasks for each child and it gives me opportunities to provide one-on-one help. Students benefit because they receive the attention and caring they deserve.'' 
   Because of a class size reduction program, Mrs. Thibault can now give students the instruction they deserve. Isn't that exactly what we should strive for? Our teachers should not be overwhelmed and exhausted at the end of each day. Our students should not be competing with each other to get the attention of their teachers. Each child deserves that attention and caring that teachers like Mrs. Thibault can provide. But some teachers are not capable of providing that teaching environment. Too many of our classrooms are spilling out into the hallways and until we change this by reducing class size, our young people will be at a disadvantage. 
   When we reduce class size, we not only help our teachers and students, but we meet needs of parents whose children are learning more and performing better in school. When the program to reduce class size first began in the Flint Community School District, test scores for students were low. For the 1994-95 school year, only 8 percent of the students at Merrill Elementary passed the ``Reading/Story'' portion of the Michigan Education Assessment Program, the MEAP test. For that same year, only 26 percent passed the ``Reading/Info'' section and just 10 percent passed the Math portion of the MEAP test. Since the implementation of the program, the students at Merrill Elementary school have seen their scores rise dramatically, and I'm not just taking about a couple of percentage points. Last school year, after just 4 years of smaller class sizes, 54 percent of those elementary students passed the ``Reading/Story'' portion of the test, an increase of 45 percent. In addition, 70 percent of Merrill elementary students passed the ``Reading/Info'' portion, a 44 percent increase and 55 percent passed the ``Math'' section of the MEAP test, a 44 percent increase. In just a few years, these students were receiving more attention in a better academic environment and were simply, learning more. 
   Let's take the important lessons from these elementary schools in Michigan and apply them to this legislation. We must start reducing class sizes now. If we fail to pass this amendment, reducing class size, we fail the students of Michigan and the rest of the nation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation to provide quality after school programs for our nation's youth. There are 23.5 million school-age children who have working parents, and of these children, 5 to 7 million are considered ``latchkey'' kids, or children who are alone at some point in the day. 
   Mr. President, law enforcement statistics show that from the hours of 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., students between the ages 12 to 17, are more likely to commit violent acts or be the victims of violent activity. We know that they are more likely to engage in these activities if young people are without adult supervision. According to a report published by the U.S. Departments of Education and U.S. Department of Justice in June of 1998, entitled Safe and Smart: Making After School Hours Work for Kids, ``first and foremost, after school programs keep children of all ages safe and out of trouble.'' 
   There is no question that after-school programs keep most kids out of trouble, unfortunately, there are not enough of them to keep all kids on the right track. According to findings of Mr. Herbert Moyer of the Michigan State Board of Education, which were published in the March 10, 1999 Oakland Press:  
   More than 80 percent of parents want their children to attend an after-school program, but only 30 percent of elementary and middle schools offer such programs. After-school hours are when juvenile crime rates triple and youth without positive alternatives may do drugs, smoke, drink or engage in sexual activity ..... eighth-graders who are left unsupervised for 11 hours or more a week are twice as likely to abuse drugs or alcohol as those under adult supervision.  
   Mr. President, this amendment would make a substantial effort to resolve that problem. By increasing the appropriations for the 21st Century Learning Centers program to $600 million, a three fold increase over last year's funding, public schools will be able to develop after school centers for children that provide educational, recreational, cultural, health and social services. Specifically, activities and services may include: Literacy programs, telecommunications and technology education programs, mentoring, academic assistance, job skills assistance, expanded library services, nutrition and health programs, summer and weekend school programs, services to individuals with disabilities, drug, alcohol, and gang prevention. 
   Last year, 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants were awarded to four school districts in my State. Schools in Armada, Benton Harbor, Grant Rapids and the Highland Park School have received these grants. I would like to share with you some of the possibilities that these grants can provide to local school districts around my state and nationwide. 
   In the Armada Area Schools, the district planned a virtual network of middle school computer centers (called ``clubhouse''). The centers are meant to increase student engagement in learning through computer use; foster collaboration among students, schools and communities; and develop a model of statewide collaboration through the sharing of resources. 
   The Benton Harbor Area Schools planned to partner up with local community groups and Western Michigan University to provide Community Learning Centers, which are established to assist middle school students in developing literacy and technology skills and they plan, produce, and present constructive projects that deal with community-wide issues such as poverty, violence, drug use, and teen pregnancy. 
   The Grand Rapids Public Schools planned to create four local Learning Centers in its middle schools. The program is designed to operate on afternoons, one evening per week, and several hours on Saturdays and provide enrichment activities, recreational activities, parent and child activities and community support activities. 
   The Highland Park School District, which collaborated with government, nonprofit groups, and local universities, planned to create two Learning Centers in their area. At these centers, students and community members can participate in academic programs, sports and recreational activities, literacy and family recreational activities. 
   I would like to applaud the innovative ways in which Michigan educators have provided students with after school programs. These school districts were selected for the 21st Century Learning Centers grants because of their innovative projects in addressing their after-school needs. And, let me say, Mr. President, that Michigan students and parents are lucky to have people like Kathleen Strauss, Vice President of the Michigan Board of  Education, who has championed the cause of after-school programs for our youth for many years. We are also lucky to have such dedicated educators, especially in Armada, Benton Harbor, Grand Rapids and Highland Park, who have helped students gain access to computers and new technologies, and to encourage student involvement in the community. 
   I am pleased that Michigan schools are benefiting from these grants, and am hopeful that the model set by these school districts will encourage the establishment of similar initiatives in communities throughout my state and the nation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Friday, an amendment was offered to the Ed-Flex bill to block implementation of certain regulations which the banking regulators had proposed for financial institutions to establish Know-Your-Customer programs. That amendment is still pending before the Senate. On Friday, my colleague from the Banking Committee, Senator SARBANES, made a number of thoughtful comments about the pending amendment. Today, I would like I to express some concerns about it as well. 
   First, like Senator SARBANES, I am struck by the irony of dealing with an amendment that addresses banking issues wholly unrelated to education, at the same time Democrats are being denied an opportunity to offer amendments on educational issues much more relevant to the Ed-Flex bill before us. 
   Be that as it may, this banking issue has been put before us. And like all of  my colleagues, I voted on Friday against tabling the pending amendment. I voted against tabling, because I think the amendment properly criticizes the proposed regulations for failing to protect ordinary law-abiding citizens from possibly unreasonable and invasive scrutiny by their financial institutions. 
   At the same time, my vote against tabling was not a general endorsement of the amendment. To the contrary, like the proposed regulations it criticizes, the amendment is not drafted as carefully as it should be. 
   The first part of the amendment prohibits the banking agencies from publishing ``in final form'' the flawed regulations proposed in December. I support that prohibition. But the second part of the amendment goes much farther. It also prohibits the banking agencies from proposing any regulation ``which is substantially similar to'' the proposals condemned in the first part. 
   The question is what ``substantially similar'' means. 
   If it means that the banking agencies should not propose know-your-customer regulations without including adequate privacy protections, that is fine. But if means that the agencies may not propose any know-your-customer regulations, no matter how finely tuned and protective of privacy, then the amendment is a serious mistake. If it means that agencies are not only prohibited from issuing regulations but should also start dismantling their existing know-your-customer practices, the amendment is a disaster. 
   I say that because know-your-customer programs are today a key part of law enforcement efforts to stop money laundering. Virtually all major financial institutions operating in the United States today have well developed know-your-customer programs, and U.S. bank examiners already routinely test the adequacy and effectiveness of these programs. For example, existing examination procedures testing bank compliance with the most important anti-money laundering statute on the books, the Bank Secrecy Act, already spell out the elements of an adequate know-your-customer program and test that program as part of its ``core analysis.'' 
   The purpose of these know-your-customer programs is to stop financial institutions from unwittingly helping criminals to launder illegal proceeds. 
   Ten or twenty years ago, if an individual walked into a U.S. bank with a million dollars stuffed into a duffel bag and asked the bank to wire the money to an offshore account in a foreign country, most banks would have done so with few or no questions asked. And the bank would have collected a nice fee for arranging the wire transfer. 
   But that was before the United States embarked upon a world-wide, intensive effort to educate banks and foreign governments about the benefits of battling crime by stopping money laundering. The goals are to make banks wary of moving funds for criminals, to seize illegal funds in the banking system, and to put money launderers in jail and out of business. 
   Congress has played a key role in the advancement of this law enforcement strategy. For example, the subcommittee on which I am the ranking minority member, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, held landmark hearings 15 years ago on how criminals were using financial institutions in the United States to launder their funds. The House and Senate Banking Committees have held numerous hearings over the years outlining the problem and proposing legislation to detect and stop money laundering. 
   In the last Congress, the House Banking Committee held a series of hearings and the Congress passed H.R. 1756, the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act. In this Congress, the leading crime bill proposed by the majority, S. 5, the Drug-Free Century Act, contains an entire title devoted to ``money laundering deterrence.'' Still another bill, H.R. 4005, the Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1998, which passed the House by voice vote last year but was not brought before the Senate actually directed the banking agencies to propose know-your-customer regulations within 120 days. 
   That's because virtually all money-laundering experts will tell you that know-your-customer programs are one of the most important tools financial institutions have to prevent money laundering. Two examples explain why as well as illustrate how a sensible idea can be pushed too far. 
   First, suppose a stranger walks into a bank with a million dollars in small bills and asks the bank to wire the cash to a foreign bank account. Should the bank wire the money and then, after the customer is gone, report the transaction to law enforcement, or should the bank first determine who the customer is and, if not satisfied, decline to transfer the money? To me, the answer is clear that the bank should determine who the customer is before moving any money. 
   Second example. Suppose a longtime customer of the bank with a modest savings account deposits $3,000 into that savings account. Should the bank report that $3,000 deposit to law enforcement? To me, the answer is obviously no. That type of report would unreasonably invade the customer's privacy, as well as be a waste of time for law enforcement. 
   Surely, we can design regulations that distinguish between these two examples. At a minimum, different rules should apply to customers holding assets or conducting transactions below a specified threshold. We already do that with currency transaction reports, and the same could and should be done with know-your-customer programs. Additional privacy protections should be provided to prohibit banks from using know-your-customer data for purposes other than law enforcement, such as to sell products to the customer or sell the customer's personal data to third parties. 
   I do not support the current know-your-customer proposals, because they do not include these and other privacy protections. 
   Unfortunately, the amendment before the Senate, in its zeal to condemn the proposed regulations, goes too far. The first section, which prohibits the banking agencies from finalizing the regulations as proposed in December, is fine. But the second section, which also prohibits them from publishing ``substantially similar'' regulations, is ambiguous and troubling. 
   It is my hope that the supporters of the amendment do not intend to reverse the gains of the last twenty years and free banks of any obligation to know who their customers are. It is my hope that their intent is to protect ordinary law-abiding customers, but to keep the heat on money launderers by maintaining longstanding requirements that banks ask appropriate questions. It is my hope that their intent to require the agencies to correct the flaws in the proposed regulations, but not block all know-your-customer regulations no matter how narrowly or carefully drawn. 
   The pending amendment could easily be clarified. However, given the current parliamentary situation, it is not clear that anyone will be permitted to offer the additional language. If no clarification is provided, I want the record to show that my support for the amendment is based on the understanding that the amendment's ban on ``substantially similar'' regulations is a ban on know-your-customer regulations that lack adequate privacy protections for ordinary, law abiding individuals. It is not a ban on all future know-your-customer regulations, no matter how carefully drafted. 
   Financial privacy is an important issue. It needs to be addressed. Senator SARBANES is working on a comprehensive financial privacy bill that I hope this body is given an opportunity to consider. It is unfortunate that we are being asked to address an important aspect of the financial privacy debate in such a rushed and inappropriate context. Which brings me back to Senator SARBANES' original question about why we are adding banking amendments to an education bill instead of the education amendments America wants and needs.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce today legislation to repeal the Jones Act waiver contained in last year's Coast Guard Authorization bill for the vessel Columbus. 
   Mr. President, I had serious objections to a provision in last year's Coast Guard Authorization bill that was inserted in the House bill in a managers' amendment with no hearings or vote in the Senate. This provision granted a waiver of existing law for a single vessel operating on the Great Lakes and elsewhere against the wishes of both Michigan Senators and other Senators and in circumvention of a Customs Service ruling regarding the type of dredge work this vessel is allowed to perform. 
   This waiver is a discriminatory provision which gives special treatment and a competitive advantage to one vessel at the expense of its competitors and it should be repealed. 
   Mr. President, the granting of this waiver is detrimental to other dredgers on the Great Lakes and elsewhere who are abiding by U.S. law and U.S. Customs Service interpretations of the Jones Act. The hopper dredge vessel Columbus, the vessel seeking the waiver, was challenged by a competitor for violating the Jones Act because it was performing dredging work that was not allowed under that Act. That challenge was upheld by the U.S. Customs Service. However, instead of abiding by or appealing the Customs Service ruling, a legislative waiver was sought to circumvent that ruling. The waiver was granted by the House, but not the Senate because the Senate passed Coast Guard authorization bill did not contain this discriminatory provision. 
   The only reason this waiver was included in the final Coast Guard authorization bill was due to the circumstances under which that bill was considered. Under normal circumstances, I believe the Senate would have removed this controversial provision from the final bill. 
   At the time of the Senate vote on the Coast Guard Authorization Conference Report, I engaged in a colloquy with my colleagues Senators SNOWE and MCCAIN. In that colloquy, they agreed to work with me to repeal this waiver as early as possible in 1999. The legislation I am introducing today with my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, will do exactly that.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the School Dropout Prevention and State Responsibilities Act which is aimed at lowering the student dropout rate in our nation's schools. We cannot have high expectations that our young people will be prepared for the challenges that lay ahead if they have not attained at least a high school diploma. The fact is that over half a million high school students drop out each year, joining almost 4 million young Americans who lack a high school diploma and are not in the process of getting one. 
   Mr. President, it is a bipartisan National Education Goal to increase high school completion rates to 90 percent and eliminate gaps in the rates of graduation among different groups, according to the goals established by the Governors and the President in 1989. However, there has been no progress in lowering national dropout rates. As a matter of fact, there is currently no targeted national funding to help schools most in need of restructuring to lower their dropout rates. 
   To help schools in their efforts to reduce dropout rates, this amendment would authorize $150 million annually over five years to create a coordinated national dropout prevention program. Under this proposal, States would receive funding according to the Title I formula, and would then award competitive grants to schools or local education districts with the highest dropout rates. The goal is to enable such schools to implement proven and widely replicated models of comprehensive dropout prevention reforms such as, for example, the Lansing School District in Michigan, which has established a mentoring program with community leaders and the ``New Beginnings'' program for students who have been expelled to keep them in school; and the Detroit Public Schools' successful 9th grade restructuring program which is advancing up to the higher school grades. 
   In addition, this amendment will create a national system of data collection and sharing, so that we have a complete understanding of the extent of the dropout problem. If local school districts are to curb middle and highschool dropout rates, they must have uniform data and statistics. This amendment, which creates a national clearinghouse and a dropout ``czar'' within the Department of Education, will give middle and high schools the tools they need to keep our youngsters in school. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is identical to the legislation that passed 74-26 by the Senate during debate last year on the education IRA proposal, and was, regrettably, dropped in conference. This is a very important proposal to help keep young Americans in school and it is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will again adopt this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator JOHN KERRY and Senator GORDON SMITH, in the amendment to establish the Excellent Principals Challenge Grant program, which seeks to address the critical professional development needs of elementary and secondary school principals. Last month, during a meeting with the Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals (MASSP), a major concern expressed by them was the lack of professional development programs for school principals. What the school principals of my State said was, just as with the teachers and students around them, they too must keep growing in order to continue to be effective leaders; and as individuals most responsible for implementing vision, direction, and focus for their schools, principals must be fortified with the best knowledge and skills required to effectively manage positive change, including being cognizant of the best ways in which to integrate technology into their schools so that it enhances learning in the classroom. 
   These are the views of the dedicated school principals of my State, including Jim Ballard, MASSP Executive Director, Sandy Feuerstein of Adams Elementary School in Livonia, Barbara Gadnes of Brighton Elementary School in Brighton, Jerry Dodd of Edsel Ford High School of Dearborn and Bob Cross of Troy Athens High School in Troy, Michigan. 
   This amendment would facilitate the professional development needs expressed by the principals of my State and principals nationwide. It would establish a competitive grant program to the States, to fund local school districts for implementation of professional development programs for K-12 school principals. Authorized funding would be $250 million for each of the years FY 2000-FY 2004. State and local school districts would be expected to contribute 25 percent of the total cost, with the exception of the poorest school districts that would be exempt from the match. In addition, a commission would be created to study existing principal development programs and report on the best practices to train principals nationwide. Activities would include developing management and business skills, knowledge of effective instructional skills and practices, and learning about educational technology, which has been a special focus of mine in Michigan where I've brought together colleges and universities and other entities in a partnership to move towards making Michigan's standards for teacher training in the use of technology the nation's best. 
   The expectations for our school principals are high. They are trusted to coordinate, assist and inspire teachers and students, while also monitoring their own personal growth. We must invest in our principals, who dedicate so much to investing in our children. This principal preparation program will allow principals to reach their full potential and at the same time, create public schools that are more organized, well-managed and modern. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Rosa Parks is truly one of this Nation's greatest heroes. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice have shaped our Nation's history and are remembered with respect and with reverence by us all. 
   Forty three years ago--December 1995--in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights movement began. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American people but the entire world. 
   My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our own. Rosa Parks and her husband made the journey to Michigan in 1957. Unceasing threats on their lives and persistent harassment by phone prompted the move to Detroit where Rosa Park's brother resided. 
   Rosa Park's arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day in 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and justice. For instance, twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's bus related segregation laws, which required African Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus then get off of the bus and re-board from the bus at the rear. The driver of that bus was the same driver with whom Rosa Parks would have her confrontation 12 years later. 
   The rest is history--the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 
   The Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. 
   We have come a long way towards achieving Dr. King's dream of justice and equality for all. But we still have much work to do. Let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle on Civil Rights, and to human rights in Rosa Parks name.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak to S. 346, legislation introduced by Senators BOB GRAHAM (D-Florida) and KAY BAILEY HUTCHINSON (R-Texas), which provides that the federal money obtained by the states in the tobacco settlements remains in the hands of the states. 
   Let me briefly review the history of why we are here today discussing tobacco recoupment. On November 23, 1998, 46 states, including my own state of Michigan, reached a $206 billion settlement with the major tobacco manufacturers. Michigan's share of the settlement is approximately $8.2 billion ($300 million per year over 25 years). States that entered into the settlement have begun to plan for the allocation of funds received under those agreements. 
   This settlement was the result of a great undertaking by the states. Over the last decade, state governments initiated lawsuits against the tobacco industry, asserting a variety of claims, including the violation of consumer fraud and other state consumer protection laws. Several state lawsuits did not include any claims for reimbursement of tobacco related health costs paid under the Medicaid program. Some states, such as Michigan, included Medicaid recovery as a part of its claim. 
   The Department of HHS claims a portion of the settlement represented by reimbursement of Medicaid costs it funded. However, because there were multiple bases for the state claims against the tobacco companies and because it would be difficult to accurately assess which portion of the states' settlement funds represents Medicaid reimbursement. I will support an amendment to this bill which will keep in the states any so called ``federal share'' funds if spent by the states on a variety of health and education related activities. 
   It is with the preceding in mind that I have joined on as a co-sponsor of S. 346. I urge the passage of S. 346, with an amendment along the lines described. This will hopefully expedite the process of these funds being used in a responsible and healthy manner.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the greatest Americans to serve our Nation in this Capitol in this century. 
   Mo Udall was a man of grace, humor and dignity. In this time in Washington when we have all suffered under the burden of too much partisanship and too much personal vitriol in our political life, it would serve us well to contemplate the life of Mo Udall. This is a man who fought hard for what he believed. This is a man who entered more than his share of bruising political battles and yet used his enormous wit to soften the edges and to civilize the struggle. More often than not, the butt of the humor was Mo Udall, himself. When we who work here in Washington take ourselves too seriously, we might remember Mo's explanation that he was ending his 1976 campaign for the Presidency after six second-place finishes in Democratic primaries ``because of illness. The voters got sick of me.'' He loved to quote Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir's warning, ``Don't be humble, you're not that great.'' 
   Mo Udall was both humble and great. Mo Udall's sense of humor was so much a part of his legacy that we sometimes forget his towering accomplishments as an environmentalist and reformer. I worked with Mo on one of his signal accomplishments the passage in 1980 of the Alaska Lands Act which more than doubled the size of the national park system and which President Jimmy Carter called ``the most important conservation legislation of the century''. Among his many successful efforts to protect our nation's environment was his decade-long battle in the 1970's to pass tough strip mining reclamation legislation. As Chairman of the House Interior Committee he repeatedly led efforts to expand the national park system and to protect the nation's wildlife, rivers, forests and wilderness areas. 
   Throughout his career, Mo Udall was in the front ranks of those who fought for accountability and reform in public office. He battled for campaign finance reforms, and reforms in the Congress itself, including financial disclosure, reform of the seniority system, and lobby reform. He was among the leaders of the fight in 1971 for the Federal Election Campaign Act, the first substantial revision of campaign financing laws since 1925. 
   In his 1988 book, ``Too Funny To Be President'', Mo Udall revealed that his ``guiding light'' came from Will Rogers: ``We are here for just a spell and then pass on. So get a few laughs and do the best you can. Live your life so that whatever you lose, you are ahead.'' 
   Mr. President, Morris ``Mo'' Udall is way, way ahead.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Defense Department and the Congress lost the services of an outstanding public servant when Sandi Stuart stepped down as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. 
   For the last six years, beginning in 1993, Sandi Stuart has served as the senior legislative advisor to three Secretaries of Defense--our former colleague the late Les Aspin; Dr. Bill Perry; and the current Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. During this time she has earned a well-deserved reputation as a skilled legislative strategist and an effective spokesperson for the Secretary of Defense and for the interests of the men and women in uniform and their families. 
   At the same time, because of her extensive experience over almost 15 years in senior staff positions in the House of Representatives, Sandi had tremendous credibility on Capitol Hill as someone who understood how Congress worked. She knew that to be successful working with Congress--particularly in the area of national security policy--requires an ability to work closely with members and staff on both sides of the aisle. She did that very well, and leaves the Defense Department with the respect and gratitude of Democratic and Republican members and staff alike. 
   Mr. President, I have worked closely with Sandi Stuart for the past six years on a broad range of national security policy issues. She has done an outstanding job of meeting the needs of the Armed Services Committee, and I have come to rely heavily on her advice and counsel. 
   Mr. President, Sandi Stuart has also become a good friend, and we will miss her. I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her service to the country, and to wish her continued success in the private sector as she leaves the Department of Defense.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Small Business Committee and cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased the Senate is acting expeditiously on S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. Making affordable government guaranteed loans available to small businesses to correct the computer problem associated with the Year 2000, or Y2K, is a critical part of that the federal government can do to ensure that all businesses can become Y2K compliant by the turn of the century. 
   As everyone knows by now, experts are concerned that on January 1, 2000, many computers will recognize a double zero not as the year 2000 but as the year 1900. This technical glitch could cause the computers to stop running altogether or start generating erroneous data. It is a serious problem that should be taken seriously by businesses, large and small. 
   Unfortunately, surveys show that many small businesses are not taking the action they should be taking to fix the problem and as a result could face costly consequences on January 1, 2000. According to recent research, nearly 25 percent of all businesses, of which 80 percent are small companies, have not begun to prepare for the serious system issues that are predicted to occur on January 1, 2000. 
   One of the reasons for this lack of preparedness by small businesses could be the lack of access to funds to pay for the needed repairs. That is why the Senate Small Business Committee reported by a unanimous vote this legislation to establish a special loan program for small businesses to pay for Y2K repairs. Our hope is to move this legislation expeditiously through the 106th Congress so that the special loan program established by this bill will be available in time to do Y2K repairs. The full extent of the year 2000 problem is unknown, but we can reduce the possibility of problems by taking action now. 
   System failures can be costly and that's why it's better to avoid them rather than fix them after failure. As we count down the remaining months of this century, let's give small businesses who have been the backbone of our great economic prosperity access to the funds they need to correct the Y2K computer bug. For many of our small businesses, S. 314 could help keep them from suffering severe financial distress or failure.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves, let me commend him for his remarks. I have many of the same concerns that he has expressed. I have tried to figure out the best way to address those concerns. I did not see support for addressing those concerns on the Senate floor, frankly, and, therefore have not attempted to address some of the ones that he mentioned. I hope they can be addressed in conference. I will be speaking to that later on this afternoon and tomorrow, because, in fact, budget points of order lie to many of the matters which have been raised by the Senator from Oklahoma. Yet, we don't have the Budget Committee here raising those points of order that lie. We will be again exploring that in some depth later on this afternoon, and indicating that if this comes back from conference with the same unpaid-for benefits, then points of order would still lie. I hope if it happens that the Budget Committee folks would see fit to raise points of order to lie under the Budget Act against the benefits that are not paid for; and that, if not, I will surely consider raising a point of order. What the Senator from Oklahoma said--I think I might be joining in that kind of an effort. 
   I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, hopefully, we will soon be voting on final passage of S. 4, the military pay and benefits bill. This bill would significantly improve the pay and benefits available to our troops and help address the military recruitment and retention problems identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   The bill includes an across-the-board increase in military salaries, targeted pay raises to reward performance, enhanced military retirement benefits for service members who entered after 1986, enhanced education benefits for service members under the GI bill, and numerous other benefits. These changes should help provide fairer compensation to our men and women in uniform, and I think we would all like to see them enacted into law. 
   As I pointed out previously, this is an extremely expensive bill, and it has not been paid for. This bill has not been paid for. When the bill came to the floor, it included provisions that would cost roughly $35 billion more than current law over the 6-year course of the future year defense plan, the so-called FYDP. These costs include close to $24 billion in pay and benefits enhancements that were funded in the administration budget but almost $12 billion more in enhancements that were added by the Armed Services Committee. 
   Since the bill has been in the Chamber, it has become even more expensive, with the addition of many amendments increasing the benefits for our men and women in uniform. These include provisions eliminating the prohibition on dual compensation, authorizing participation in the Thrift Savings Plan by members of the National Guard and Reserves, extending enhanced GI bill benefits to members of the National Guard and Reserves, expanding the use of GI bill benefits to cover preparation for college and graduate school entrance exams, and expanding the number of soldiers eligible for the $180 per month special subsistence allowance. 
   Moreover, we have adopted an amendment offered by the Senators from Maryland and Virginia expressing the sense of the Congress that we should extend the pay increases provided in this bill for members of the armed services to the Federal civilian employees as well. If we were to act in accordance with just that one provision, we would add an additional $3 billion in defense spending and an additional $7 billion in nondefense spending, for a total of almost $10 billion of Governmentwide spending over the next 6 years. 
   Now, these are worthwhile provisions which would provide real benefits to the men and women who so loyally serve our country every day, 
   but they have real costs attached to them, some in the hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Yet we have not said how we intend to pay for them. 
   Do we intend to revise the budget agreement to pay for the bill before us? If the defense budget is not substantially increased, for instance, we would then be faced with making deep cuts in the readiness and modernization accounts to pay for the changes proposed in this bill. Such cuts are coming at a time when our senior military leadership has already expressed concerns that our readiness could have a serious impact on our national security. For this reason, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that they would support the increased benefits contained in this bill only if the additional money does not come out of other defense programs. 
   For this reason, the Secretary of Defense wrote the Armed Services Committee last week to express strong concerns about the cost of this bill and how it would be paid for. Secretary Cohen wrote:

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair for the responses to those inquiries. 
   The fact that this bill violates the Budget Act in so many different ways helps to demonstrate the stark fact that there could be serious consequences from taking up this bill as we have, outside of the normal legislative cycle. Now, Mr. President, I share the desire of, I hope, all of our colleagues to do what we can to provide fairer compensation to our men and women in uniform, and to address the serious recruiting and retention problems which are faced by the services. However, if 
   the House acts on this measure and it is brought back to the Senate floor following a conference without paying for the benefits in this bill, many of the same points of order under the Budget Act would still apply. And so, if the Budget Committee members at that point fail to raise points of order which would be available to such a conference report if it comes back to the floor without being paid for, I would reserve the right at that time to raise those points of order. 
   I think it is very important that before this bill comes back to either House in the form of a conference report, that any benefits in this bill be paid for. No matter how much we want to enact these important provisions into law, at some point we are going to have to pay for them. That time needs to come before final passage of any conference report on this bill. So I want to alert my good friend from Virginia that although the points of order were not raised here--the Budget Committee members determined, apparently, not to raise such points of order even though the Budget Act is, in the first instance at least, theirs to enforce--any of us can enforce it. 
   Any member of the Budget Committee, I would think, would have a special responsibility to make sure that we comply with the Budget Act. Each one of us has our own reasons for not raising a point of order. Each one of us could do so at this time. 
   I am willing to vote to permit this bill to take its next step without raising a point of order. However, if this bill is passed by the House, goes to conference, and comes back with benefits not being paid for, it would then be my intention at that time to consider raising points of order, and hopefully the Budget Committee would consider whether or not, in fact, the Budget Act maintenance doesn't require such points of order to be made before this bill actually is sent to the President. 
   I thank the Chair for his rulings and for his cooperation in response to my question. Again, I thank my good friend from Virginia for all of his effort on this bill. Even though we do have some problems with having a bill with such a large amount of money in it that is not paid for, nonetheless, I, as one Senator and ranking member, am willing to have it proceed to the House with the caveat I have just shared with my colleagues.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Florida for the determination which he has always shown to pay our bills, not to create additional burdens, debt burdens on our children and grandchildren, to protect the Social Security surplus, and to do what is right in terms of fiscal responsibility. 
   His amendment is an important amendment. It would make this bill much sounder in terms of paying for the benefits that we have in this bill. I commend him for that vision and for his determination. I hope that his amendment is not tabled. But I just want to commend him for putting, in very specific amendment form, a way in which we can pay for these benefits now instead of just expressing the hope that they will be paid for later. 
   If we follow that course, of course, the points of order which were referred to before would not be in order, which would be just fine with me. It also would guarantee that the benefits which we now say we want to provide to the men and women in service--in fact, are not guaranteed, but make it more likely to guarantee that those benefits would, in fact, flow down the road. And it is because of that additional assurance which would be given the men and women through the passage of that amendment that I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Florida.

It has to be further amended, because we want to make sure that in the event there is a point of order--we don't know whether there will be one or not--but in the event there is a point of order, that a motion to waive that point of order would be debatable. I don't know that there will. But the Budget Committee folks are now apparently in a hearing. We can't get an answer from them as to whether or not there is an interest in making a point of order, assuming one lies. And I am not sure we even know yet whether or not a point of order lies. But we want to protect the rights of those Members. 
   So in order to do that, we have to protect the rights of anyone to make a point of order and to debate a motion to waive that point of order. That is being written.

   Mr. LEVIN. I generally support the thrust of the Senator's amendment. But I also want to make sure that it accomplishes its goal in the Congress too. 
   One of the issues which has been raised is whether or not the amendment addresses the administrative cap that exists on salaries here in the Senate, and I understand there is a similar 
   administrative cap that exists in the House as well. That is one of the issues as to whether or not changing the law here will, in effect, accomplish the purpose or then just create another inconsistency between Congress and the executive branch. 
   So that is one issue which perhaps the Senator can address. The other issue is just the concern that I have as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee which is that we should give that committee an opportunity to take a look at this amendment, because there is a civil service aspect to this which they may have some feelings about and we were trying to see whether or not there is any desire on the part of either the chairman, ranking member of Governmental Affairs, or anyone else on that committee to speak on this amendment. We have been unable to ascertain that. 
   But taking the first question first, I am wondering whether or not the Senator would comment on the question whether or not his amendment would address the current administrative cap that exists on staff salaries here in the Senate.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Virginia will address this issue as well. We have an administrative cap on staff salaries here in the Senate, and this amendment does not address that administrative cap. So we would be correcting one problem. 
   I happen to support the thrust of that, which is that we would not be putting our active duty retirees at a disadvantage compared to our Reserve retirees. But we are also creating, in a sense, another inequality because the executive branch now would have no restriction administratively, whereas we apparently will retain this administrative cap. 
   So I am concerned about that inequity that would be created between ourselves and the executive branch with the passage of this, and I simply want to point it out. I think the direction here is the right one. But I do think we are facing another inequity. We are creating, in effect, another equity by eliminating the executive branch statutory cap and eliminating our statutory cap, leaving in place the administrative cap that is already in there.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia for that response. I wonder if the Senator from Idaho has discussed with the persons who were involved actively in placing that administrative cap in the--relative to the issue of removing that cap, have there been any discussions and, if so, could he share those perhaps with the Senate.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment the chairman will be propounding a unanimous consent request which I will support. 
   I do want to have one caveat on it, however, and that is that the Governmental Affairs members, as far as I know, have not had an opportunity to review this. This is within their jurisdiction; it affects civil service, and I think we should alert--I am hereby alerting them that there would be a vote on this matter at 2:15--and I think that in the event that a member of that committee, or anyone else for that reason, that it is within the jurisdiction of another committee, wanted to speak on this amendment before it were adopted, I would support a request from such a member to have an opportunity to speak for a brief amount of time prior to the vote. It would require a change in the unanimous consent agreement, and I am going to support this unanimous consent agreement so we can sequence some votes at 2:15, but I do want to alert our colleagues particularly on the Governmental Affairs Committee that this is an amendment within their jurisdiction, and if any member of that committee or any other member wants to speak to it for that reason, that this is not in the jurisdiction of Armed Services but a different committee, I would support--that doesn't mean it will succeed, but I will support a modification in our unanimous consent agreement at 2:15 to permit a short period of time for such amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to alert our colleagues to a fact which was not clear the last time we spoke on the subject of this amendment which we just adopted. There was not certainty as to whether that amendment would have been subject to a point of order had a point of order been made. We protected that possibility in our unanimous consent agreement in the event the Parliamentarian ruled that it would have been subject to a point of order. 
   In fact, we now understand that it would have been subject to a point of order, and therefore we have now another provision in the bill that is in violation of the Budget Act because it is not paid for. That is something which we should really be very conscious of as we go along here and very concerned about. 
   But we did protect our colleagues in the event that that was the ruling, and none of our colleagues decided to raise the point of order. But in fact it could have been raised. And we should take very serious note of any of the violations of the Budget Act as we proceed, because at some point we are going to have to pay for the amendments we add as well as the bill itself. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Wyoming for his amendment. It is a very good amendment. It equalizes the Army and the Air Force with what already exists for the Navy and the Marines. The reason we should equalize it is because when our Army and Air Force personnel are deployed, they are effectively in the same situation and need this tuition assistance to the same extent that the Navy and the Marines already have it authorized. As Senator ALLARD said, it is discretionary with our service secretaries. That means that it hopefully will be accomplished and hopefully can be done within their budgets but does not raise a Budget Act problem. 
   I commend our friend from Wyoming, and we support the amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also commend Senator HAGEL for his speech. He inevitably is on the floor when we have a defense authorization bill or an item related closely to it, as this bill is. He is here, fervently urging support of our men and women in our uniformed military. I just want to say that voice is a particularly powerful voice, given Senator HAGEL's background. I again compliment him and thank him for the ongoing commitment. He has not forgotten where he came from, as we sometimes say, and it is very important that we hear such strong voices as Senator HAGEL's.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I am on my feet, if I could also thank Senator ROBB for the previous amendment. I was not here. I had to leave for a moment. But it is a very important amendment which we just adopted. We did it in a few moments, but this increased special and incentive pay provision that Senator ROBB has now inserted in this bill is targeted at critical specialties where services are having a significant retention problem. It is very important that we do that. 
   This provision was in the budget which was submitted to us, but it was not included in this pay bill. It should have been. I think it was a significant oversight that it was not. That oversight has been corrected by Senator ROBB, who is here, as always, watching very, very closely and carefully to make sure that we do the right thing by our troops and by our defense and by our security needs. I thank him for determining that this was left out of a bill which is aimed at supporting our troops, and should not have been. Because of his energy and his perception, it is now back in the bill. I thank him for it.

   Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me, again, commend our friend from Virginia for his leadership in this area. This is one of our greatest areas of shortfall. It is one of our greatest retention problems. We have to try to do better to retain our pilots, and this amendment will go a long way, indeed, the administration proposal--hopefully it is in their proposal--will go, we believe at least, some way in terms of retaining pilots as its goal. It is a very important goal. 
   I, again, thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership in zeroing in on some of the greatest problems that we face in our defense budget, and that is the retention problem of pilots. So we very strongly support this amendment.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate our good friend from Minnesota for this amendment. This is a very, very, perceptive amendment. 
   What he is doing here is requiring that the Comptroller General make a study in a report to the Department of Defense on policies that would protect the confidentiality of communications between military dependents who are victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault or intrafamily abuse or who have engaged in such misconduct; and therapists, counselors and advocates from whom the victim seeks professional services. The Senator has pointed out that without this confidentiality, the victims of this kind of abuse and behavior are a lot less likely to use what is available to them in terms of counseling, medical services and protection. This becomes a very essential ingredient in protecting the victims of this kind of abuse. Without this confidentiality, we don't have the necessary protection that will give the assurance to these victims. 
   I want to commend Senator WELLSTONE and Senator MURRAY for this amendment. I hope it has prompt and swift approval of this body.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if there is a moment, I wish to commend the Senator from Texas and the Senator from North Carolina again on their amendment. The DOD has been working hard to improve the delivery of medical care through the TRICARE program. This amendment gives strong encouragement to the Secretary of Defense to broaden the services which were provided under the TRICARE system. It is important that these services be provided to military members and their families. It is important to improve the claims and the reimbursement process, and to make benefits under the TRICARE program uniform across the country. So, again, I thank the Senators from Texas and North Carolina and their supporters for their leadership on this issue.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Members of this body are keenly aware of the demands we place on our troops, the circumstances in which they live and work and the fact we often pay them less and expect them to do far more than employers in the private sector. 
   I commend Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for recognizing that military recruitment and retention has begun to suffer and for acting forcefully to address this problem. 
   The fiscal year 2000 defense budget includes funding for an across-the-board increase in military salaries, targeted pay raises to better reward performance, and a change to the military retirement system to place service members who entered after 1986 on a footing more comparable to those who entered the service at an earlier date. These changes should help provide fairer compensation to our men and women in uniform, and we should act together to enact them into law. 
   The bill before us contains provisions similar to those proposed by Secretary Cohen's budget, but there are several ways in which the benefits offered by S. 4 are even more generous. It includes the following: First, the administration proposal contains a 4.4-percent across-the-board pay increase. S. 4 contains a 4.8-percent pay raise. 
   Second, the administration budget assumes, but does not require, pay raises of 3.9 percent a year for the remainder of the FYDP. S. 4 mandates in permanent law raises of .5 percent more than the employment cost index. 
   Third, the administration proposal would restore the same 50 percent of base pay for post-1986 retirees as for pre-1986 retirees. S. 4 would provide the same change while also restoring the more generous pre-1986 full CPI COLAs. Under S. 4, post-1986 retirees could accept a one-time, lump-sum payment of $30,000 and opt out of this generous retirement system. 
   Fourth, S. 4 authorizes active duty service members to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees. The administration proposal contained no similar provision. 
   Fifth, S. 4 contains a special allowance for service members who are eligible to receive food stamps. The administration proposal contained no similar provision. 
   And sixth, S. 4 contains provisions first proposed by Senator CLELAND and consistent with the recommendations of the Congressional Commission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance to improve the educational benefits provided to service members through the GI bill. The administration proposal contained no similar provision. 
   I have some concerns about a number of these provisions, but there is little doubt that they would substantially improve the pay and benefits available to members of the Armed Forces. The GI bill provisions, in particular, should provide substantial incentives to help address the current recruiting and retention problems facing the military services, while offering our men and women in uniform an educational opportunity in the proudest tradition of our country. 
   For this reason, I agree with the sponsors of the bill that we should do what we can to make these benefits a reality. So on that question, I hope there is no Member of this body, and I know there is no member of the Armed Services Committee not in agreement that we should do what we can to make these benefits in S. 4 a reality. 
   But the question is, How can we best make that happen. Do we best serve the interests of the troops by bringing this bill to the floor for consideration before we have passed a budget resolution and before we know whether money will be available to pay for this bill? Do we best serve our troops by separating the pay and the benefits issues from the rest of the authorization, even if that can force us to delay improvements in living and working conditions, and even if that forces us to postpone the introduction of new equipment? Or would we better serve the interest of our troops by considering the provisions of this bill in our normal authorization process after the budget resolution has been passed and we have had an opportunity to conduct hearings on the specifics of the proposal in our Personnel Subcommittee? 
   Madam President, I want to alert my colleagues that regardless of whether we pass this bill now or later, we will have to face up to some significant issues down the road. Our military leaders have told us that they want us to change the military retirement system, but the proposals in S. 4 are very different from their proposal. Indeed, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton recently testified that they would support the added benefits in this bill only if--and I emphasize only if--they are paid for without cutting into other defense programs. At this point in the legislative cycle, before we have agreed upon a budget, we cannot give them that assurance, and we cannot give our troops that assurance. 
   For this reason, the Secretary of Defense wrote the committee last Friday to express strong concerns about whether this bill could be paid for without an adverse impact on national defense. My good friend, Senator WARNER, has read the letter, but I am just going to focus on a couple of paragraphs in that letter because of Secretary Cohen's concerns about whether this bill could be paid for without an adverse impact on the national defense. 
   Here is what Secretary Cohen wrote in part:

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I agree with my good friend from Virginia in terms of the need to both attract and retain people. It is also important that we pay for the benefits in this bill. 
   We are not doing anybody a favor if we say we are going to increase the pay, and then we cut their housing. We are not doing anybody a favor if we say there will be an added pay increase to what the President proposes, and then cut flying hours and steaming hours so that people don't have the training that they want as members of the military. 
   I don't know of anybody who is more keenly aware of the need to both recruit and retain people than our Secretary of Defense. I can't think of anybody other than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Chiefs themselves who are more keenly aware of these shortfalls. That is why we have these increases in the President's budget. But the Secretary of Defense, who is responsible for increasing recruitment and retention, has proposed a budget to us which he believes will do just that. He says in his letter to both the chairman and to me:  
   ..... it is imperative to proceed within the regular authorization process and after we have agreement on a budget topline.  
   The reason he said that is because, ``It could be counterproductive and completely contrary to our mutual desire not to undercut our modernization effort and other readiness priorities'' to do otherwise. 
   So in terms of the benefits in this bill, I am not one who is criticizing the benefits in this bill at all. I commend these benefits. I just want to pay for them. That is the only issue. Whether we are going to pay for these benefits or we are just going to say in a bill that these benefits are going to be increased, without knowing where the increase is coming from, without knowing whether the budget resolution is going to put more money in for defense, without knowing whether or not these increases in benefits, this pay, and retirement are going to come out of readiness, modernization, housing, or where they will come from in there is not a top line. 
   The benefits, it seems to me, are appropriate. But paying for them is essential, or else we are going to unleash two things. One is false hopes, which will then be dashed, which 
   is, it seems to me, the worst of all worlds--false hopes in our uniformed military people that they will be getting a pay raise larger than the one proposed by the President. Or we are going to be carrying through with the provisions of this bill, and unless there is an increase in the top line, we will be seeing a degradation in readiness or modernization or housing or other important needs, both of the Nation and of our uniformed military personnel. 
   So I am very supportive of the benefits in this bill. What I am pointing out is the missing part of this bill. This is half a bill. This isn't a full bill. This is half of the bill. This is increasing the benefits but it is not saying how we will pay for those benefits. It is half the ledger without the other half of the ledger. That is the problem with this bill. 
   It seems to me what we should do is what the Secretary of Defense has suggested, which is to make these benefits part of the overall authorization bill, which is where they belong and where, traditionally, they have always been lodged and where they have always been considered. 
   We, hopefully, can provide these benefits. I hope and pray we can provide these benefits. They are useful benefits. But we have to pay for them or else we are not doing the responsible and thoughtful thing. We must pay for them as the Secretary of Defense has urged us to do. Otherwise, in his words,  
   I am concerned that S. 4 could have the opposite effect by raising hopes that could not be fulfilled until the final budget number is set.  
   And the ``opposite effect'' that he is referring to is addressing the legitimate needs of service members regarding pay and retirement. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, first a personal note to our leaders: How proud I am of them, and we all are of you, for holding us together during this very, very difficult time. We will all be closer for having come through this, regardless of what this vote is or how we individually vote. 
   The burden of proof on the House that the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office is a heavy burden, because the effect is so dire in a democracy that depends upon the election of the President. In my judgment, the House of Representatives has not carried that burden of proof as to the specific allegations against the President. The House repeatedly relies on inferences while ignoring direct testimony to the contrary. There is nothing unusual about the reliance on inferences. It happens in trials all the time. What is unusual here is that the House's case relies on inferences from the testimony of people whose direct testimony contradicts the inference. Let me just cite some examples in the obstruction of justice article. 
   First, the House managers in their report, in their brief, made the following statements: ``As evidenced by the  testimony of Monica Lewinsky, the President encouraged her to lie.'' That is the words of the House brief. Second, ``The testimony of Monica Lewinsky leads to the conclusion that it was the President who initiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence.'' Third, ``The President needed the signature of Monica Lewinsky on the false affidavit and that was assured by the efforts to secure her a job.'' 
   Those are all direct quotes. Each one of those relies on inferences. Each one of them is contradicted by the explicit testimony of people from whom those inferences are drawn. 
   Let's just take them one by one. The House managers' inference that the President ``encouraged''--that is their word--Monica Lewinsky to lie was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's proffer, which was then incorporated into her grand jury testimony, that the President ``never'' encouraged her to lie. That is her word. They say by inference the President encouraged her to lie. She says, ``The President never encouraged me to lie.'' 
   The House managers' inference that it was, ``President Clinton who initiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence on December the 28th,'' was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's direct testimony that she initiated the concealment of the gifts. It is uncontested that on December 22 she took some of the gifts and concealed the rest--some of the gifts to her lawyer's office. She decided on her own that she would not turn over the gifts in response to that subpoena because they would embarrass her, or they would, in her words, disclose that there was a special relationship. So on the 22nd she decided on her own to withhold some of the gifts. And yet we are told by the managers by inference that somehow or other it is the President who initiated the withholding and the concealment of the gifts. 
   And then on the 28th, when they met at the White House, it was Monica Lewinsky who said, ``Maybe I should get some of the gifts to Betty.'' She initiated the issue. And then the President said either nothing or, ``Let me think about it.'' And then the question came up: Well, who then made the phone call relative to the pickup of the gifts? Was it Monica Lewinsky calling Betty Currie or was it Betty Currie calling Monica Lewinsky? 
   And here is where another inference is drawn, that if in fact it was Betty Currie who initiated the call, then the inference is that the President told Betty Currie to call Monica Lewinsky. There is a conflict there between Betty Currie and Monica Lewinsky. 
   But one of the most intriguing issues in this whole matter, one that I have really given a lot of thought to, is the question: Why would the President give Monica Lewinsky gifts on December 28 if he was concerned about it and wanted to withhold and hide the gifts? It is one of the questions that didn't get a lot of focus up here, by the way. 
   The President gave Monica Lewinsky at least three things that day: That bear carving that Dale Bumpers referred to that came from Vancouver, a small blanket, and a stuffed animal. 
   Now, here is the way the House addressed that issue. They asked themselves in their brief the question: Why would the President give Ms. Lewinsky gifts at the same time he was asking her to conceal others that he had already given her? Answer from the House in their brief: The only logical inference--only logical inference--is that the gifts, including the bear, symbolizing strength, were a tacit reminder to Ms. Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship even in the face of a Federal subpoena. That is the inference that they say is the only logical inference from giving three gifts to Monica Lewinsky, including a bear. 
   Now, there is a real problem with that. First of all, that bear was obtained by the President in Vancouver weeks before there was a witness list. We are not even offered speculation as to how the President could foresee that Monica Lewinsky would be on a witness list and pick up a symbol of strength while in Vancouver so that he could give it to her as a reminder to deny their relationship in the face of some future, unforeseen Federal subpoena. 
   But even more to the point, Monica Lewinsky was asked directly at the grand jury--directly--this question as to whether or not she interpreted the gift of that bear as a signal to her to ``be strong in your decision to conceal the relationship.'' Her direct, one-word answer was ``No.'' And yet the managers come here saying the only logical inference that can be drawn from three gifts being given from the President on the 28th is that the President was signaling to her to be strong in the face of a Federal subpoena. That is the kind of inference we are asked to draw. 
   Now, I was raised on the burden of proof, both as a prosecutor in civil rights cases and as a defense lawyer. The House cannot carry the burden of proof on the critical allegations of criminal misconduct that they have made when they depend on those kinds of inferences, a pile of inferences that 
   run directly contrary to direct testimony on critical points. Impeachment and removal should be based on sturdier foundations than that kind of a heap of inferences. They would have us overlook the forest of direct testimony while getting lost in the trees of their multiple inferences. 
   The December 11 issue has been discussed here. It was extraordinary to me, listening here as both factfinder and judge, that it could be represented to us that on December 11 the first activity calculated to actually help Monica Lewinsky get a job occurred. That is what they alleged on the floor of the Senate. The first activity--these are their words--calculated to help Ms. Lewinsky actually get a job took place on December 11, and that something happened on that day to trigger Vernon Jordan's meeting and real activity. Something happened that day. What was it? Judge Wright's order. 
   In their House brief, it is said that that order came in the morning, which was wrong, and in the presentation here in the opening arguments Manager HUTCHINSON said the following: ``The witness list came in, the judge's order came in. That triggered the President to action. And the President triggered Vernon Jordan into action. That chain reaction here is what moved the job search along.'' 
   Wrong. It disintegrated here. Vernon Jordan's meeting was before the judge's order. And yet that is what we are asked to base the removal of a President on. And then the thinking shifts to another theory. Removal of an elected President from office has got to be made of sturdier stuff than those kinds of inferences. 
   Finally, on the double standard issue--and I think we all must be concerned about that--a former prosecutor who appeared in front of the House said the following. And Senator SARBANES quoted one line of this, and I want to repeat that, because it is so important, and then add one other thing that they said. ``In conversations with many current and former Federal prosecutors in whose judgment I have great faith, virtually all concur that if the President were not involved, if an ordinary citizen were the subject of the inquiry, no serious consideration would be given to a criminal prosecution arising from alleged misconduct in discovery in the Jones civil case having to do with an alleged coverup of a private sexual affair with another woman or the follow-on testimony before the grand jury. I believe the President should be treated in the criminal justice system in the same way as any other United States citizen. 
   ``If that were the case here,'' these former prosecutors said, ``it is my view that the alleged obstruction of justice and perjury would not be prosecuted by a responsible U.S. attorney.'' 
   I know this is not a criminal case, this is an impeachment trial, but I would think that our standards should be at least as high as would be in a criminal case, and that if this President would not be prosecuted, much less convicted for these specific charges--and these were criminal charges that were very specifically made by the managers against the President--if that prosecution and conviction would not take place in a criminal case, we should be loathe, I believe, and very, very cautious and careful before we remove an elected President from office. 
   I learned about the burden of proof and presumption of innocence as a young boy, long before law school, when my father, who was a lawyer, taught me that American justice is dependent on these principles. As I grew up and became a lawyer myself, I experienced firsthand the significance of  these bedrock principles and learned that it applies to all Americans accused of crimes, including the President. These principles of the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence help guide me now as we exercise our constitutional duty to judge the specific accusations of criminal behavior lodged against the President of the United States. 
   The burden of proof on the House of Representatives that the President has committed serious crimes and should be removed from office is a heavy one, because overturning an election in a democracy is a drastic and dire action. The House has not carried that burden of proof as to the specific accusations against the President. 
   The arguments of the House Managers in support of the Articles suffer from fundamental weaknesses. They repeatedly rely on inferences while ignoring direct testimony to the contrary; they omit key materials which contradict their charges; and they contain serious misstatements of key facts. In a matter of such consequence as the removal of an elected President from office, such a case should not lead to conviction. 
   Let me cite some key examples from Article II, the allegation of obstruction of justice. First, the House Managers in their report, brief, and arguments to the Senate repeatedly rely on inferences to prove key points and ignore direct testimony to the contrary. In opening arguments, House Manager HUTCHINSON made the following claims:  
   As evidenced by the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, [the President] encouraged her to lie. 
   ......(T)he testimony of Monica Lewinsky ..... leads to the conclusion that it was the President who initiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence.  
   .....The President needed the signature of Monica Lewinsky on the false affidavit, and that was assured by the efforts to secure her a job.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Judge Laurence E. Howard. On February 26, 1999, Judge Howard will  retire after 23 years of service to the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Michigan. 
   Judge Howard's history of public service is truly deserving of recognition. After serving his country in the Army during the Korean War, he received his Juris Doctor degree from Notre Dame in 1961. He then embarked upon a short career in the private sector, and in 1961, he returned to the public arena as Assistant City Attorney of Grand Rapids, Michigan. A couple of years later, he decided to return to private practice, but in 1968, the call of public service encouraged him to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Though his bid for office was unsuccessful, he remained active in local politics over the next several years. In 1976, he was appointed to the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Michigan. For the last 23 years, Judge Howard has served with integrity and compassion. 
   His departure from the bench will certainly mark a new chapter in his life. I am confident that it will be as successful as his law career. Though he plans to remain active in the Grand Rapids area, he will surely enjoy spending more time with Marilyn, his wife of over forty years, his four children and sixteen grandchildren. I am pleased to join his colleagues, friends and family in offering my thanks for all he has done. 
   Mr. President, Judge Laurence E. Howard can take pride in his long career of honor and dedication to the public. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting Judge Howard's commitment to his community, his country and the law, and in wishing him well in his retirement.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Michigan State University basketball program, which is celebrating 100 years of excellence this year. 
   The MSU fight song begins, ``On the banks of the Red Cedar, Is a school that's known to all, Its specialty is winning, And those Spartans play good ball.....'' Any basketball fan who has watched the Spartans on the court throughout their history knows just how good they have been. Who could forget the wizardry of Lansing, Michigan's own Earvin Johnson, who performed ``magic'' every time he stepped onto the court? Or the deft shooting touch of Big Ten scoring champion Mike Robinson? Or the dapper sensibility of legendary coach Jud Heathcote, who coached Michigan State to a national championship in 1979? In all, the MSU men's basketball team has won seven Big Ten championships, one national title, and has made ten consecutive post-season tournament appearances. Forty-five Spartans have been drafted by the National Basketball Association, fifteen have been honored as first-team All-Americans, and four have been Big Ten Player of the Year. 
   This year's Spartans basketball team is living up to the standards set by the heroes of the past. They are currently in first place in the Big Ten and are ranked fourth in the nation. Under the leadership of their coach, Iron Mountain, Michigan native Tom Izzo, the Spartans are roaring into the post-season ready for the challenges ``March Madness'' will bring. Like countless basketball fans nationwide, I am looking forward to watching Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and the rest of the team add another national championship to the Michigan State trophy collection. 
   Michigan State's athletes, whether they compete in basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, football, or any of MSU's athletic programs, also deserve recognition for their outstanding achievements in the classroom. More than three hundred of MSU's student athletes had 3.0 cumulative grade point averages as of the fall semester. One hundred seventy-eight were on the  Dean's List. And thirty-nine had 4.0 grade point averages. Now, thanks to the unprecedented generosity of a former Spartan basketball player, MSU's student athletes will have access to some of the finest academic support facilities in the country. Steve Smith, Michigan State's all-time leading scorer and current NBA star, recently gave $2.5 million to MSU to build the Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Center, named for Steve's late mother. The Center serves the more than 800 students who play varsity sports at Michigan State. Athletes are able to take advantage of tutoring and mentoring programs, computer literacy training and career development sessions. The Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Center is truly a powerful symbol of Michigan State's commitment to the academic success of its athletes. 
   Mr. President, Michigan State basketball has brought pride to the students and alumni of that great university, as well as to the people of Michigan. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Michigan State's students, alumni and faculty as it celebrates 100 years of basketball excellence.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to one of the most eagerly anticipated holidays each year in my home state of Michigan, Paczki Day. 
   The day before Lent is known in other parts of the country as Fat Tuesday or Mardi Gras, but in Metro Detroit and in other Michigan communities we celebrate Paczki Day. Paczkis, which are similar to jelly-filled doughnuts, were introduced to Metro Detroit by new immigrants from Poland who settled in the city of Hamtramck, Michigan. Today, thanks to the people of Hamtramck, Michigan is the paczki capital of the United States, with several million dozen paczkis sold every year. The Detroit Free Press reported that in 1993, paczki sales totaled  $7 to $8 million, which, as the Free Press reported, was ``.....not bad for a one-day holiday with a three-day selling period.'' 
   Paczki Day is a little like St. Patrick's Day. It is said that on St. Patrick's Day, everyone is a little bit Irish no matter what their family's background actually is. Well, on Paczki Day in Hamtramck and throughout Metro Detroit, we are all a little bit Polish. I look forward to celebrating my own ``Polish heritage'' with the people of Hamtramck on Paczki Day this year.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend Senator MCCAIN in submitting this resolution designating May 1999 as ``National Military Appreciation Month.'' Senator MCCAIN is one of the great champions in the Senate of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. It is a privilege to join him in sponsoring this resolution. 
   Day after day, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines continue to demonstrate a high degree of excellence and commitment. No matter what we ask of them, they always respond in the most professional manner imaginable. We have asked them to serve in combat operations, in peacekeeping missions, and in humanitarian relief efforts. We have deployed them around the world to stand in the face of aggression. They make tremendous personal sacrifices to serve their nation. 
   The most recent example of the excellence and professionalism of our forces was Operation Desert Fox. Over 40,000 troops deployed from bases around the world in response to Sadam Hussain's flagrant defiance of UN authorized inspections. Without a single U.S. or British casualty, our troops flew more than 600 aircraft sorties, 300 of them a night. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines all participated in this flawless operation. This same excellence has been demonstrated in Bosnia, Korea, Central America, and every other place where our members serve. 
   Our troops are, quite simply, the best. They are the best trained, best equipped, best disciplined and most highly skilled and motivated military force in the world. They deserve the recognition of a grateful Nation. This resolution calls on all Americans to recognize and honor their dedication and service. It is the least we can do.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maine for her leadership, her kind words, and for her bill, which I am proud to cosponsor. The bill I am introducing today, with her support and the support of Senator DURBIN, addresses the same kinds of practices. These two bills together, if adopted, would go a long way toward addressing the deceptive mailing practices that we see under the general heading of ``sweepstakes.'' 
   The bill that I am introducing, with the cosponsorship of Senator COLLINS and Senator DURBIN, will help eliminate the deceptive practices in mailings that use games of chance, like sweepstakes, to induce consumers to purchase a product that they may not need and to play a game that they will not win. 
   I originally introduced this bill last year. It was not enacted. It was introduced late in the session. I am very hopeful that this bill and Senator COLLINS' bill will be enacted this year following the hearings that she has just described--important hearings which I commend our chairman of the subcommittee for scheduling, for initiating. 
   The bill that I am introducing--this part of the remedy for the current abuses--will stiffen the penalties for deceptive mailings, will give the Postal Service administrative subpoena power, will restrict the use of misleading language and symbols, and require better disclosure about chances of winning and statements that no purchase is necessary to win. 
   The elderly are easy prey for the gimmicks used in these kinds of contests, such as a large notice declaring the recipient a winner--oftentimes a ``guaranteed'' winner or one of two final competitors for a large cash prize--and these gimmicks have proliferated to the point that American consumers are being duped into purchasing products they don't want or need because they think they have won or will win a big prize if they do so. Complaints about these mailings are one of the top ten consumer complaints in the nation. I have received numerous complaints from my constituents in Michigan asking that something be done to provide relief from these very misleading mailings. 
   In early September 1998, we held a hearing in our Governmental Affairs Committee federal services subcommittee on the problem of deceptive sweepstakes and other mailings involving games of chance. We learned from three of our witnesses, the Florida Attorney General, the Michigan Assistant Attorney General and the Postal Inspection Service, that senior citizens are particular targets of these deceptive solicitations, because they are the most vulnerable. State Attorneys General have taken action against many of the companies that use deceptive mailings. The states have entered into agreements to stop the most egregious practices, but the agreements apply only to the states that enter into the agreements. This allows companies to continue their deceptive practices in other states. That's one reason why federal legislation in this area is needed. The bill I'm introducing today will help eliminate deceptive practices by prohibiting misleading statements, requiring more disclosure, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty for each deceptive mailing, and providing the Postal Service with additional tools to pursue deceptive and fraudulent offenders. 
   Sweepstakes solicitations are put together by teams of clever marketers who package their sweepstakes offers in such a way so as to get people to purchase a product by implying that the chances of winning are enhanced if the product being offered is purchased. 
   That is not allowed. You cannot require that a purchase be made in order to win a prize. But these deceptive practices are such and they are so finely honed that, no matter what the fine print says about no purchase being necessary, the recipient of the mailing often is led to believe, by the nature of the mailing, that a purchase indeed will enhance the opportunity to win the prize. Senator COLLINS addresses the sum of those issues in her bill. 
   Rules and important disclaimers are written in fine print and hidden away in obscure sections of the solicitation or on the back of the envelope that is frequently tossed away. Even when one can find and read the rules, it frequently takes a law degree to understand them.  
   The bill I am introducing will help to protect consumers from deceptive practices by directing the Postal Service to develop and issue regulations that restrict the use of misleading language and symbols in direct mail game of chance solicitations, including sweepstakes. The bill also requires additional disclosure about chances of winning and the statement that no purchase is necessary. Any mail that is designated by the Postal Service as being deceptive will not be delivered. This will significantly reduce the deceptive practices being used in the direct mail industry to dupe unsuspecting consumers into thinking they are grand prize winners. The direct mail industry also would benefit, in that the adverse publicity recently aimed at the industry because of ``You Have Won a Prize'' campaigns has maligned the industry as a whole. Cleaning up deceptive advertising could improve the industry's image. 
   For those entities that continue to use deceptive mailings, my bill imposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for each piece of mail that violates Postal Service regulations. Currently the Postal Service can impose a fine for noncompliance with a Postal Service order. My bill imposes a fine whether or not the order actually has been issued. This has the effect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not for noncompliance with the order. 
   My bill also allows the Postal Service to quickly respond to changes in deceptive marketing practices by giving the Postal Service the authority to draft regulations that will be effective against the ``scheme du jour.'' A deceptive practice used today, may not be used tomorrow. As soon as the Post Office learns about one scheme, it changes. If legislation is passed that requires a specific notice, it can take just a short time before another deceptive practice pops up to by-pass the legislation. My bill gives the Postal Service the authority to evaluate what regulatory changes will be required to keep pace with the ever changing deceptive practices. This will help weed out deceptive practices in a timely manner. 
   The bill also gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power to respond more quickly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. Currently the Postal Service must go through a lengthy administrative procedure before it can get evidence to shut down illegal operations. 
   Currently the $10,000 fine--and civil penalty which exists--can only be imposed for noncompliance with a Postal Service order. There has to be an order issued which is violated before there can even be a civil fine. Our bill would impose a fine for violating the law, a penalty for perpetrating the deceptive offense or practice, and it would not require that there be an order previously entered. 
   By the time the Postal Service gets through all the administrative hoops, the sweepstakes promoter may have folded up operations and disappeared, or has destroyed all the evidence. By granting the Postal Service limited subpoena authority to obtain relevant material records for an investigation, the Postal Service will be able to act more efficiently against illegal activities. Subpoena authority will make the Postal Service more effective and efficient in its pursuit of justice. 
   The Deceptive Sweepstakes Mailings Elimination Act of 1999 takes a tough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other games of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use sweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a legitimate product, provide adequate disclosure, and abide with Postal Service regulations, then the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation. If deceptive practices are used in a sweepstakes or a game of chance solicitation, the Postal Service will be able to stop the solicitation and impose a significant penalty. 
   So we are going to take a tough approach, both through Senator COLLINS' bill which I have cosponsored, through my bill which she has cosponsored, along with others, and this tough approach that is absolutely essential if we are going to protect seniors and others from the kind of deceptive practices which cost them so much money by encouraging them, through these practices, to buy items that they really do not want in order to win prizes that truly are unlikely or impossible to win.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the need for additional anti-addiction medications is a matter of great concern to me and an issue that I have been deeply involved with for a number of years. We must come up with new medications which block the craving of heroin. This is why I am very pleased to join with Senator HATCH and Senator MOYNIHAN in introducing legislation that would establish the infrastructure to enable qualified physicians to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in their offices without an additional DEA registration if certain conditions are met. This will allow for a promising new drug, buprenorphine, to be used in the treatment of opiate addiction in physicians offices, under a separate registration from the Attorney General. Specific conditions would have to be met. These conditions include: Certification by participating physicians that they are licensed under state law and have the training and experience to treat heroin addicts; and that they have the capacity to refer patients to counseling and other ancillary services. 
   Mr. President, there are a number of reasons why this legislation is necessary. The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, requires separate DEA registrations for physicians who want to use approved narcotics in drug abuse treatment and separate approvals of registrants by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by state agencies. The result has been a treatment system consisting primarily of large methadone clinics located in big cities, and preventing physicians from treating patients in an office setting or in rural areas or small towns, thereby denying treatment to thousands in need of it. Additionally, experts say that many heroin addicts who want treatment are often deterred because of the stigma that is associated with such with such clinics. 
   The intent of our legislation is to exclude medications like buprenorphine from burdensome regulatory requirements of the Narcotic Treatment Act, in order to carry drug abuse treatment beyond the methadone clinics and into physicians' offices. In so doing, the legislation includes protections against abuse. These protections include the following: Physicians may not treat more than 20 patients in an office setting unless the HHS Secretary adjusts this number; the HHS Secretary, as appropriate, may add to these conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated; and the program will continue after three years only if the HHS Secretary and Attorney General determine that this new type of decentralized treatment should continue based on a number of determinations. 
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer, has helped to develop buprenorphine, which is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the near future. The Congress, NIDA and the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) have long recognized the urgent need to develop new medications for drug addiction treatment. This is evident in the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which established the Medications Development Division of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the enactment of legislation requiring HHS and IOM to cooperate in the development of anti-addiction medications. 
   Recent data show that five out of six opiate addicts are currently not in treatment. This has contributed to a continuing public health crisis of significant proportions--the age of first heroin use is dropping; the number of heroin users is increasing; and the number of people becoming dependent on heroin is increasing. According to NIDA, the incidence of first-time use of herion in the 12-17 year old group has increased fourfold from the 1980s to 1995. 
   These facts and sentiments were also expressed by experts in this field of critical importance to the Nation during a May 9, 1997 Drug Forum on Anti-addiction Research, which I convened along with Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator Bob KERREY. Forum participants, including distinguished experts such as Dr. Herbert Kleber and Dr. Donald Landry of Columbia University, Dr. Charles Schuster of Wayne State University and Dr. James Woods of the University of Michigan, made it crystal clear that time is of the essence--we must act expeditiously on new treatment discoveries. According to public health experts, the untreated population of opiate addicts (and other injection drug users) is the primary means for the spread of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis into the general population, not to mention the families of such addicted persons. Failure to block the craving for drugs along with failure to provide traditional treatment will most certainly continue the spiral of huge health care costs--costs that will largely be borne not by the addicts, not by insurance companies--but by the American taxpayer. 
   Buprenorphine, currently in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act, has a unique property--it has a ceiling effect, it is well tolerated by opiate addicted persons, and has a very low value for diversion on the street. Clinical trials conducted in 12 hospitals around the United States proved the new medication to be an extremely effective treatment medication. According to NIDA, of the 100,000 heroin addicts in France, between 40,000-50,000 addicts are being treated with buprenorphine without ill effects. Dr. Donald Wesson, Chairman of the American Society of Addiction Medicine {ASAM} Medication Development Committee wrote: ``The availability of buprenorphine in physicians' offices adds a needed level of care and is one avenue to expand current opioid treatment capacity. ASAM strongly supports federal legislation to enable buprenorphine to be prescribed in physicians' offices for treatment of opioid dependence ..... We are very pleased to see that the bill makes provisions for physician training and qualification.''

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join my colleagues from the Armed Services Committee, Senator MCCAIN and Senator  ROBB, in introducing this legislation authorizing the Department of Defense to close excess, unneeded military bases. 
   For the past two years, Secretary of Defense Cohen has asked the Congress to authorize two additional base closure rounds. But Congress has not acted. 
   Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have repeatedly said we need to close more military bases, and I am confident that they will once again ask us to close more bases when the President's budget is submitted next month. 
   The legislation we are introducing today is intended to start the debate, and I anticipate the administration will make a similar legislative proposal to the Congress. 
   This legislation calls for two additional base closure rounds, in 2001 and 2003, that would basically follow the same procedures that were used in 1991, 1993 and 1995, with two exceptions. 
   First, the whole process would start and finish two months later in 2001 than it did in previous rounds, to give the new President sufficient time to nominate commissioners. 
   Second, under our legislation privatization in place would not be permitted at closing installations unless the Base Closure Commission recommends it. 
   In a November 1998 report, the General Accounting Office listed five key elements of the base closure process that ``contributed to the success of prior rounds''. Our legislation retains all of those key elements. GAO also stated that they ``have not identified any long-term readiness problems that were related to domestic base realignments and closures, that ``DOD continues to retain excess capacity'' and that ``substantial savings are expected'' from base closures. 
   Mr. President, every expert and every study agrees on the basic facts--the Defense Department has more bases than its needs, and closing bases saves substantial money in the long run. 
   The report the Department of Defense provided to the Congress last April clearly demonstrated these facts. As the Congressional Budget Office stated in a letter to me last July, ``the report's basic message is consistent with CBO's own conclusions: past and future BRAC round will lead to significant savings for DoD.'' 
   Every year we delay another base closure round, we deny the Defense Department, and the taxpayers, about $1.5 billion in annual savings that we can never recoup. And every dollar we spend on bases we do not need is a dollar we cannot spend on things we do need. 
   Mr. President, I am not going to make any detailed judgments on the President's defense budget proposal until we see the details, but I am prepared to support an increase in defense spending if the money is spent wisely. 
   However, Congress should not use defense funding increases as an excuse to avoid tough choices. The addition of new resources cannot be a substitute for the billions of dollars of savings that would be generated by a new round of base closures. We cannot justify spending more for national defense unless we show our own willingness to make the best use of defense dollars by reducing unneeded defense infrastructure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable person from Saginaw, Michigan, Mrs. Bernice Barlow. Mrs. Barlow is leaving her position as president of the Saginaw branch of the NAACP after thirty years. 
   As president of the Saginaw NAACP, Bernice Barlow has been a powerful advocate for equality and civil rights. Although her tireless efforts on behalf of the NAACP are admirable in their own right, Mrs. Barlow has not confined her community service to the NAACP. She has also served with distinction in leadership roles with organizations like the Saginaw Education Association, the Tri-County Fair Housing Association and the Saginaw County Mental Health Board. 
   Despite her retirement from the presidency of the Saginaw NAACP, Bernice Barlow will continue her service to the people of Saginaw. Her husband, Charles, and her four children will surely be pleased to have more of her time, but I have no doubt that they will support her continuing efforts to ensure that equality and justice are recognized as the birthrights of every citizen. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that my colleagues will join me in congratulating Bernice Barlow as she steps down from her position as president of the Saginaw NAACP, and in thanking her for her longstanding commitment to the people of the city of Saginaw.

    Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding community leader in the City of Saginaw, Michigan, Dr. Nick Hall, Jr. Dr. Hall is being recognized at the 17th Annual ``O Give Thanks'' Banquet, hosted by The New Valley Mass Choir. 
   Dr. Hall has served as Pastor of Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church since 1952, and has earned a reputation as one of Saginaw's most respected religious leaders. Throughout his 46 years of service at Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church, Dr. Hall has consistently demonstrated a deep devotion to the spiritual well being of his congregation and of the people of Saginaw. 
   Dr. Hall's leadership has not been confined to his congregation. He served as a County Commissioner from 1992 to 1996, and has been a prominent member of civic organizations like Habitat for Humanity, the AIDS Committee of Saginaw, the Clergy Coalition Against Crack Cocaine, and the Saginaw Substance Abuse Advisory Board. Through his ministry and his community involvement, Dr. Hall has touched the lives of thousands of people. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Nick Hall, Jr., has demonstrated a laudable commitment to making Saginaw a better place to live for all of its residents. It is truly fitting that he is being recognized for his achievements at this year's ``O Give Thanks'' Banquet. I know my colleagues will join me in commending Dr. Hall for his leadership and his dedication to the people of Saginaw, Michigan.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator CLELAND, Senator ROBB, and a number of my colleagues today in introducing The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999. Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and the Joint Chiefs have told us that the single greatest challenge they face right now is recruiting and retaining the people we need to man our military services. This legislation will go a long way to ensuring that we continue to attract and retain the high quality people that make up our military services today. 
   Just last month, the men and women of our Armed Forces demonstrated once again that they are by far the best trained, best equipped, best disciplined and most highly skilled and motivated military force in the world. Operation Desert Fox was a large-scale military operation that was carried out flawlessly. It involved 40,000 troops from bases virtually around the world. Over 40 ships performed strike and support roles. Over 600 aircraft sorties were flown in 4 days, and 300 of these were night strike operations. 
   General Zinni, the commander in charge of Operation Desert Fox, pointed out that even in peacetime an exercise of this scale is very dangerous and stressful. To have achieved all of the objectives of Operation Desert Fox without a single United States or British casualty and without any degradation of our ongoing efforts in Bosnia, Korea, and other critical areas around the world was truly remarkable. 
   Mr. President, the key to the success of Operation Desert Fox--and the key to the strength and capability of our Armed Forces--is the men and women who serve in uniform. We must do everything we can to ensure that we continue to recruit, train and retain the best of America to serve in our Armed Forces. 
   Over the past year, there have been growing indications that the military services were beginning to have problems in both recruiting and retention, particularly retaining highly skilled mid-grade officers and enlisted whose skills are in demand in the private sector. To address these problems, last month Secretary Cohen and General Shelton announced a package of improvements in military pay and retirement benefits that will be part of President Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee on January 5 of this year, General Shelton and all of thee Joint Chiefs said that enactment of this package of pay and benefits was their highest priority. 
   Mr. President, the bill my colleagues and I are introducing today includes all three parts of the Defense Department's pay and retirement package, as well as some of the key recommendations from the recent report of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance. 
   First, it includes an across-the-board pay raise for all military members of 4.8 percent, effective January 1, 2000. This is slightly higher than the 4.4 percent recommended by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs, but it carries out their stated objective of increasing military pay in FY2000 by one-half a percentage point above the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). This 4.8 percent increase will be the largest increase in military pay since 1982. 
   In addition, our legislation calls for annual increases in military pay of one-half percent above the annual increase in the ECI in each year of the Future Years Defense Plan. Again, this reflects DOD's current plan, and is designed to bring military pay more in  line with private sector wages as measured by the ECI. 
   The second part of DOD's plan included in our legislation is a targeted pay raise that would be effective July 1, 2000. Taken in conjunction with the January 1 4.8-percent across-the-board pay increase, this targeted pay raise increases the pay of mid-grade officers and enlisted personnel, and also for key promotions points, between 4.8 and 10.3 percent. 
   The third part of the DOD plan included in this legislation is a revision to the Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986. This portion of the legislation would restore the 50-percent basic pay benefit for military members who retire at 20 years of service. 
   In addition to the package of pay and retirement benefits proposed by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs, the legislation we are introducing today includes several key recommendations from the recent report of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance specifically designed to help the military services recruiting and retention efforts. 
   The most important of these recommendations is a series of improvements to the Montgomery GI Bill. Education benefits are a very important attraction for young people entering the armed forces. Our legislation would increase the basic GI Bill benefit from $528 to $600 per month and eliminate the current requirement for entering service members to contribute $1,200 of their own money to participate in the program. Both of these changes were recommended by the Congressional Commission of Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance to increase the attractiveness of the GI Bill to potential new recruits. 
   The Commission also recommended, and our legislation includes, a provision to allow service members to transfer their earned GI bill benefits to one or more immediate family members. It is my view, Mr. President, that this will prove to be a very 
   powerful recruiting and retention incentive. 
   This legislation also includes a provision that would allow military members to participate in the current Thrift Savings Plan available to Federal civil servants. Under our proposal, which follows the recommendation of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, military members would be permitted to contribute up to 5 percent of their basic pay, and all or any part of any enlistment or reenlistment bonus, to the Thrift Savings Plan. 
   Finally, this legislation includes a very important provision that extends for 3 years--through December 31, 2002--the authority for the military services to pay a number of bonuses and special and incentive pays that are critical to recruiting and retaining highly skilled military members. Under current law, the authority to pay these bonuses and special pays runs out at the end of this year. Renewing this authority now through the end of 2002 will reassure military personnel managers--and military members themselves--that these crucial authorities will continue to be available to them. 
   Mr. President, detailed costing of this legislation will have to be done by the Congressional Budget Office over the next several weeks. In my view, however, the provisions contained in this legislation will not require us to increase the funding for national defense above the levels I understand will be proposed in President Clinton's FY2000-2006 Future Years Defense Plan. We should be able to accommodate any increase in funding necessary for these initiatives from lower priority programs. 
   I believe this package of pay and benefits is fair and will ensure that we continue to attract and retain high quality people to serve in our armed forces. All of us are committed to the well-being of our military members and their families. There may be some aspects of this legislation that require improvement or modification, and that can be done as the Armed Services Committee begins to review this bill and any other bills that are introduced to address the concerns we all have in this area. 
   In closing, I want to recognize the leadership of the author of this legislation, Senator MAX CLELAND. Fortunately for the Senate and for the men and women of our armed forces, he will continue to serve as the Ranking Democratic member of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee during the 106th Congress. Senator ROBB of our Committee has also played an important role in drafting this legislation. Both Senator CLELAND and Senator ROBB have a tremendous commitment to the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator CLELAND, Senator ROBB, and all of the cosponsors of this legislation and with all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in the months ahead to secure enactment of this important legislation.
