   Mr. GORTON. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee is correct. That reference is specifically intended to refer to the Swan Lake-Tyee Intertie project and was inadvertently referred to as the southeast Alaska intertie. I hope the RECORD  will reflect this clarification and will result in an expeditious use of the funds.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday morning, without any notice to this Senator, my distinguished colleague from Washington, Senator MURRAY, came to the floor to congratulate me in my career in the Senate in a most generous and gracious fashion and to yield time to other Senators for the same purpose. 
   Each of them, including the other Senator present, Mr. BURNS, was more than generous and profuse in their praise. The experience of listening to it in my office bore some resemblance to attending one's own wake. But, nonetheless, the many fine things that were stated about my career by Members on both sides of the aisle is deeply appreciated. 
   I reflected a little bit later on the fact that while our public image--and, for that matter, our public duties--has to deal with profound political and social questions of public policy, our personal relationships among the 100 Members is something really quite different. Each of us leaves the others with strong impressions. Friendships become both broad and deep during the course of a career here in the Senate. When one comes to the end of such a career, it is those personal relationships, in my view, that are the most deep and most profound and that have the greatest effect on one as an individual. 
   To listen to expressions from people who are not accustomed to speaking emotionally or personally is an extremely moving experience. For that reason, as close as each of those individuals was to me, I don't want to mention them by name but 
   simply express my thanks and my appreciation for all they said. Those friendships, of course, will continue in most cases through a lifetime. 
   Relationships of necessity are really quite different. 
   There is, however, one other set of relationships about which I should like to speak very briefly, and that is the relationship between a Member of this body and his or her staff, both present and past. I think I can say unequivocally that quite profoundly I am and have been a creature of my staff over the period of my entire 18 years in this body. 
   My proudest achievement is that so many young people--almost all from my own State--have worked for a great or shorter period of time on my staff either here or in the State of Washington. The great majority of them, of course, have already gone on to other careers--most of them in the State, a return that I find particularly gratifying. 
   If I have a legacy--I think in many respects if any of us has a true legacy over the years--the best of all the bills we have gotten passed and almost inevitably amended within a relatively short period of time--that legacy is the young people to whom we have given a start here in highly responsible positions, working on important matters of public policy and dealing with dozens, hundreds, and even thousands of the constituents whom we represent, growing in not only thoughtfulness but responsibility during that period of time. 
   For me, the great legacy for generations to come will be the new, young, and maturing people who have worked for me during the course of these 18 years. I have every hope that at some time in the not too distant future at least one of them may appear in this body as a Member. And certainly I am of the belief that many of them will appear in my State and other States in positions of increasing responsibility in a lifetime that will have been marked by our association together. 
   I thank my colleagues. I thank the staff here and of the Senate itself in this Chamber, 
   but most particularly the hundreds of young people who have worked for and with me during the course of the last 18 years.

   Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his fine comments and compliments. I may tell the Senator, that relationship is perhaps a result of the marvelous biblical statement about casting your bread upon water and having it come back manyfold. 
   When I was first a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was in the minority. The Senator from Nevada was the chairman of the modest subcommittee on the legislative branch, and I was his ranking minority member. The Senator from Nevada came to my office to consult with me in a way he did not need to about those appropriations. I think it was I who persuaded him to put more benches and trash receptacles on the Capitol grounds, which was denuded of them at the time, so I can believe I actually accomplished something in that modest position. 
   It was that lesson when we went into the majority that taught me that on the Appropriations Committee and the Senate as a whole, it was best to work with everyone when it was at all possible to do so and that you were far more likely to be successful not only for the people of your own State but the country, if you used the experience and the wisdom of all Members of your committees or of the Senate itself. 
   So I am particularly grateful for the comments of the Senator from Nevada. But whatever courtesies he was rendered by this Senator he earned by having taught the same lesson.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, one of my priorities in this bill was to make sure that Washington seniors continue to have access to their Medicare+Choice program and to expand choices for other seniors who have been dropped from the program due to low payment rates in Washington state. We need to make sure Medicare+Choice is a stable option in the Medicare program for our seniors. 
   I am concerned, however that the new requirements on the submission of adjusted community rate ACR proposals for 2001 may interfere with my goal of ensuring the stability of this program for seniors in my state. Under this bill, plans that have ensured seniors have consistent access to the Medicare+Choice program cannot use the increased funds to stabilize the benefits they already provide or to ensure adequate payments to providers such as doctors and hospitals--even if they are losing money on providing those benefits right now. 
   In Washington State we have plans that are operating at a deficit every year but they continue to stick with this program and offer health care to our seniors. They need this money simply to stabilize and maintain current benefits. Without these funds, there will be no basic programs for seniors at all. Plans cannot offer enhanced benefits or lower premiums if there is no program in existence, in Washington state, that is what we are facing--the possibility of no Medicare+Choice programs at all. 
   I don't disagree with the intent of the provision to ensure that seniors benefit from this new funding in the form of reduced premiums or increased benefits. My point is that there are more ways to help out seniors and one way is to ensure that their plan will not only be there this year, but the next year and into the future. One way to do that is to simply add a provision to the current language that allows plans to stabilize or enhance patients access to providers such as doctors and hospitals. 
   You can spend millions of dollars on the fixtures of a new house, on antique furniture, on expensive paintings, and the like but if there is no foundation the house will fall to the ground and no one will benefit. Our first priority should be to ensure that the Medicare+Choice program is stabilized that at a minimum seniors continue to have the choice we promised them.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Older Americans Act amendments of 2000. Seniors are a vital part of our community. The programs authorized by this Act help make sure low-income and frail seniors have every opportunity to stay independent, in their own homes, and remain a part of the community. Through meals on wheels and the congregate meal program thousands of seniors in Washington state whether homebound or not, receive nutritious meals and an opportunity to socialize with their peers. Through community service employment many low-income seniors who have poor job prospects have been meaningfully employed in a wide range of activities including education, health care, senior centers and nutrition services for older people. This reauthorization makes sure these needs will continue to be met. 
   In addition this bill funds activities to protect the rights of the vulnerable elderly through the long-term care ombudsman program which provides volunteer advocates for seniors living in nursing homes and other long-term facilities; through programs to prevent elder abuse, neglect and exploitation; and through assistance programs for insurance and other public benefits. 
   This year's authorization also includes an important new addition to the Older Americans Act--the National Family Caregiver Support program. Thousands of families are choosing to care for their senior parents and grandparents in their own homes. This can be a wonderful option for seniors who are no longer able to live independently but may not need or want the full time care of a nursing home, or for those seniors unable to afford assisted living arrangements. Counseling, training and respite care will be available to family caregivers. These services will also be made available to grandparents who are caregivers to children. 
   I deeply believe that seniors in this country should continue to have access to the quality services they have received in the past from the Older Americans Act. This reauthorization not only accomplishes that goal but includes needed improvements. My only regret is that I was unable to be here in person to vote in favor of its passage.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we live in a period of unprecedented prosperity and opportunity. 
   We can go more places than ever before. We are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. We are employed in jobs today that were unthinkable just a few years ago. 
   Our lives have changed dramatically because of computers, the Internet and technology. 
   But with all the good that comes with technology, there are elements that cause us concern. One such concern that has captured our attention is the issue of privacy. 
   As more of us use the Internet to shop and conduct business, more of our personal information is being spread throughout the web. That information, in many instances, is used properly and in a way that is good for consumers. But as in any field, there are those who abuse the public trust by using this personal information in unethical ways. 
   Because of concerns about consumer privacy, the Senate has considered how we might do better at protecting consumers while not unwittingly turning off the Internet engine that is such a key part of the economic prosperity we currently enjoy. 
   The Senate Commerce Committee recently held its third hearing this year on the privacy of information gathered from consumers who use the Internet. Since the Federal Trade Commission recommended legislation in this area earlier this session, I, and I believe a substantial number of my colleagues, have come to agree that we must act on this issue in the not-too-distant-future. 
   I have come to believe that Federal legislation is needed to protect consumers. I don't think that the current voluntary privacy policies are sufficient. Consumers who use the Internet should be given more information about what data is being gathered about them, and they should be given greater control over how this data is used. 
   I have also come to believe that Federal legislation is needed to protect and improve Internet commerce which, of course, benefits consumers and businesses alike. Not only will the assurance of adequate, enforceable privacy standards increase consumers' comfort with on-line transactions, but the possibility of States acting to protect consumers in the absence of a Federal law threatens to create a patchwork of conflicting privacy mandates that could be hard to apply to a medium that does not recognize State borders. 
   Though I know that I support Federal legislation regarding the on-line collection and use of consumer information, I confess to not knowing at this time exactly what should be legislated. At the last hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee we considered three different bills, and additional, and more varied, bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. I don't know which of these approaches or combination of approaches will best protect consumers without making on-  line transactions overly burdensome. On-line merchants, providers of both goods and 
   services, have touted the benefits to consumers of using the Internet to gather information that facilitates targeted marketing. This could very well be the case but I want to know that consumers are informed of and agree with these marketing practices. 
   Determining more specifically what consumers want from privacy legislation is something that I hope we can do in the next session of Congress. 
   While much, through certainly not all, of the discussion in Congress about privacy is focused on the issue of the on-line collection and use of consumer information, I think it is also important that Congress remain cognizant of the fact that ``privacy'' as it relates to the Internet is a far broader and more complex issue. For all of its salutary effects, the ease with which the Internet allows for the compilation and sharing of private information gathered in the physical world, information about financial transactions, medical histories, reading habits, eating habits, sleeping habits, information about almost every aspect of one's life raises legitimate concerns that Congress should and will continue to address. 
   The privacy of medical information, which can be intensely personal, is one such issue about which Congress must remain vigilant. Improved technology along with changes in health care delivery, billing systems, information gathering and genetic testing all increase the number of people who have access to health records. Americans should know that personally identifiable health information is private and they should have control over who has access to it. At the same time our challenge is to find a way to balance legitimate needs for health care information--for example, medical research--and individual privacy rights. 
   Future Congresses will adopt additional health care reforms. We clearly need to improve our Nation's health care system. Although most Americans are satisfied with their health care, most Americans are also concerned about those in our country who have inadequate health care and no hope of improving their situation. I support reforms that improve access to quality health care for those who have none, that keep intact our wonderful system of hospitals and clinics in all areas of our country and that provide people with meaningful choices. 
   When future Congresses address this area, one issue I will watch most carefully is the amount of health care information that is provided to the Government, and how this information is used. We must be careful not to adopt measures that give Government regulators the ability to peek into people's private medical records. A few years ago, my home State of Washington embarked on several health care reforms. Most of these reforms were in the wrong direction. Our legislature adopted reforms that put the government in charge of health care decisions for people and gave a government commission the ability to cancel private health insurance coverage in our state. 
   I found both of those moves bothersome, but our legislature didn't stop at just controlling health care decisions for our citizens. No, our legislature took one additional chilling step. It decided that if the government was providing health care, as well as dictating which private health plans could remain in business, the government should have access to personal, private medical records. 
   That is going way too far, and fortunately, the good people of Washington made sure that radical change was not placed into the law. 
   Over the next year, I am convinced that Congress will adopt meaningful health care reforms that help people, but as we do that, I must constantly advise my colleagues to follow the ``do no harm'' rules of medicine and not fall prey to those who believe that government-run health care, along with all that it brings, is the right solution to this challenge. 
   No matter the type of information in question--consumer or medical--Americans have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thoughtful legislative action is needed at the federal level to address the legitimate concerns many Americans currently have in this regard.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it has taken a considerable period of time to reach the happy conclusion of the debate over the appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture. None of that delay is due to the distinguished chairman or to his ranking member, the Senator from Wisconsin, who have worked with extraordinary diligence and I think immense success in bringing this bill before us. 
   I can't even begin the major portion of my remarks without thanking him for his thoughtfulness to the particular concerns of my own State--first, of course, the field of agricultural research. There is research money in this bill for wheat, apples, asparagus, animal diseases, small fruit, barley, and potatoes, to name a few. In each and every case, that money will help our farmers meet the demands of the market in the future--both here in the United States and overseas. 
   In addition, without precedent, there is a considerable and most indispensable relief for the tree fruit industry in my State and others--formerly a highly profitable occupation that has fallen on bad times. A bridge is provided in this bill until more successful times in the future. The cranberry industry falls into exactly the same situation. And, of course, with respect to low farm prices in many other commodities nationwide in scope, relief is included in this bill, again with the hope that we will soon have better times in the future for our agricultural products. 
   There are, however, two subject matter areas of this bill that are of particular importance. The first has to do with sanctions--the unilateral sanctions that the United States has imposed on itself barring the export of our agricultural commodities and for that matter medicines to a number of  countries around the world for some form of foreign policy reasons. 
   Those sanctions by and large are canceled by this bill, and the President is deprived of the power in the future to impose them unilaterally without dealing with us in Congress. This may be very important in the immediate future with the threat that sanctions will be taken against even our good friend Japan with our agricultural products by reason of its whaling practices. I disagree vehemently with its whaling practices. But I don't think we should deal with them by punishing our farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers. Personally, I would have preferred the more sweeping language of the original Senate bill in this respect. There was vehement opposition to some of its provisions in the House of Representatives. 
   My colleague from the State of Washington, Congressman NETHERCUTT, worked diligently, and often in opposition to his own party's leadership, in crafting this compromise. This compromise, I guess, I would describe as being 80 percent of what we need. It includes what I think are some unwise provisions related to travel to Cuba. But, in my view, we should take this three-quarters, or 80 percent, of what we need, and we should begin to restore the opportunity to secure these markets to our farmers. And we should take care of the rest of the controversy next year. 
   Will we immediately begin to see huge sales of our wheat, for example, to Iran and to other former major customers? I am not at all sure we will. It may take years to repair the damage we have created by these unilateral sanctions. But this is a start. This gives our farm community, at a time of very low prices, once again the ability to compete in the world markets, 
   and not just in some of those markets. 
   Finally, and most importantly, are the provisions of this bill dealing with the price of prescription drugs. My colleague from Nevada, who just concluded his remarks, had a number of points, with which I don't entirely agree, but I certainly do agree with him on that one. He was one of the cosponsors of the Jeffords-Dorgan proposal on the reimportation of drugs. 
   Simply stated, we face a situation in which American pharmaceutical manufacturers that are benefiting from huge tax subsidies through research and development tax cuts, and benefiting from the immense research that we do in the National Institutes of Health, nevertheless, sell their products outside of the United States in Canada, in Europe, and in Latin America for prices half or less the price they charge for those drugs in the United States. That is outrageous. It is a form of discrimination without any justification whatsoever. 
   Six months or so ago, I introduced a bill to directly ban price discrimination in prescription drugs in the same way it has been banned in almost every other commodity in the United States in interstate commerce for some 65 years.

   Mr. GORTON. Washington state's rural communities have also benefited by the National Rural Development Partnership, particularly those regions that have been forced from their natural resource-based economies. For the sake of those who have come to rely on the NRDP, I would sincerely hope the Secretary of Agriculture would take into consideration the few remaining resources available to these communities when allocating discretionary funds in the future.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as expected, Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL have once again crafted an excellent Agriculture Appropriations bill that benefits not only the State of Washington, but natural resource dependent communities and rural economies all across the nation. 
   For my own State of Washington, this equates to more than $5 million in essential research programs for wheat, apples, asparagus, animal diseases, small fruits, barley and potatoes to name a few. I have long advocated for increased emphasis on agriculture research, noting that projects such as these advance the development of new technology, generate healthy food systems, promote environmentally sound growing practices, and maintain the U.S. dominance in agriculture production. 
   Also included in the legislation are the indispensable relief funds necessary to ensure the longevity of the once highly profitable and prosperous tree fruit industry in Washington. The $138 million in direct payments to apple producers will provide necessary short-term relief favored by Washington's orchardists. 
   The cranberry industry, lesser known to most but still one of the hardest hit in the agriculture economy, will also benefit from $50 million in relief. 
   In response to the other natural disasters that have plagued our nation, $3.4 billion in emergency spending is included for farmers and rural areas that have already experienced continued low farm commodity prices. 
   While the core issues in the bill are of great significance, there are two other issues in the conference report I wish to highlight. Both the sanctions relief and drug re-importation provisions deserve the Senate's support. 
   With respect to sanctions relief, I believe few members of Congress would argue that food and medicine sanctions fail to cripple regimes or handicap the ability of dictators to simply find these goods elsewhere. What sanctions on food and medicine do promote are uncompensated losses to America's farmers and poor health in sanctioned countries. 
   For more than a year-and-a-half, many members of this body have fought to right this situation and remove these onerous barriers. Obviously our efforts to provide a comprehensive package of sanctions reform has been met with determined resistance. 
   With that said, however, the compromise my friend and colleague from Washington, Mr. Nethercutt, brokered to the best of his ability, without ever losing sight of the common goal of sanctions relief, and to the severe chagrin of several influential members, was agreed to by the Agriculture Appropriations conference committee, of which I was a member. 
   While some will argue that this compromise is not comprehensive enough and does not perfectly mirror the language of the original Senate bill, this language is unquestionably significant. What the language does include is sanctions relief for exports to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, North Korea, and Libya. If my colleagues believe this major shift in policy does not make a positive statement regarding Congress' intent to provide sanctions reform, I think they are sadly mistaken. 
   Perhaps even more pivotal, this language prohibits the Administration from imposing any new unilateral food or medicine sanctions without the consent of Congress. What with the Administration considering wheat sanctions on Japan for that country's whaling practices, I hope this change in policy will be supported by agriculture advocates. This is another significant goal the sanctions coalition has sought to attain. 
   I choose not to argue with my colleagues over the merits of the Cuba travel or financing restrictions contained in the bill, but instead choose to remind my colleagues that we have accomplished something great here. 
   While this compromise does not reflect everything we intended when we sought to achieve our goals, it does contain the core principles necessary in order to ensure unilateral sanctions reform. And I remind my colleagues that it is a compromise. 
   It's not perfect. It's a starting point, a means by which we test the system. If the changes we have incorporated into this bill aren't workable, then we will work to change them. 
   No one in this body believes agriculture trade will resurrect with each of these countries overnight. Will Iran announce a wheat tender in the next few months? Few years? We cannot tell. Sanctions reform will take work, and it will take time. But we must begin somewhere and we must begin now rather than later. 
   I fear some of my colleagues have lost sight of the ultimate goal, and I hope they and the Administration would not seek to undermine the language our agriculture community supports and desires. 
   As a representative for a Northern border state, I have been privy to issues surrounding drug prices. Everyday Americans pay 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent or more for prescription drugs than our neighbors in Canada, in Mexico and for that matter most of the rest of the world. Who does  this affect most? Those who take the most prescription drugs--typically seniors, and those without any kind of prescription drug coverage from their insurance. But all Americans pay more whether through higher prices at the drugstore counter or higher insurance premiums. 
   Why does this problem exist? American pharmaceutical companies sell the exact same prescription drugs overseas, drugs developed and manufactured here in the U.S., for a fraction of the price they demand from American citizens. Other countries have implemented price control policies that successfully tempt manufacturers to discriminate against American consumers with higher drug prices. Our drug companies agree because the costs of manufacturing are nominal, and they can make some profit overseas by simply charging Americans all of the high costs of research and development. 
   This bill takes a first step towards solving this problem. It allows wholesalers and pharmacists to go to Canada and other countries where prescription drugs are sold at deep discounts and bring the same FDA-approved, FDA-manufactured products back to the U.S. in order to pass the discounts on to American consumers. 
   It is important to note that safety is a priority in this bill. Only products that have been determined to be safe and effective can be brought into the United Sates. The importer is required to test for authenticity and degradation. And importers can only bring in these products from countries that the Secretary of HHS has determined have an appropriate regulatory infrastructure to ensure the safety of prescription drugs. 
   This provision should give our American families access to lower cost prescription drugs that are safe and effective. 
   Is it perfect? Probably not. But, I hope it will work and I hope it results in lower prices for consumers in the U.S. and eventually puts pressure on drug companies to end price discrimination in the U.S. Critics say the bill has loopholes and drug companies will find a way around it. Let me be clear--if they do I will be back to make sure this provision is even stronger. I hope that is not necessary, that drug companies will simply end the current discrimination against Americans by charging fair prices here in the United States. 
   This is not my favorite idea for dealing with price discrimination. It is a much more complicated solution than I would prefer. 
   My idea is straightforward and based on a law that has applied to every product sale in the U.S. since 1935--the Robinson-Patman Act. This law simply says that manufacturers can't use price to discriminate among buyers. If that principle is applied to prescription drug sales overseas--drug companies would no longer be allowed to discriminate against their best customers--American families. 
   But this bill is something that can be done this year to lower prices for American consumers. I believe it represents a genuine step forward to lower prescription drug costs for all Americans. 
   With all that said, the bill before the Senate not only represents a response to the core needs of agriculture, but signifies a profound shift in sanctions reform, and puts the drug companies on notice. While I have indicated that neither proposal represents perfection, what each does signify is the goal of Congress to address issues vital to those we represent. I sincerely hope my colleagues will work to pass this bill without hesitation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass H.R. 3986, a bill introduced by Representative Doc Hastings, R-Washington, that will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to study the feasibility of moving the intake system for the Kennewick Irrigation District from the Yakima River to the Columbia River. I introduced a similar bill earlier this year, S. 2163, which was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this month. The Senate's action today sends this bill, critical to Central Washington's efforts to recover threatened and endangered salmon, to the President's desk--an achievement long sought by the Yakama Indian Nation and the irrigators of the Yakima River Basin. 
   Disputes over how to allocate and use water have always been contentious in the Pacific Northwest, and the disputes have only become more difficult as the region has been forced to deal with the recovery of threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead species. Over the past year, however, I have been pleased to support a new era of cooperation among tribes and various irrigation districts in Eastern Washington. An area of consensus has developed around the concept of ``pump exchanges,'' which move the intake systems of irrigation districts from over appropriated streams and rivers to rivers downstream with more water. In July, I introduced legislation that authorizes the study of a pump exchange for the Okanogan Irrigation District and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. I hope this legislation will receive quick approval during the 107th Congress. 
   H.R. 3986 will amend the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Program, YRBWEP, first approved by Congress in 1994 (P.L. 103-434). That legislation established a comprehensive framework for increasing critical flows in the Yakima River in order to reverse a longstanding trend of declining salmon and steelhead runs. One portion of that legislation, Section 1208, authorized a specific project to electrify hydraulic turbines at the Chandler Pumping Plant near Prosser, Washington. By converting these pumps from hydraulic to electrical power, an additional 400 second feet of water would be added to a 12-mile stretch of the Yakima River below Prosser Dam called Chandler Reach. This project would increase survival rates and provide important new habitat for both the anadramous and resident fisheries in this critical section of the Yakima River. This electrification project is still a good approach to augmenting Yakima River flows, but early in its implementation an even better idea was developed that can nearly double the benefits projected from electrification. 
   The pump exchange approach proposed in H.R. 3986 could result in completely eliminating the need to divert water at Prosser Dam and Wanawish Dam for use by the Kennewick Irrigation District, K.I.D., and the Columbia River Irrigation District, C.I.D. This plan will require building a new pumping plant on the Columbia River and a pipeline to connect this new facility to K.I.D. This approach could add back to the Yakima River during critical flow periods the entire 749 second feet of water now diverted at Prosser Dam. This project might well be the key to the success of the rest of the YRBWEP program. For the extensive efforts being made farther upstream to be entirely successful, the lower sections of the Yakima River must provide the conditions necessary for salmon and steelhead to survive their journey to and from the upper river and its tributaries. The Chandler Reach and the lower Yakima must have sufficient water at the right time for anadromous fish to be able to transit this area. Without it, the programs upstream will be less effective. 
   The legislation passed today authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to spend some of the funds previously authorized for the electrification project to develop this new approach. There are several studies and undertakings necessary to determine with certainty the efficacy and cost of this pump exchange project. These include carrying out a feasibility study, including an estimate of project benefits, an environmental impact analysis, and preparing a feasibility level design and cost estimates as well as securing critical right-of-way areas. 
   This change in approach to enhancing flows in the lower Yakima is enthusiastically supported by the resource agencies of the State of Washington, including the Washington State Department of Ecology, as well as by the Northwest Power Planning Council, the Bonneville Power Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   It is important to note that a change in the diversion for K.I.D. from the Yakima River to the Columbia River will completely change the current operational philosophy of the district. It will evolve from a relatively simple system relying on gravity to supply its customers to one of significant additional complexity involving a major pump station and pressure pipeline to the main feeder canals. This remodeling of K.I.D. will have significant impact on the existing system and its users during construction, startup, and transition. That is why it is essential for K.I.D. to be in a position to develop these facilities in a way that best fits their current and future operational goals and causes the least impact to the district water users. This legislation requires the Bureau of Reclamation to give K.I.D. substantial control over the planning and design work in this study with the Bureau, of course, having final approval. It is an approach that will continue local improvement and support, which is vital to the success of this project and other projects. 
   I thank Representative Doc Hastings for his leadership on this bill in the House of Representatives and appreciate the support of my colleagues in passing this bill that will provide a crucial component to the salmon recovery efforts in the Yakima Basin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before I make some general remarks, I will respond to the three--and I think there have only been three--critics of this bill. 
   For the better part of 3 days, the Senate has indulged in the remarks of the Senator from Illinois over one item out of many hundreds in this bill. Normally speaking, items such as the Lincoln Library are included in bills such as this because the Senators from the States concerned believe they are important and because we believe they are reasonable national priorities. 
   I think I can assure the Senator from Illinois and the body that, had I known we were going to go through this process, there would have been no money for this project in this bill at all. It may very well be there will be no more tomorrow. 
   I do think a library for Abraham Lincoln's papers in Springfield, IL, is an appropriate project. The State of Illinois and various local entities and individuals are providing the great majority of the money that is going into that project. The Senator from Illinois has engaged in a filibuster, required the vote of 89-8 on cloture, all over the bidding practices with respect to the way in which that project is undertaken, as to whether or not they ought to be Federal bidding practices or the State of Illinois' bidding practices--bidding practices of the State of Illinois that I believe he had something to do with creating while he was a member of the legislature of that body. 
   Even under the bill as it appears here, the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to review the design, method of acquisition, and the estimated cost, and can deal with anything that the Secretary believes to be untoward in this entire question. But I have to say that to spend 3 days of the time of the Senate on this internal dispute involving Members of Congress and others from the State of Illinois was an imposition on the time of the Senate at any time, but especially when the Senate is attempting to finish many important bills of which this is one, but only one. We will go forward with it at this point. We will pass the bill at this point. I believe the President of the United States will sign it at this point. But I can certainly not remember any other instance in which a Member from a State that is getting a benefit from the bill has looked so carefully at the teeth of a gift horse. 
   The second question I raise is about some of the criticisms from my good friend, the Senator from Arizona. He complains about money in this bill for carriage barn rehabilitation at the Longfellow National Historic Site. That is a national park site. That is the very kind of thing that we must rehabilitate. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, when he lived at his place, had a carriage barn. I don't know whether the Senator from Arizona feels we should let it fall down, but my own view is our first duty is to maintain the national park sites that we have at the present time. The Senator from Wyoming has just referred to that. How that constitutes pork, or a reason to vote against this bill, is, I must say, beyond my understanding. 
   He complains about dollars for the southeast Alaska disaster fund that he claims were not included in either the House or the Senate bill. In fact, they were included in the Senate bill under a different account number. 
   He complains about $30 million for site-specific earmarks or emergency funds, one quarter of which turn out to be--slightly more than one quarter--for hazardous fuels reduction activities carried on by Northern Arizona University. 
   When I was on the floor, he was complaining about the rehabilitation of a fish hatchery in White Sulfur Springs, WV, which was requested by my good friend and colleague, the Senator from West Virginia. Again, I am puzzled why it is we should not provide such office rehabilitation at a site that is a specific function of the people of the United States. 
   In other words, I don't find those criticisms to have any particular merit whatsoever. This is our business. It is the business of this bill to see to it  that the lands and historic 
   sites and facilities of the United States of America are properly maintained. I think one of the great shortcomings, one of the overwhelming shortcomings that we have had in the last few years is that we have not been maintaining these sites to the extent they ought to be maintained. One of the goals, which I have accomplished in this bill, is to increase the amount of money for that maintenance, both in the regular bill and in this supplement to this bill that is the third item of controversy here today. 
   This bill is criticized by the Senator from Louisiana as not including the full authorization for the so-called CARA bill, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. She is certainly correct; it does not. That bill is an almost $3-billion-a-year entitlement for some 15 years, the net result of which is that the items included in it are deemed to be more important, should that bill pass the Congress of the United States, than saving the Social Security system, than education, than health care, or any of the other items for which we appropriate every year. In my view, it is utterly inappropriate as an entitlement that automatically comes off the top, before all the other priorities of the people of the United States. 
   On the other hand, many of the items preferred in that CARA legislation are highly worthy items, items for which this subcommittee chairman is delighted to have what now amounts to a greater authorization. Many of them will be more liberally funded in the future as a result of the proposals that are a part of this bill now. 
   It is said--it was said in that criticism--that this bill sends all the money through the Federal bureaucracy rather than CARA sending it directly to the States. First, it doesn't send all the money through the Federal bureaucracy. Many of these programs are existing programs that result in formula grants to the States, and others are competitive grants to the States. At this point, the Congress can, through its authorizing committees, change the distribution formula for any one of these programs, either to make them more direct or more focused. CARA, of course, doesn't send all its money directly to the States, either. It does include large amounts for payment to coastal States but they are for new programs which are not even authorized at this point and will not be unless some bill of that nature is passed. 
   Second, this is criticized by some conservatives for not providing protections for private property. The Interior bill funds currently authorized programs. It doesn't authorize them; it funds currently authorized programs and therefore, by definition, includes every protection for private property that exists in any one of those authorizing laws. If there are shortcomings in this field, it is not the fault of the Appropriations Committee but of the very authorizing committee that presented CARA to us in the first place. 
   For Federal land acquisitions that are funded by this CARA-lite, in future years everyone is going to be subject to the same process as is used at the present time. They are all going to go through appropriations committees. I can assure my colleagues, I cannot think of a case where this committee has approved a project that did not have the support of the relevant Members of Congress, except maybe for this one in Illinois, which has been the subject of debate for some 3 days. So that objection is simply not valid. 
   It is also pointed out this bill does not provide States 
   and local governments with a predictable funding stream. You bet your life it does not, and it was not so designed. Why should we give a predictable funding stream for grant programs to State and local governments in precedence to the very programs for which we are directly responsible? We do not have a fully predictable or legally enforceable funding stream for schools. We don't have it for most of our health care programs. We don't have it for research and development programs. We don't have it for a wide variety of the programs that are subject to debate every year. It is just for that reason that we do not have it. They should be subject to debate and revision with respect to priorities every year. That is why we have a Congress. 
   On the other hand, this new title does provide a decidedly increased likelihood that these grant programs will be sustained and will increase in future years. 
   What this bill does is to say that if you do not spend this money on the programs outlined in this bill, you cannot spend it on something else, but it will go to reducing the national debt. It is only a couple months. Members on both sides of the aisle vociferously were saying that a reduction of the national debt was the most important single economic activity in which we could engage. Chairman Greenspan was quoted constantly on the floor of the Senate. We forgot that when some decided we needed these ``predictable funding streams,'' that is to say, entitlements which come directly out of debt reduction. 
   I have never been able to see the logic of a 15-year guaranteed funding stream that could not easily be adjusted if the programs were ineffective or if we went into economic times in which there were higher priorities. 
   Those are some of the critiques of the particular proposal, additional portions of which are likely to be included in the appropriations bill for Commerce-State-Justice, particularly the oceans portions of it which will be debated later. 
   Finally, Senator GRAHAM from Florida criticized the bill for not providing adequate funds for national parks. While CARA would have guaranteed an extra $100 million per year for the National Park Service--Mr. President, I am allowed to take time from Senator STEVENS.

   Mr. GORTON. The answer is, of course, CARA did not either. CARA gave money to the National Park Service above the line but 
   not below the line, and very likely future Congresses will simply reduce the discretionary portion of that account by the amount guaranteed in CARA itself. 
   It was at my insistence that this CARA-lite does include an item, I believe $150 million a year, for national park maintenance. I think that is one of the most important elements of the bill itself. 
   The vote on cloture indicated the broad support for this bill, as did the overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives. For that overwhelming bipartisan support, I owe particular thanks to Senator BYRD for helping me in developing the conference agreement and shaping it in a way that merits the support of Members on both sides of the aisle. His new staff minority clerk, Peter Kiefhaber, has been a tremendous asset during the course of his first year. He has been ably assisted by Carole Geagley of the minority staff and Scott Dalzell, who has been with us on detail from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   I thank my own exemplary staff: Bruce Evans, who is sitting here with me, Ginny James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Christine Drager, and Joe Norrell, as well as our detailee, Sheila Sweeney, and Kari Vander Stoep of my personal staff. All have also worked so many hours on this bill that I do not dare count them for fear of feeling ashamed. They have worked extremely hard, but they have been successful and have every reason to be gratified with their work. 
   I note for the record this is the last year in which I will be privileged to work with my counterpart chairman, Congressman RALPH REGULA from the House of Representatives. He will have another subcommittee next year, and I tell you, I will miss him. I have never dealt with anyone in this body or in the other body with whom I have had a more positive and affirmative, constructive working relationship, often with a great many laughs because of his marvelous sense of humor. RALPH REGULA will have left a substantial legacy of increased priority for the maintenance of our Federal lands and facilities and a great approach in a matter of principle. 
   In summary, this is a popular bill that has every right to be popular because it meets with many of the needs of deferred maintenance for past neglect. It has many projects in it that are of great importance to Members on both sides of the partisan divide in this body and our significant national priorities as well, and will get us through another year with respect not just to these natural resources used in energy  research and cultural institutions in the United States but in a way I think worthy and which I recommend heartily to my colleagues.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the conference report on the Interior and Related Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The conference report passed the House yesterday on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 348-69. 
   The bill provides $18.94 billion in total budget authority, an amount significantly above both the FY 2000 level of $15 billion and the President's FY 2001 request of $16.5 billion. This increase is primarily attributable to two items that I know to be of great interest to my colleagues. 
   The bulk of the increase over the budget request level is a direct result of the disastrous wildfires that plagued the West this summer. This bill includes the administration's $1.6 billion supplementary fire package, as well as $200 million in additional funds to address rehabilitation needs on the national forests, maintenance and upgrades to firefighting facilities, and for community and landowner assistance. The bill also includes the $240 million provided in the Domenici floor amendment for hazardous fuels reduction in the wildland/urban interface. 
   Those areas which public lands abut upon communities, towns and cities, as well as language designed to expedite this work that so desperately needs to be done. This language does not, however, overturn or bypass the National Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, or any other environmental statute. In total, the bill provides $2.9 billion for fire management. 
   The other element of this legislation that has garnered the most attention is title VIII, the land conservation, preservation, and infrastructure improvement title. This title does two things: First, it provides an additional $686 million in fiscal year 2001 for a wide variety of conservation programs, including Federal land acquisition, the stateside grant program, forest legacy, and urban park recreation and recovery. These amounts are in addition to the amounts agreed to in conference in the base portion of the bill. In total, funding for these Interior programs is about $1.2 billion for next year. 
   Second, title VIII establishes a new conservation spending category in the Budget Act for an array of conservation programs, for the maintenance of Federal land management facilities, most particularly, national parks, and for payments in lieu of taxes. Using the $1.2 billion provided in the fiscal year 2001 Interior bill as a base amount, plus a notional $400 million for coastal programs that may or may not be provided in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, this new spending category is established using a base of $1.6 billion. 
   For Interior and CJS programs combined, this new budgetary category will go by $160 billion per year through fiscal year 2006. This separate allocation may only be spent on qualifying programs, and any amounts not spent will roll over and be added to the following year's allocation. 
   Title VIII also establishes several subcategories within 
   the broader category conservation category. The allocation provided for each subcategory will only be available for programs within that subcategory and may not be used for other programs. And, like the structure of the broader category, any amounts not appropriated within a subcategory in a given year would be rolled over and added to the following year's suballocation. 
   The suballocations and associated amounts are shown on the chart. The bottom line is ``payments in lieu of taxes'' for $50 million a year--over and above the present payment in lieu of taxes. The next amount is ``Federal  maintenance,'' an amount added specifically at my request. This was originally suggested by House conferees. It glaringly omitted the deferred maintenance in our national parks and our forests and our wildlife refuges, an amount that I think approaches $16 billion, and a modest start on that over and above the present bill is included in each one of these years. 
   Next, the orange is ``urban and historic preservation programs,'' the purple is ``State and other conservation programs,'' wildlife grants, wetlands conservation, the Geological Survey, and the like. The red is ``Federal and State Land and Water Conservation Fund programs.'' The green is ``coastal programs,'' basically under the jurisdiction of NOAA, and the ``other'' beginning in fiscal year 2002 is the $160 million a year add-on which can be at the discretion of the Congress, devoted to any one of these other programs. That will be decided by future Congresses. 
   As the allocation for the overall category grows in the outyears, that growth is not tied to any particular subcategory. The suballocations are not caps. There is nothing to prevent the Appropriations Committee from also using its regular allocation to fund any one of these programs that provide additional funding from the overall program growth, the blue part, lines I have just described on the graph. 
   While this structure is somewhat confusing at first, its effect is to provide some certainty to several programs within the Interior subcommittee jurisdiction which will be likely to receive and maintain substantial increases over the current funding levels. At the same time, it preserves the availability of Congress to adjust specific amounts on a year-to-year basis in response to changing needs performance and other factors. 
   Finally, of course, any money not spent, while it cannot be spent for any other spending category, obviously will go to pay down the national debt. 
   The programs that comprise the new spending category are a mix of programs identified as priorities by the administration in its budget request, by supporters of CARA during their deliberations, and by Congress as a whole as represented in the thousands of individual requests that I receive each year as chairman of this subcommittee. I want to emphasize, once again, what I did several months ago when we debated this bill for the first time. I think this year we had 1,100 requests from 100 Senators for programs within Interior--the great majority of which would fall into one of these categories. 
   Vitally important is the fact that the bill does not create any new entitlements. At the same time, it is not an empty promise. For the same reasons-- we rarely see an appropriations bill go to the floor without spending every penny of its allocation--I think it likely that allocations provided in title VIII will be fully subscribed in each year's 
   appropriations bill. The exact mix of funding will be up to future Congresses, but title VIII does prevent these funds from being taken from the target programs and used for other programs, even other programs within the Interior bills, such as Indian education, health services, Forest Service, the cleanup of abandoned mine lands. 
   To be perfectly clear, the construct of title VIII is not what I would have dealt had I complete discretion. Nor do I believe it is what the Appropriations Committee would have written with complete discretion. Congress has always had the ability to provide increases to the programs through the regular appropriations process, but it has not necessarily done so due to the resulting impact on other programs and, of course, on the deficit or the surplus. Nevertheless, title VIII represents a fair compromise that reflects the general views of this Congress with respect to these programs, and it has the support of the administration. 
   Now, the focus in recent weeks has been on wildfires and the conservation funding issues I have just addressed. There are other features of the bill to which I want to draw my colleagues' attention. The conference report provides an increase of $104 million for the operation of the National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police, including $40 million to increase the base-operating budgets of nearly 100 parks and related sites. The bill also provides an increase of $66 million for the management of Bureau of Land Management land and resources, a badly needed boost for an agency that has sometimes received less attention than the other land management agencies, but which has a demanding mission in terms of multiple uses. 
   The operating budgets of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service also receive healthy increases, which I hope will enable these agencies to improve performance in areas such as the Endangered Species Act consultation and recreation management. 
   In terms of programs designed primarily to benefit American Indians, this bill has a great deal to offer. From the very beginning of this process, I have made Indian education in school construction one of my highest funding priorities. Many colleagues on the committee--particularly my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, who is here on the floor--have for years stressed the need for increased investment in Indian schools. This year's budget request provided an opportunity to provide this investment. I am pleased the conference report provides $142 million for school replacement. This is $75 million above this year's enacted level and will provide funds for the replacement of the next six schools on the Bureau of Indian Affairs priority list. It also provides funding for a cost-share program for eligible replacement schools, which is designed to provide funding so that construction of replacement schools can be fully completed in order to remove the school immediately from the BIA priority list. Indian school repairs also increases by $80.5 million above last year's level. 
   The conference report also provides significant increases for health services for Indian people, including an increase of $167 million for health services and $47 million for construction and repair of health care facilities. 
   The bill provides continued support for the Department of Interior's efforts to reform its trust management practices. This is a massive problem that has developed over decades, if not the entire 20th century, which will take time and resources to fix. This conference report provides the budget request for the Office of the Special Trustee, and also provides an emergency supplemental of $27.6 million for activities directly related to recent developments in the Cobell litigation. In addition, the bill provides an increase of $31.9 million above fiscal year 2000 for trust reform within the regular Bureau of Indian Affairs appropriations. 
   Of the many cultural programs within this subcommittee's jurisdiction, the National Endowment for the Arts was again the focus of much discussion in the House-Senate conference. The conference agreement maintains the Senate funding level for the NEA--an increase of $7.4 million above the current year level. These additional funds will be targeted for arts education and outreach programs, and I think are a fitting response to the reforms that the NEA has instituted in recent years. This is the first increase of any significance for the NEA in more than a decade. I am also pleased that funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities is also increased by $5 million. 
   For energy programs, this conference report includes funding for several programs that will help reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources, as well as reduce harmful emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The energy conservation account is increased by $95 million, including full funding for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles--PNGV. This amount also includes increases of $18 million for the Weatherization program and $4 million for the State Energy Conservation Program. For fossil energy R&D, the bill provides $433 million, and establishes a new powerplant improvement program to support demonstration of advanced coal power technologies. This is an initiative that I am sure Senator BYRD will wish to discuss further, because it is one of his favorite items. 
   There are many other elements of this conference report that recommend its passage by the Senate, but I will only mention one more. Funding for payments in lieu of taxes is increased by $65 million, including $50 million provided in title VIII, outlined on this chart. This brings appropriations for  PILT to $200 million. This increase represents a significant step in raising appropriations for PILT toward the authorized funding level. 
   I also wish to note two errors in the Statement of Managers. Page 177 of the Statement of Managers indicates that an increase of $4 million above the House level is provided for ``Heavy Vehicle Propulsion within the hybrid systems activity.'' This is incorrect, and is a result of an error in the conference notes. The $4 million increase over the House level is for ``Advanced Power Electronics,'' reflecting the amount provided in the Senate-passed bill. On page 194 of the Statement of Managers, the paragraph that begins ``Consistent with paragraph (3) and accompanying Senate instruction .....'' should have been deleted. 
   In closing, I want to again urge my colleagues to support this conference report. It does a tremendous amount of good for the management of our Federal lands, as well as for the conservation of lands and waters whether Federal, state, municipal or private. It is a good bill that has the unanimous support of the conferees of both Houses, and I urge its adoption by the Senate.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico not only states the case correctly but understates his own participation.

   Mr. GORTON. That is correct. 
   I want to thank the Senator for his compliments and to say what is obvious--that his dedication and commitment to his constituents in this connection is both praiseworthy and effective. 
   Earlier in the course of this debate, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, was here to speak to the same subject. He and the Senator from North Dakota made a very good team. Together they persuaded the President to include this very significant amount of money, both for the construction of new Indian schools and for the repair of those that can appropriately be repaired or remodeled. But as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, this is the first major contribution to that. I can say that as long as I am in this position and as long as the Senator from North Dakota is in his, I know we will keep this in the forefront of our consideration. And I tell him that we are going to try to get to the bottom of that priority list as well as to the top of the priority list. 
   The Senator from North Dakota has done a good job in a good cause, and this bill takes a major step forward in meeting those priorities.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor of the Senate today to tell you about the hard working teachers, faculty and parents of the Wellpinit School District and their efforts to improve their children's education by bringing technology to the classroom. For their dedication, I am delighted to present the Wellpinit School District with one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards. 
   The Wellpinit School District is located on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington and educates 440 students of which 95 percent are of Native American descent. The K-12 school has already far exceeded any other rural school in Washington state with its efforts to boost the use of technology in the classroom. Under the direction of Wellpinit's Board of Directors and Superintendent Reid Reidlinger, Wellpinit implemented an innovative program that includes increasing student access to computers and improving students' use of the internet and intranet. 
   Wellpinit reconfigured its curriculum, integrating it with a computer program that allows students from both elementary and secondary grades to access an individualized instructional program for any core subject. The computerized curriculum has been highly effective in increasing national test scores. In fact, Wellpinit was named the highest achieving Indian Reservation school based on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Wellpinit has also been selected as one of America's Top 100 Wired Schools by the editors of Family PC Magazine. 
   Earlier this year, I awarded Quillayute Valley School District one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards for developing the Washington Virtual Classroom Consortium (WVCC), which links rural schools together via the Internet in order to pool resources and expand learning opportunities for students and staff. Wellpinit has joined the WVCC to further enhance the educational opportunities for all students. 
   Superintendent Reid Reidlinger told me, ``Wellpinit has been a model for other schools. Federal grants have helped with bringing technology to our district, and as a result, we have very advanced students.'' 
   I commend all those who have contributed to Wellpinit's technology plan and ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the hard work and commitment of the students, teachers and faculty at the Wellpinit School District.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am glad that the U.S. Senate is finally passing the Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act. This bi-partisan legislation, which I introduced with Senator MURRAY, will ensure that transportation workers who toil away on our nation's waterways receive the same tax treatment afforded their peers who work on the nation's highways, railroads, or navigate the skies. 
   Truck drivers, railroad personnel, and airline personnel are currently covered by the Interstate Commerce Act, which exempts their income from double taxation. Water carriers, who work on tugboats or ships, were not included in the original legislation. This treatment is patently unfair. The Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act will rectify this situation by extending the same tax treatment to personnel who work on the navigable waters of more than one state. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will have no impact on the federal treasury. This measure simply allows those who work our navigable waterways protection from double taxation. 
   This matter came to my attention through a series of constituent letters from Columbia River tug boat operators who are currently facing taxation from Oregon as well as Washington state. I am committed to securing this relief for my constituents, as well as hard working tug boat operators across the nation, before the end of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, and my distinguished colleague, Senator MURRAY, and I believe others on both sides of the partisan divide, came to the floor to speak about the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. That bill was passed by the Senate unanimously. It resulted from a broad, bipartisan coalition that worked over a period of more than 1 year here in the Senate. It was sparked by my colleague and myself as a result of a terrible tragedy--an explosion in a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, WA, that snuffed out the lives of three wonderful young men, destroyed a magnificent park, and left physical damage that will be years in repair. 
   No individual involved in this debate got every single element in that bill that he or she wished. Liquid and natural gas pipelines are vitally important to the Nation and the transportation of fuels. 
   Some thought renewal of the act would be somewhat weaker than the present statutes. Others, myself included, wanted considerable strengthening, particularly with respect to local input into the way in which such pipelines are managed in communities near homes, schools, parks, and the like. 
   The net result, however, is a pipeline safety renewal that is a considerable and significant improvement over the present act. There will be more notice. There will be more severe penalties. There will be greater opportunities for local comment and local participation. 
   But in spite of all of this work, in spite of the passage of this bill, little is happening in the House of Representatives. 
   The Bellingham Herald, the daily newspaper in the community subjected to this tragedy, pointed out just a little bit more than a week ago that the passage of the Senate bill means nothing if it is not passed by the House. 
   Almost immediately, however, after the passage of the Senate bill, a number of Members of the House of Representatives began to place roadblocks in the way of the passage of the Senate bill, claiming it wasn't strong enough and it didn't do this, or it didn't do that, or it didn't do something else. 
   The House of Representatives has had exactly the same opportunity to deal with this issue as the Senate. 
   After a brief hearing a month or so after the accident took place, literally nothing at all took place in the House of Representatives. Many of us here were led to believe that if the Senate bill were passed in its ultimate form, it would be taken up and easily passed in the House of Representatives--until these last-minute critics began to point out what they consider to be the facts. 
   Talk is cheap. But talk doesn't create safer pipelines in the United States. Those who oppose this bill have proposed nothing with the remotest chance of passage by the House of Representatives, much less the Senate of the United States. 
   We have only a short time left. Those who criticize the bill as being too weak would do far better to pass the reforms that we have and attempt to build on them later than to destroy a bill which, if it does not pass within the next few weeks, will have to begin its process all over again next year, with highly questionable prospects. 
   Believing that accomplishment is better than demagoguery and that a bill beats oratory any day, I come here to join with both Republican and Democratic colleagues to plead with the Members of the House of Representatives to take up the Senate bill, to debate it to the extent the House wishes to do so, and to pass it so we can get it signed by the President and enacted--which, incidentally, I am confident would take place if the House were to pass the bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a subject in a happy vein. 
   Yesterday, the President sent a letter to the Speaker and to our majority leader on the subject of prescription drugs. In that letter he said:  
   I urge you to send me the Senate legislation to let wholesalers and pharmacists bring affordable prescription drugs to the neighborhoods where our seniors live.  
   That proposal was passed by the Senate a couple of months ago as an amendment to the appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture. It was sponsored by my colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, and by Senator DORGAN of North Dakota on the other side of the aisle, others, and myself. It is one of two or three ways that I have determined to be appropriate to reduce the cost of prescription drugs--not just to some Americans, not just to seniors, not just to low-income seniors, but to all Americans--by ending, or at least arresting, the outrageous discrimination that is being practiced by American pharmaceutical manufacturing concerns that are benefiting from American research and development aspects, benefiting from the research paid for by the people of the United States through the National Institutes of Health, but still discriminating against American purchasers by charging them far more--sometimes more than twice as much--for prescription drugs than they do for the identical prescription drugs in Canada, in the United Kingdom, in Germany, New Mexico, and elsewhere around the world. 
   The proposal by Senator JEFFORDS and others to which the President referred at least allows our pharmacies and drugstores to purchase these drugs in Canada or elsewhere when they can find identical prescription drugs at lower prices than the American manufacturers will sell them for to these American pharmacists, and to reimport them into the United States and pass those savings on to our American citizens. 
   I don't often find myself in agreement with President Clinton, but I do in this case. I believe he is entirely right to urge the Speaker and the majority leader to include this proposal in the appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture or, for that matter, any other bill going through the Senate and the House of Representatives, so that we can take this major step forward to slow down, at least, this unjustified discrimination in the cost of prescription drugs to all Americans. 
   In this case, I join with the President in asking both the Speaker and our majority leader to use their best efforts, as I believe they are doing, to see to it that this overdue relief is in fact offered.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Supreme Court, with eight of nine Justices concurring, has just agreed with Microsoft that the notorious prosecution of Microsoft by the Department of Justice should go through the normal process of appeal and should be determined and should be examined by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals before any possible or potential appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   This was a correct decision for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the complexity of the case and the length of the record which, under almost any set of circumstances, would go through the normal appeals process. 
   The district court judge who decided the case and who has determined, I think entirely erroneously, that Microsoft must be broken up, wished to skip the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, stating that this matter was of such importance that it should go directly to the Supreme Court. The real motivation of the lower court, I suspect, however, was the fact that one of the vital elements of the district court's decision is directly contradictory to a decision of just about 2 years  ago by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals--the integration of a browser/Microsoft operating system, a major step forward in technology and convenience for all of the purchasers of that system. 
   It is easy to understand why the district court judge didn't want to go back to a higher court that he had directly defied, but that is no justifiable reason for skipping a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, I am delighted to say, agrees with that proposition. 
   This matter is now on its normal way through the appeals process, a process that I am confident will justify, in whole or in major part, the Microsoft Corporation, but only at great expense and at a great expenditure of time. 
   Once again, I call on this administration or on its successor to see the error of its ways in bringing this lawsuit in the first place. It has been damaging to innovation in the most rapidly changing technology in our society, one that has changed all of our lives more profoundly, I suspect, than any other in the course of our lifetimes. It is immensely damaging to our international competitiveness, encouraging, as it does, similar lawsuits by countries around the world that would love to slow down Microsoft's competitive innovation so they could catch up. 
   This is a field about which 10 or 15 years ago we despaired. Today, we are clearly the world leaders. For our own Government to be hobbling our own competitiveness is particularly perverse. It opens up the proposition that innovations in software will have to be approved by Justice Department lawyers before they can be offered to consumers in a way that seems to me to be perverse. 
   It doesn't take a great deal of courage to say that I trust Microsoft software developers in their own field more than I do Justice Department lawyers. At best, this was a private lawsuit, effectively brought on behalf of Microsoft competitors but being paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, where it should have, had it gone to court at all, been just that--a private lawsuit in which the Federal Government had little or no interest. 
   So, good news from the Supreme Court but news that can be greatly improved by a new administration's fresh look and the dismissal of its case in its entirety.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Washington state Congressional delegation introduced bills in the House and in the Senate to honor a fallen hero, William Kenzo Nakamura, by designating the Seattle federal courthouse in his honor. This brave soldier fought in Italy during World War II, and he died valiantly protecting his battalion. The day he died, Mr. Nakamura had already risked his life and saved his combat team by disarming an enemy machine gun stronghold. Mr. Nakamura should have received the Medal of Honor for this act of bravery, but he did not. 
   Even as this man's family was held in an internment camp in Idaho, he volunteered for duty in the United States military, and he headed to Italy to serve his country. After his heroic and selfless deeds, Mr. Nakamura was posthumously eligible for the Medal of Honor, but in World War II the Army did not award Japanese-Americans the Medal of Honor. I was pleased that earlier this year that twenty-two veterans, in similar circumstances to and including Mr. Nakamura, received Medals of Honor for their brave service in World War II. These men and their families waited too long for proper recognition and appreciation, and these honors are well deserved. 
   Though military heroes are often given medals for their service, the people of Washington state would like to extend a special tribute to Mr. Nakamura by naming the federal courthouse in Seattle in his honor. This action has not only the support of the entire Washington congressional delegation, but of local communities, veteran and military retiree organizations, and by Medal of Honor recipients in the Senate, my friends DANIEL INOUYE and BOB KERREY. To this outpouring, I add my support and commitment to seeing this designation passed through the Senate and acted into law.

    Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I regret I was unable to vote on the final passage of the Water Resources Development Act, S. 2796. Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of this legislation. 
   The bill contains authorizations for several important projects for Washington State. I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Senator BOB SMITH, and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH, for their assistance in addressing the water resource needs of the Pacific Northwest. I'd like to highlight four projects critical to my constituents. 
   The bill provides authorization for the Puget Sound Ecosystem Restoration Project, an environmental restoration program designed to improve habitat for four threatened anadromous fish species in the Puget Sound basin. The Corps of Engineers, contingent on available appropriations, will be authorized to spend $20 million in cooperation with local governments, tribes, and restoration groups to make existing Corps projects more salmon-friendly and enhance critical stream habitat. 
   WRDA 2000 also includes an authorization for the Corps of Engineers to study and construct an erosion control project for the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe. The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe, located on a 335-acre reservation in southwest Washington, has experienced dramatic erosion events for the past several winters. During the 1998-1999 winter storms alone, the tribe lost several hundred feet of shoreline. These events have been particularly damaging to this small tribe of 245 people, most of whom depend on the tribe's shellfish resource along the 700 acres of tidelands. 
   Another provision will assist the communities along the Columbia, Cowlitz, and Toutle rivers. During the early 1980s after the eruption on Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, the Corps of Engineers engaged in a series of emergency and congressionally authorized projects to stop or control the flow of sediment from Mount St. Helens into the Toutle, Cowlitz, and Columbia rivers. Since the major Northwest Washington flood of 1996, which severely impacted the communities surrounding these three rivers, the Corps of Engineers and county governments in Southwest Washington have engaged in discussions over the level of flood protection to be maintained for the Mount St. Helens Sediment Control Project. The WRDA bill clarifies the Corps' responsibility to maintain this project and provides certainty for the communities in the future. 
   Finally, the bill includes authorization for the Corps to accept funding from non-federal public entities to improve and enhance the regulatory activities of the Corps of Engineers. Since the listing of the four Puget Sound salmon species last year, the Seattle office of the Corps of Engineers has been inundated with permits that requires additional consultation order the Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, this additional responsibility requires additional staff and resources to occur in a timely manner. At the beginning of this year, the Seattle regulatory office had a backlog of 300 permit applications. Today that backlog has grown to nearly 1,000. This provision will provide the Corps the additional resources it needs to comply with the Endangered Species Act. 
   Once again, I would like to thank the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee for their assistance in providing authorization for projects important to the residents of Washington state. I am pleased the Senate passed this legislation today.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the past eight years, the responsibility to extend annual trade status to the People's Republic of China, PRC, has been shouldered entirely by the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though the United States Senate has eluded the duty of debating and deciding upon this significant issue, not one year has gone by when the subject matter hasn't weighed heavily on my mind. 
   If one year ago you had questioned any number of business or trade entities in Washington state my position on the prospect of extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, to China, I can almost guarantee you would have received a non-committal response. For years I have questioned China's commitment to free trade with the United States, and have been critical of the notion that the U.S. continue a relationship of ``engagement'' with the PRC. Couple these concerns with allegations of espionage, nuclear non-proliferation, questionable campaign contributions and influence, human rights abuses, persecution of religious freedom, and the treatment of the one true Chinese democracy, Taiwan, and one might challenge the notion that China receive such significant trading status from the United States. Mr. President, these issues have played a significant role in my criticism of our relationship with China, and therefore maintained an elevated status as I reviewed the prospect of voting on PNTR. 
   When I made my final decision regarding China's trade status, the mere simplicity of the issue suggested a rationale and consideration based solely on trade ramifications and WTO accession procedures alone. China's accession to the World Trade Organization is forthcoming, it's a fact, it's a reality, and it will happen. If the United States does not grant PNTR to China, the PRC will gain its ambitiously sought seat in the WTO, and the United States will lose all the benefits of trade with the more than 1.2 billion inhabitants of China. If Congress does not pass PNTR, the U.S-China trade deal that was 14 years in the making will be considered null and void, and every other member of the World Trade Organization will have access to the world's third largest economy. The potential loss of trade to the United States, and to the State of Washington, is too significant to ignore. 
   If the simplicity of the PRC's accession to the WTO was not enough to force me to reconsider my stance on trade with China, the details of the bilateral U.S.-China trade agreement helped secure my final decision to support PNTR. While I have long been critical of the Clinton-Gore Administration's policy with respect to China, the agreement brokered and finalized by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is uncomparable. 
   By granting PNTR to China, the U.S. stands to benefit from a wide array of trade issues. While the United States retains our valuable trading leverage in the bilateral agreement and will gain access to a once heavily guarded market, China is forced to amend its market strategy and alter its trading exercises in favor of practices that embrace free market principles. When and if China alters its trading practices, it's clear the U.S. has everything to gain. 
   When formulating my decision to support PNTR, it was necessary that I review and concur with those terms stated in the bilateral agreement. If the terms were ever called into question by U.S. industry, manufacturers, agriculture, the service sector, or the high tech industry, I would seriously reconsider my position.  
   However, not one of the aforementioned industries in the State of Washington outlined an objection to trade with China. According to the World Bank, China will have to expand infrastructure by $750 billion in the next 10 years. Washington companies like Boeing, Paacar, and Mircosoft are prepared to fill their needs. Service sector companies like Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, and Nordstrom will step up to fill consumer demands. Not to mention, agriculture can finally attempt to penetrate the Chinese market that has for so long eluded our commodities. From the lush orchards of Central Washington to the rolling wheat fields of the Palouse, agriculture in Washington state is prepared and stands ready to benefit from the access to the 1.2 billion consumers in China. 
   While it was fascinating to me that so many varying industries and retail companies support 
   PNTR and trade with China, the mere numbers and degree of tariff reduction contained in the bilateral agreement persuaded me most. 
   For example, the U.S. agriculture products that once faced enormous trade barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions, will receive a reduction of tariffs on average from 31.5 percent to 14.5 percent. Access for bulk commodities will be expanded, and for the first time ever China will permit agriculture trade between private parties. 
   What does this mean for Washington state agriculture? For the first time in over 20 years, China has finally agreed to lift the ominous and ridiculous phytosanitary trade barrier Washington wheat growers have learned to hate--TCK smut. As a result of this trade agreement, Chinese officials traveled to Washington state this spring and secured a tender for 50,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest wheat. While this purchase is nominal, and represents a figure that I will press to increase, the elimination of export subsidies on wheat has already enhanced the expansion of markets wheat growers desire. 
   For some of our most precious and high value commodities such as apples and pears, tariffs will be reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent. Frozen hash browns, the pride of the Columbia Basin, will receive tariff reductions from 25 percent to 13 percent. Tariffs on cheese will plummet by 38 percent; grapes by 27 percent; cherries and peaches by 20 percent; potato chips by 10 percent; and beef by 33 percent. All of these commodities represent a significant portion of the Washington state agriculture industry, and at a time when new markets are difficult to come by, news of China's tariff reduction promises resulted in waves of support for PNTR by farmers. 
   Washington state agriculture is not the only sector to gain access to China's market. As a matter of fact in 1998, direct exports from Washington to China totaled $3.6 billion, more than double the exports in 1996. Of that figure, 91 percent represented transportation equipment, namely aircraft and aircraft parts. 
   The Boeing Company maintains 67 percent of China's market for commercial aircraft. Boeing anticipates that over the next 20 years, nearly one million jobs will be related to Boeing sales to China. Over the next 10 years, China is expected to purchase 700 airplanes worth $45 billion. Recognizing Boeing's significant contribution to the Puget Sound region and the State of Washington, it's no wonder one of the major labor unions that builds these airplanes supports PNTR. 
   So many people automatically equate transportation jobs directly with Boeing, but the aerospace and commercial airline industry is also supported by thousands of additional employees that contract and subcontract with the nation's only airline supplier. These contractors in Washington and all across the nation also stand to benefit from trade with China. 
   While the agriculture and manufacturing industries in Washington stand to gain, the high-tech, service sector and forest product industries also will benefit from liberalized market access. China has agreed to zero tariffs on computers and equipment, telecommunications equipment, and information technology. Tariffs on wood will decrease 7 percent, and paper by 17 percent. In addition, fish products tariffs will drop by 10 percent. 
   Washington's geographic proximity to China automatically benefits the service sector, the ports, and transportation infrastructure. Banking, securities, insurance, travel, tourism, and professional services such as accounting, engineering, and medical needs will all gain access to China's market. Knowing the ambitious and adventurous nature of many Washingtonians in these fields, I can imagine many State of Washington subsidiaries could find a home in China. 
   While all these tariff reductions and trade liberalization efforts look good on paper, there are also several mechanisms built into the bilateral agreement to address trade and import concerns. Two of the most significant items negotiated by the United States were the import surge mechanism and the anti-dumping provisions. Both these provisions were considered ``deal breakers'' by American negotiators. Had they not been included, the U.S. would have walked away from the negotiating table. 
   The import surge mechanism will remain in place for 12 years following China's accession to the WTO, and can be used in response to potential import disruptions by China. The anti-dumping provision will remain for 15 years and will be used by the U.S. should an influx of Chinese products flood our market. 
   The efficacy of the anti-dumping mechanism is evidenced by the case the U.S. apple industry filed and won against China. Citing an excessive increase of apple juice concentrate, the U.S. industry filed an anti-dumping case with the International Trade Commission, ITC, just last year. After the U.S. Department of Commerce and the ITC agreed that the U.S. industry had been harmed, the price for juice apples in the U.S. increased from $10 per ton back to the normal $130 per ton. This case was significant as it exemplified the United States' ability to appropriately deal with Chinese dumping practices, and it concluded that the U.S. has an appropriate and workable mechanism to address the issue of import surges. 
   While the aforementioned specifics about the bilateral trade agreement speak volumes to our trade dependent friends at home in Washington, when all is said and done, when all the tariffs are reduced and markets are liberalized, major questions will still remain. Will China become the trading partner that the U.S. hopes and desires? Will the PRC adhere to those details so cautiously and ambitiously sought? Will the U.S. market benefit from the buying power of China's 1.2 billion consumers? While I might not remain as optimistic about trade with China as some of my counterparts or those in the U.S. trade industry, one fact will remain constant. With the passage of PNTR and China's eventual accession to the World Trade Organization, leaders in Beijing will have to begin complying by international trade rules and restrictions or face the wrath of its new trading partners. These partners will include the United States and all of our allies. 
   Of the other questions that still remain regarding human rights, religious freedom, non-proliferation, allegations of espionage, and the treatment of Taiwan, one can only hope that the eventual promises and attractiveness of democracy and free market principles will be embraced by those who encounter it for the first time. One hopes that eventually, Falun Gong practitioners will be able to practice their faith in public. One hopes that eventually the weight of internationalism, globalization and trade will move Beijing away from theories and military practices that could bring harm to their trading partners. One hopes that eventually workers will perform in a less oppressive regime. One hopes that China will one day accept Taiwan as an independent nation. One hopes. 
   Because I have remained vigilant about my criticism of China, I endure to continue my close watch over United States interests and national security. Because I unconditionally support Taiwan and that country's efforts to embrace freedom and democracy, I will forevermore remain their champion. While I believe that democracy will eventually reign true, I will continue to raise concerns regarding human rights, religious freedom, and the United States relationship with China on all fronts.  
   I will vote for PNTR not because I am comfortable with the thought that China will adhere to all the details in the bilateral agreement, or the prospect that they will become exceptional trading partners overnight, but I support the men and women from the most trade dependent state in the nation who have urged its successful passage. 
   Whatever the course of our relationship with China takes over the coming years, I assure Washingtonians that I will be scrutinizing the reactions of Beijing very closely. I will continue to engage in a dialogue with all interested parties to ensure that Washington benefits from these new trade practices. I will work to ensure that American interests and national security weigh heavy on the minds of our negotiators and the next Administration. Because this vote is unmistakably one of the most significant trade votes the Senate has cast in recent years, I assure my constituents that I will keep their interests at heart. 
   Whatever it takes.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate a remarkable young woman who hails from the great state of Washington and just recently struck gold at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
   On Monday, Megan Quann, a junior at Emerald Ridge High School in Puyallup, won the gold medal in the 100-meter breaststroke. Megan rallied from third place to win in a time of 1:07.05, setting a new American record. 
   Practicing every morning at 4:30 a.m. and swimming over 11 miles a day in preparation for the Olympics, Megan is a truly dedicated and inspiring athlete. I have learned that the City of Puyallup is already in the planning stages of welcoming their Olympic champion home with keys to the city and a plan to set aside a day on the calendar as ``Megan Quann Day.'' 
   Later this week, Megan will compete again as part of the women's medley relay and will have another shot at bringing home the gold. I wish Megan luck in her next race and ask that the Senate join me in congratulating her for what she has achieved.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I join Senator MCCAIN today as an original cosponsor of the Motor Vehicle Equipment Defect Notification Improvement Act. This measure, aimed at increasing consumer protections, is a great first step in addressing current statutory shortfalls. 
   The controversy surrounding the ongoing Ford/Firestone recall brought to light several deficiencies regarding the processes that are in place currently. A combination of increasing penalties, upgrading standards, and requiring more stringent disclosure should afford consumers the protections they deserve. 
   Let me assure my colleagues that this is a work in progress. I look forward to receiving input from all interested parties as I work with Senator MCCAIN to ensure that we learn from our mistakes and move forward to strengthen the safeguards that protect public safety.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate voted on several amendments to the bill establishing permanent normal trade relations status for the People's Republic of China. While I was unfortunately unable to cast my votes regarding these amendments, I was able to comment on a few of them. Today I wish to comment on the remaining amendments. 
   Two of the amendments argued were introduced by our colleague from North Carolina. I supported the first amendment offered by Senator HELMS, regarding family planning, abortion, and sterilization practices in China. Although the amendment failed by ten votes, I am pleased the Senate made a strong statement regarding these abhorrent practices. 
   While I agreed with Senator HELMS on his first amendment, I did not agree with him on his second measure. American industries have set the standard for appropriate business practice, and even though I agree with Senator HELMS that they ought to utilize these practices in China, I do not believe another layer of bureaucracy is necessary to accomplish this mission. 
   I would also have voted against Senator FEINGOLD'S amendment regarding the Congressional-Executive Commission established in H.R. 4444. I believe the parameters with which the Commission was established in the House of Representatives are adequate, and that additional requests or requirements from its members are not imperative. 
   Finally, the Senate considered an amendment offered by Senator WELLSTONE. Without question, the issues surrounding political prisoners and detainees who have attempted to organize should be addressed by the People's Republic of China. However, I believe the administration already has the tools necessary to address these very concerns. I would not have voted for Senator WELLSTONE's amendment.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize General Robert S. Frix, an outstanding individual from my State, who is the recipient of the Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. 
   This award is bestowed upon a select group of Eagle Scouts who are chosen by a national review board as distinguished individuals who, by sharing their talents and time with others, have improved their communities. General Frix clearly deserves this rare honor for his service to our country, his profession and community.  
   Our country owes a great debt of gratitude to General Frix for his decorated military service and accomplishments. A West Point graduate, he served our country for 34 years, earning the rank of Major General and numerous decorations including two Distinguished Service Medals, 26 Air Medals, and two Meritorious Service Medals. 
   Through two tours each in Vietnam and Germany, he distinguished himself as a leader, but his duty in the Middle East is most notable. As Chief of Staff and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Forces Central Command during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he was instrumental in rescuing Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's siege. Commanding the Joint Task Force Kuwait, he led the enforcement of U.N. Resolution 688. 
   Following his military service, General Frix turned to a different kind of battle, that of decommissioning, cleaning-up, and restoring U.S. Department of Energy former nuclear weapons fabrication and materials production sites. Formerly at the Rocky Flats, Colorado site and currently at the Hanford site in my state of Washington, he manages personnel and multimillion dollar budgets in order to accomplish the clean-up and disposal of highly radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials. At the helm of the DynCorp company, he and his employees have achieved an outstanding environmental safety record. 
   All the while, General Frix uses his talents for the benefit of others and remains committed to serving his community as the national president of the Army Aviation Association of America Scholarship Foundation and as a lifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans. In addition, he has used his military management skills to retire council debts and raise almost $10 million in endowment as a member of the Blue Mountain Council Executive Board and Senior Vice President of Finance. 
   General Frix willingness to help his community extends into his professional career in which he and his colleagues at DynCorp have worked side by side to construct park facilities and renovate a local cancer treatment facility. He is highly regarded by business associates as a community leader who sets an example for others to follow.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the real estate investment trust, or REIT, turned 40 years old yesterday. It has been a remarkable four decades for this investment vehicle. The goal of Congress in creating REITs back in 1960 was to give the small investor an opportunity to invest in portfolios of large-scale, commercial properties. Today, anyone and everyone can buy shares of real estate operating companies that focus on particular sectors or regions of the country. 
   In January, the REIT Modernization Act will take effect. Adopted by Congress last year, this law will permit REITs to remain competitive in the real estate marketplace by creating subsidiaries to offer the same range of tenant services provided by its competitors. And, as the REIT marks its 40th anniversary, so too does its association, NAREIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. NAREIT's annual convention will be held here in Washington, DC next month, and we wish them well on another successful event.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Senate voted on several amendments to the bill establishing permanent normal trade relations status for the People's Republic of China. Regrettably, I was unable to register my votes on these amendments. Following are my thoughts regarding a few. 
   With respect to the amendment offered by Senator BYRD regarding potential import surges from China, I must state my opposition. While the Senator from West Virginia deserves credit in his effort to protect the American worker, the anti-dumping and surge protection mechanisms contained in the bilateral agreement brokered between the U.S. and China were crafted to address this very issue. Recognizing these two issues were considered ``deal breakers'' by U.S. trade interests, I have every reason to believe his concerns have been addressed. 
   I must also state my opposition to Senator BOB SMITH's amendment regarding the harvesting and transplanting of human organs. Without question, the issue of human rights and the treatment of Chinese citizens should be of upmost concern to every American. I believe the human rights provisions agreed to in H.R. 4444 were established to conquer and address such atrocities. 
   In particular, I would have also supported the effort to table the amendment offered by Senator THOMPSON. I have for quite some time, to the knowledge of my constituency in Washington and my colleagues here in the Senate, criticized the Clinton-Gore administration's approach to non-proliferation issues with China. However, I do not believe that Congress, by creating an entirely new sanctions policy or by establishing an additional layer of export controls, can effectively address these concerns nor strengthen U.S. national security. We must approach these measures with caution, we will approach them with a new administration, and we must recognize that when we confront China about these terribly significant issues, we will be approaching them as a trading ``partner''. If in the coming years China does not appropriately address the issues of non-proliferation, I assure my colleagues that I will be the first to raise concern.

   Mr. GORTON. Impelled by an explosion last year in Bellingham, WA, that took three young lives and shook that community to its core, and given force by another recent tragedy in New Mexico, the Senate today is adopting the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. The bill brings much-needed reforms to the regulation and oversight of the pipelines that wind invisibly beneath our homes, parks, and schools, most notably by providing more information to local governments and to the public about the location and condition of pipelines and pipeline accidents; by requiring more accountability from the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety and by authorizing more funding for that Office and for States willing to assume additional oversight responsibility; by requiring operators to assess the risks to their lines and develop plans to address threats to their integrity; by giving willing States a clearer and larger role in the oversight of interstate pipelines; by directing additional attention and resources to research and development programs to improve pipeline integrity; by increasing civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety standards;  and by requiring Federal attention to recommendations for improvements to pipeline safety by state citizen advisory committees. 
   The issue of citizens advisory committees has, to my surprise, been one of the most contentious. The idea of creating an independent oversight body that is not controlled by industry, and that can objectively assess the state of pipeline safety and make recommendations for improvements to Federal and State regulators, is to me perfectly sensible. The passion with which industry has opposed even a pilot program for Federal citizen advisory committees has, I confess, disturbed me and strengthened my determination to see that citizen advisory committees are established and adequately funded. 
   While it has become clear to me that a Federal advisory committee will not be part of any legislation that can be enacted this year--and I am absolutely determined to see that legislation is enacted--I am committed to seeing that Washington State receives adequate funding for its own Citizens Committee on Pipeline Safety, whose members were recently appointed, but which I understand has been allocated only enough funds to pay for a meeting room four times a year, hardly the resources needed to meet the responsibility this committee has been assigned. 
   I will work through the appropriations process this year to see that not only is funding increased for all Federal and State pipeline safety activities, but that in addition to the $800,000 I am trying to direct for Washington State's new responsibilities in overseeing pipeline safety, Washington obtains sufficient funding to staff and pay for the activities of the Citizens Committee on Pipeline Safety. 
   The issue of citizen advisory committees has not been the only contentious issue in this bill. Getting here has not been easy, and were it not for the efforts and dogged perseverance of Members of both sides of the aisle, most notably Senator MCCAIN, and my colleague from Washington, Senator MURRAY, we would not be here today. I am deeply grateful for their work. 
   Another person who has made this happen, and for whom I have developed a true respect, is Mark Asmundson, the Mayor of Bellingham, WA. Following the explosion on June 10, 1999, and 
   with a commitment born, I believe, of justifiable anger, Mark has devoted himself to improving pipeline safety at the local, State, and Federal levels. It is people like Mark, who is committed to public welfare, passionate, practical, and resolutely good humored, and the many others who responded to the tragedy in Bellingham by taking action not only to improve their own safety, but the safety of people throughout this country, who constantly remind me how privileged I am to represent the people of Washington State. 
   Since the Commerce Committee passed S. 2438 in June of this year, following a factfinding hearing in Bellingham in March, I have been working to secure passage of this bill by unanimous consent as an extended debate this late in the year is impossible. The manager's amendment that was adopted today resolves concerns raised by some of my colleagues in a way that I think is fair, and, unlike some of the amendments offered and defeated in committee in a way that does not undermine the benefits of this bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Unlike inspections conducted on overland sections of pipeline, the inspector would need specialized knowledge to properly determine the structural integrity and soundness of, say, a cable suspension bridge, in addition to that of the pipeline. This would probably include an understanding of and training in: steel fabrication, structural engineering fundamentals, pipeline behavior under operating pressure, the characteristics of all cable types used in suspension bridges, and the characteristics of reinforced concrete foundation structures.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, after a refreshing though strenuous August recess, we are now in the home stretch not only of this session of Congress but of this Congress. 
   The previous speaker discussed one of the great national and international priorities, normal trade relations with China on a permanent basis. I have several other priorities, both national and regional, that I will discuss, each of which I think is vitally important for the successful conclusion of this Congress of the United States. 
   At the very top of my list is pipeline safety. More than a year ago, a tragic accident in Bellingham, WA, occurred with a liquid pipeline. A huge explosion snuffed out the lives of three bright young people and destroyed a magnificent and beautiful park. Ever since the date of that accident, my colleague from the State of Washington and I have focused a great deal of attention on the renewal and the strengthening of the Pipeline Safety Act and of the Office of Pipeline Safety, designed to enforce its restrictions. 
   We have succeeded in passing a relatively strong Pipeline Act reauthorization through the Senate Commerce Committee with certain objections, with a number of amendments that were seriously contested and closely divided in that committee. We have now worked diligently with all concerned and I believe we are on the verge of a bill that can come before this Senate and can be passed enthusiastically, and I believe unanimously, by the Senate of the United States. It is imperative that we do so quite promptly because while the House has begun to focus attention on the issue, time is very short before the end of this Congress to actually accomplish the goals we seek in increasing pipeline safety. 
   A dramatic and equally tragic incident during the course of the last month with a national gas pipeline in New Mexico has illustrated most regrettably, once again, the essential nature of our improving pipeline safety standards all across the United States. I am focused particularly on giving a more significant voice in pipeline safety matters to the people who live in the vicinity of these pipelines and whose lives regrettably seem to be very much at risk with respect to either negligence or oversight on the part of those who own and operate these pipelines. 
   Pipelines, both for natural gas and for the transmission of liquid petroleum products, are a vitally important part of our economy. In some respects, they are safer than other forms of transportation for these commodities. However, accidents are all too frequent, and all too frequently those accidents are devastating and fatal in nature. 
   The importance of passing this legislation cannot be overemphasized. I am highly optimistic on this subject. I had an extensive discussion last evening with the majority leader and have his encouragement. I believe in the course of the next few days we will be able to take up this bill. 
   Regrettably, on another high national priority, I find myself frustrated that we have not made a sufficient degree of progress. A number of days, over a period of weeks and months, have been devoted in this body to a debate on education policy and a renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. For all practical purposes, that bill is being frustrated by extended discussion, led by the unalterable opposition to providing more trust and confidence in our local school authorities on the part of the Democratic leadership and the senior Senator from Massachusetts. 
   An integral part of the bill, which is still before this body and which has majority support, is Straight A's. Straight A's gives State school authorities several options: One, to continue under the present system. Two, for a dozen or so States to combine a dozen or more present categorical aid programs into one system that comes to the State, is passed through with at least 95 percent of the money to individual school districts on one undertaking and one undertaking only, and that undertaking is that each State that would get this authority will sign a contract pursuant to which there will be an improvement in the skills of the students over a 5-year period; that is to say, by any objective measure that the State uses, our kids will be better educated.  
   It is a dramatic change. It is a change from process accountability, the form of accountability we have at the present time--that is to say: Did you fill out the forms correctly?--to results accountability: Are our children better educated? I am convinced and a majority of this body is convinced that by providing more trust and confidence in parents and teachers and principals and school board members--the people who know our children's names--that the students' education will improve. There is still time to pass such a bill. I regret the opposition even to a test, optional to each State, is so great it seems unlikely that this vitally important education reform will be passed. 
   Just last week I spoke to the junior and senior classes at Bridgeport High School, a rural school in Washington State, a very small school, not more than 100 students and faculty combined. They do not need more Federal rules and regulations. They don't need to be told they should use the newest Federal program to hire roughly half a teacher, which is what they get under that program. They need our trust and confidence in the dedicated nature of those teachers and administrators and parents in that community, who know better than we do here in Washington, DC, what the students of Bridgeport, WA, need. The same thing is true of 17,000 other school districts across the United States. 
   I also note present on the floor today my distinguished friend and colleague from North Dakota. He and I are joined in at least two other priorities with which we are dealing this year. One is the opportunity to end unilateral boycotts against the export of food and medicines from the United States. We represent, I am convinced, a substantial majority of the Members of the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives. We have a termination to those boycotts in the Agriculture appropriations bill that is now before our conference committee. I know he joins with me in believing that it is absolutely essential, and long overdue, that we end those agricultural boycotts at the present time and provide additional markets to American farmers and agricultural producers as at least one 
   modest step toward returning prosperity to the agricultural sector of our economy. 
   We are also joined in believing that Americans are overcharged for prescription drugs, that we have a system under which American pharmaceutical companies--who benefit from very large subsidies, both indirectly from the National Institutes of Health, and directly through tax credits for the development of prescription drugs--that when those companies charge Americans twice as much or more than twice as much for those drugs as they charge, for all practical purposes, almost anyone outside the United States, that something is absolutely wrong. Again, we have passed in this body at least a significant step in the direction of correcting that injustice. I think it is very important that the appropriations bill to which that important matter is attached be passed and we make at least a significant step, a genuine step forward toward fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of all Americans in the cost of the prescription drugs that are so important to their health. 
   On two other subjects, this body has passed a bill attempting to ensure the reliability of our electrical transmission system and the supply of electricity to all the people of the United States. We have had unwarranted price hikes. We have had both the existence and threat of brownouts in various parts of this country this year. That situation is only going to get worse until we do something about it. A noncontroversial but vitally important electricity reliability bill has passed this body. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to do the same. 
   Finally, on a regional issue, the great issue in the Pacific Northwest is the future of our hydroelectric dam system on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, and particularly the four dams on the lower Snake River. Many in this administration have pursued the foolish goal of removing those dams in order, the administration asserts, to save salmon. Nothing could be less cost effective as against the many absolutely first rate programs that are going on in the Pacific Northwest directly to that end, programs that not at all incidentally have been remarkably successful if we measure them by this year's return of spring chinook salmon to the Columbia River system. 
   The administration and the Vice President have blinked in this connection, knowing the proposal is as unpopular as it is absurd in the Pacific Northwest. One group in the administration said it would be off the table for 8 years. However, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality was cited in the course of the last month saying that moratorium will only be for 3 years, and the Vice President is not guaranteeing 3 years but just, ``as long as it [the present system] works.'' My own view is that that is until after the November election. 
   So to the best of my ability to do so, the administration will be given the opportunity to put its money where its mouth is with a prohibition against its using any money in the appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, not only for removing the dams but for any step or purpose on the road to removing those dams. The debate over salmon recovery, a universal goal in the Pacific Northwest, will be far more constructive and far more productive when that particular view is taken off of the agenda in its entirety. 
   Finally, as the Senator responsible for the management of the Interior appropriations bill, we must, of course, deal with the remaining fires across the United States in our forests and on our rangelands, and particularly again in the Northwest part of the United States from which my State has not been entirely free but with which it has not been afflicted to the extent that Montana, Idaho, and certain other States have been. Whatever our concerns about the causes of those fires, the expenditures that have been made and are to be made in connection with their suppression are a genuine emergency and will be included in the conference committee report on the Interior Department bill as an emergency. At the same time, due to the very hard work of my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, there are dramatic changes in fire prevention policies which will also be included in that bill that are vitally important to see to it that we do not soon have a repetition of the disastrous fires that have consumed so many hundreds of thousands, even millions of acres of our public and private lands during the course of this summer. 
   Mr. President, that is an ambitious agenda, but I believe it to be a vitally important agenda, not only for my own constituents but for the people of the United States as a whole.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, imagine 140 students who want to spend their summer learning math. For students participating in the Summer Math Program at Thomas Jefferson High School in Federal Way, Washington, this is just the case. For the past five years, Tom Norris and James Brown have worked tirelessly and created a successful program that has dramatically improved the math skills of hundreds of students. 
   When Mr. Norris and Mr. Brown started the Summer Math Program, they had five students in attendance. Since then, the program has become well-known throughout Thomas Jefferson High School as a resource for students struggling with math or hoping to improve their SAT scores and has grown by leaps and bounds. 
   The Summer Math Program is based on a three part system that includes: Advanced Algebra or Pre-Calculus, an SAT summer program, and ``The Math Team.'' The Advanced Algebra and Pre-Calculus course enables students who desire to complete Calculus before they leave high school to enroll in higher math classes in the following school year. The SAT summer program, offered at a much lower cost than other SAT review classes, equips students with the skills and confidence needed for their college preparatory exams. As a result, Thomas Jefferson High School has some of the highest SAT scores in the South Puget Sound of Washington State. 
   Additionally, students who enjoy competing in math competitions can participate on the Math Team. Students practice throughout the summer in preparation for the annual national competition which took place in July. As a true testament to the excellence of the program, Mr. Norris and Mr. Brown coached the team to a fifth-place victory last summer when the students participated against 50 other schools. This certainly was a great accomplishment for the program and students participating! 
   Samuel Kim, a Math Team member who will be a senior this year, told me that the Math Team, ``keeps you in the right frame of mind during summer so you can keep your math skills strong, and it gives you good interaction with others.'' Samuel had nothing but applause for his coaches stating, ``Mr. Norris is very friendly and inspirational, yet demanding and excited to see us succeed in competition, while Mr. Brown is more light-hearted in his motivational tactics.'' 
   The record of the Math Team and the achievements of students in the Summer Math Program speaks not only to the excellence of the program but also to the efforts and drive of both Mr. Norris and Mr. Brown. Their dedication to education, and math in particular, is rarely paralleled in other local school districts during the summer months. I am impressed with the dedication of these two men to their students' education even during the summer months. It is with great pleasure that I recognize them for their outstanding service to the students of Thomas Jefferson High School.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's attention today to Mr. Jim Sutton, a man who has given a generation of Kalama students a unique look at the courageous acts of an older generation--the men and women who fought in World War II. Mr. Sutton is the Superintendent of the Kalama School District and also finds the time to teach a course on World War II and the Cold War. Through his great personal interest in WWII and his desire to transfer some of his interest onto his students, Jim has made history come alive for them. 
   Mr. Sutton's class, based on the book Band of Brothers, by Stephen Ambrose, uses firsthand accounts of companies who were a part of D-Day in WWII. Ambrose's book documents the accounts of E Company, which the movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' was based. 
   Mr. Sutton has made it possible for his students to meet some of these great men who fought in WWII. Jim has brought an Italian officer that fought Rommel in the African Campaign, a P-51 pilot who brought actual video footage from his wing cameras, a machine gunner who landed at D-Day, and a German soldier who spent two years in a Russian prisoner of war camp. 
   Anyone can see how Mr. Sutton recognizes the sacrifices of the WWII generation and has shared it with others. Most impressive was in June when five of Mr. Sutton's students accompanied him to the opening of the D-Day museum in New Orleans, Louisiana where students were able to meet their history book heroes in person. 
   I have always considered my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards to highlight special people and programs, and this award demonstrates how innovative a typical U.S. history class can be. Mr. Sutton has created a live link between the past and the present for his students. 
   Greg Rayl, Principal of Kalama Middle and High School, who nominated Mr. Sutton for the award adds, ``Too often superintendents are many steps removed from the daily classroom management and operations of their district's schools. Jim not only walks the halls interacting with students and teachers, but teaches as well.'' 
   As an avid reader of history, I am delighted to learn about Mr. Sutton who has gone the extra mile to make history come alive for his students. I ask that the Senate join me in commending Mr. Sutton for his dedication to his students and for bringing two generations together.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on June 15, under the leadership of Chairman MCCAIN, the Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill reauthorizing and amendment the Pipeline Safety Act. This bill is, in my view, the single most important piece of legislation the committee will address this session. Following a June 10, 1999, accident in Bellingham, WA, that killed three children, blackened a magnificent city park, and sent shock waves through the community and State, Senator MURRAY and I have been working in front of and behind the scenes to see the Federal law regulating the operation of pipelines is changed: that communities and citizens are better informed about pipelines; that States can obtain a clear role in the oversight of interstate pipelines; that the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety adopts more meaningful safety standards; and that funding is increased for Federal and State pipeline safety operations. 
   While we are well on our way to accomplishing this last goal--the Senate has provided a significant increase in funding for the Office of the Pipeline Safety, and I have earmarked matching Federal funds for Washington State to supplement the funds appropriated by the State legislature for expanded safety activities--securing passage of the authorizing legislation has proven more difficult. I come to the floor to tell my colleagues that I will not rest in seeking the enactment of meaningful legislation this year. I am by nature a determined man, and my resolve on this issue has been strengthened by the example set by the Mayor of Bellingham, whose interest in this matter has not been half-hearted or expedient, but who has devoted and continues to devote time, resources, and thought to what we can do to make pipelines safer. I am committed to seeing that his efforts and my own are not in vain. 
   The bill that passed the Commerce Committee is a good one. It makes meaningful changes in Federal law. S. 2438 requires the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety to implement the recommendations of the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation by completing rulemakings that are long overdue, collecting better information to determine the causes of pipeline accidents, and providing better training to OPS inspectors. It accelerates the deadline for operators to prepare plans for training and qualifying their employees. It requires that information about pipeline incidents and safety-related conditions be made available to the public and that operators work with local communities to educate them about the location and risks of pipelines and what to do in case of an accident. The bill increases fines for violations, and explicitly provides a role for States in the oversight of interstate pipelines. It provides more funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety and direction on areas of research and development to focus on to improve safety. 
   In addition, the bill imposes on operators of pipelines of any length--not just longer pipelines as suggested by the administration--an obligation to conduct risk analyses and to adopt integrity management plans for high consequence areas--plans that provide for periodic assessments of pipelines' integrity. S. 2438 ensures that OPS will have easier access to operator information, and lowers the liquid spill reporting threshold to 5 gallons. It creates a national database of pipeline events and conditions. The bill contains protections for whistle blowers. Significantly, the bill also authorizes the Secretary to create a pilot program for State safety advisory committees to allow for meaningful citizen input into safety issues of local and State concern, and to monitor the performance of the Office of Pipeline Safety. 
   The bill, in summary, substantially improves current law. Unfortunately, in its current form, I am told, the bill will be stopped by a pipeline industry that can prevent its passage by getting any single Member to place a ``hold'' on the bill once the committee report is filed. At another time, however, when the Senate is able to debate the measure, the reforms could be much less palatable to industry. It has already been over a year since the fatal accident in Bellingham, and the public should not have to wait longer for improvements to the federal pipeline law. 
   While I led the effort to defeat amendments offered in the Commerce Committee that I thought undermined this legislation, I recognized then, as I do now, that some of the issues raised by industry should be and must be addressed if we are to enact legislation this year. 
   I have tried, since the committee passed the bill, to understand and address industry concerns in a reasonable manner. While I think we are getting close on a number of issues, I am growing impatient, particularly with the industry's continued opposition to allowing State and local input on pipeline safety issues of local concern. At some point--and this point will come very soon after our return from the August recess--I will ask my colleagues, one by one if necessary, to join me in voting for S. 2438 and a sound manager's amendment. I trust by that time they will be satisfied that the pipeline industry has had a fair opportunity to work out a reasonable compromise and that the time has come for Congress to act in the interest of all Americans.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to cheer the announcement by the Ford Motor Company that it will voluntarily improve the fuel economy of its fleet of sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over a period of 5 years. At a time when gas prices are skyrocketing and sales of SUVs are increasing, this announcement couldn't come at a better time. Ford's decision to make SUVs more fuel efficient is welcome news. I have long said that the industry has existing technology to allow cars to go farther on a gallon of gas and to save consumers money at the gas pump. Ford has set an example that other auto manufacturers should follow immediately. I am anxiously awaiting a response from the remaining two of the big three and hope they will join Ford in its pursuit of cleaner, more efficient vehicles. 
   I hope the manufacturers, now having pledged to improve fuel efficiency, will join me in my efforts to study an increase in corporate average fuel economy standards. As my colleagues know, I have long been an advocate of raising CAFE standards and scored a breakthrough victory earlier this year that paves the way for the Department of Transportation and the National Academy of Sciences, once again, to study fuel efficiency standards and their relationship to such issues as vehicle safety and to recommend the findings to Congress by July 1, 2001. I look forward to working with the automotive industry to ensure that this study is fair and balanced. 
   Many constituents and colleagues are surprised to learn of my advocacy for CAFE standards. My motivation is a simple one and is based on the success of the original CAFE standards statutes. I have never been swayed by doomsday predictions from automakers that claim they would be forced to manufacture a fleet of subcompact cars if we allowed the Department of Transportation to study and impose an increase in CAFE standards. We have come a long way from absolute opposition to a study of the issue to today's major announcement by the Ford Motor Company that will be of tremendous benefit to consumers who want cleaner, more efficient SUVs. This announcement reaffirms my faith in the ability of American automobile manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles that are the envy of the world. The debate over raising CAFE standards has come a long way, and I look forward to continuing this debate when Congress returns from its August recess.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on a third and separate subject, during the course of this past week, four Northwest Governors, two Republicans and two Democrats--the Governors of Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon--released a framework that shows great promise toward the recovery of endangered salmon on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. They have done so without recommending that any dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers be breached and destroyed. I agree wholeheartedly with the following statement from their plan:  
   The region must be prepared in the near term to recover salmon and meet its larger fish and wildlife restoration obligations by acting now in areas of agreement without resorting to breaching the four Snake River dams.  
   That is a reasonable statement. Unfortunately, it is not one which Vice President GORE and the Federal agencies now concerned with salmon enhancement endorse in their countervailing recommendations of today to keep moving forward with plans to destroy those dams. 
   I agree with the bipartisan Governors' plan in many of its elements, including the principle that performance standards must be scientifically based, subject to scientific peer review, reasonably obtainable, and measurable. I agree with the Governors that the National Marine Fisheries Service should work together with local, State, and tribal governments and private landowners on what specific improvements are needed for recovery. I agree with the Governors that we need real leadership and that the President of the United States should appoint one official in the region who will be accountable and who will efficiently oversee Federal agency fish recovery efforts. 
   Over the past decade, we have squandered more than a billion dollars and commissioned dozens of studies that have done little to promote a consensus on how best to save salmon. The Governors and I agree that local salmon recovery plans that avoid Federal methods of duplication and top-down planning are a much more effective method of saving salmon. I agree with the Governors that States should move ahead to designate priority watersheds for salmon and steelhead plans that are to be developed within 1 year and that the Federal agencies should have clear numerical goals so that success may be measured in those watersheds. 
   The appropriations subcommittee of this Congress last year directed the National Marine Fisheries Service to provide numerical goals for all of the listed fish in the Puget Sound and Columbia River regions and a schedule for all other areas and to provide this information to Congress by July 1 of this year. Instead of fulfilling this request, those agencies have said they will not have any goals until the fall of 2001 and that they have only begun the technical recovery planning for any species of fish they seek to recover. In other words, once again the administration says what we ought to do without knowing what those steps are designed to accomplish. 
   I agree with the Governors and their recommendation that the Army Corps  of Engineers, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must develop a long-term management plan to address predation by fish-eating birds and marine mammals, including seals and sea lions, and do so by the end of the year. I agree with the Governors that the National Marine Fisheries Service should work with the region to 
   conduct an intensive study to address the role of the ocean in fish recovery and ask that the management of fish and fresh water reflect new information about the ocean as it is developed. 
   In short, I believe the Governors have a plan that will work. I have supported millions of dollars in salmon recovery money to be given to the States and to local volunteer groups and will work with them. 
   On the other hand, today the National Marine Fisheries Service has come out with its top-down recommendations, recommendations that, I want to point out, once again call for very specific measures and steps to be taken but do not state any goals for recovery and do not allow us to know what they believe success will be or how that success will be measured. 
   In the course of the last week or 10 days, the newspapers in the Pacific Northwest have been filled with statements that the Federal Government had abandoned the idea of dam removal as an element in salmon recovery at least for a decade. And the implication was that they had abandoned it forever. 
   Not so, Mr. President. What does the biological opinion that was issued today say in that respect? 
   It says:  
   The reasonable and prudent alternative requires that further development of breaches as an option is necessary, and it requires the Corps of Engineers by fiscal year 2002 to seek appropriations to complete preliminary engineering and design work by 2005 for potential removal of the four lower Snake River dams.  
   It does that in spite of the fact that:  
   There is considerable uncertainty in assessing the status of listed fish under current conditions, and the alternative of breaching dams is highly dependent on the degree to which there is delayed mortality associated with juvenile fish passage at the dams and whether breaching would help even to answer these uncertainties.  
   Well, we have a set of Federal agencies that have disagreed with one another. The Corps of Engineers, a year ago, reached the conclusion that dam removal was a poor idea. It did so in spite of vastly underestimating, according to the General Accounting Administration, the adverse impacts on the society, the economy, and the environment of the Pacific Northwest. That recommendation was deleted from its formal opinion by orders of the White House. 
   Vice President Gore has visited the State of Washington on three or four occasions during the course of this year. Each time he has been asked to state his opinion on dam removal, including a specific request by one of his supporters, the Governor of Oregon. He has ducked, dodged, and defied any attempt to get him to reach a conclusion on that particular subject. But I think this biological opinion released by the administration today shows what that opinion is. It is very simple: We will fool the people of the Pacific Northwest by saying we have probably abandoned the idea between now and the 8th of November, and then under these recommendations we can change our mind very rapidly when they won't have a direct say over who will manage the next national administration. 
   Contrast that position with the forthright and unconditional pledge of Governor Bush that the removal of our dams, the destruction of our physical infrastructure, is not an option; that we can and will recover the salmon resources in the Pacific Northwest by the use of our imaginations and by following the advice of the people whose lives are affected by these decisions--a view that I believe is entirely consistent with the recommendations this week of the four Governors--two Republicans and two Democrats, as I have already pointed out--from the Pacific Northwest itself. 
   Well, we do have something to say about this issue. I pledge I will do everything I can between now and the adjournment of this Congress in late September or early October to see to it this administration is not allowed to waste any more money--not a single dollar--on further studies to remove dams on the Columbia-Snake River system. We will call them to account for their own policies. Their own policies now say this decision should be moved down the road. Fine. We will move the whole decision down the road and hope that we will have a President who will be mindful of the views of the people of the Pacific Northwest and, in the meantime, we are not going to let them waste money to build a case for removing dams that ought to stay in place. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am extremely pleased to co-sponsor the Electric Power Industry Tax Modernization Act. This legislation, when enacted, will contribute to a more reliable and efficient electric power industry that will provide benefits for all Americans connected to the interstate power grid. 
   I have been working for three years to resolve the tax problems for consumer-owned municipal utilities, those that are often referred to as Public Power. Nearly half the citizens of my state are served by Public Power. 
   These problems are due to outdated tax statutes that were written in a different era-an era where the emerging competition in the wholesale electricity market was not envisioned. The negative effects of these outdated tax provisions have impacted not only consumers of Public Power, but also tens of millions of other customers. Public Power is often prevented from sharing the use of their transmission systems solely due to these tax provisions. These outdated tax provisions are negatively impacting the reliability of entire regions of our nation, adding stress to an already stressed system. 
   In addition to Public Power, other types of utilities are prevented from adapting to this new era of emerging competition by other constraints in this outdated area of the tax law. All of these uncertainties have led to a condition where investment has slowed in this critical area of the economy, just as we need more investment to assure sufficient power plants and transmission lines to feed a growing economy that is increasingly dependent on reliable and affordable electricity. 
   This compromise bill includes the essence of my legislation, S. 386, The Bond Fairness and Protection Act that I introduced last year with Senator KERREY from Nebraska, a bill that includes an additional 32 co-sponsors in the Senate. This legislative language will allow Public Power to move into the future with certainty, and protects the millions of American citizens who hold current investments in Public Power debt. 
   The bill also includes legislative language that resolves conflicts for investor-owned utilities. These changes are also needed to solve problems in other parts of the outdated tax code as it pertains to electricity. The new provisions will also help contribute to a more reliable and orderly electricity system in our nation. 
   I look forward to gaining additional support for this bill among the other members of the Senate, and I look forward to the Finance Committee's consideration of this legislation in September. As soon as this legislation can be enacted, American electricity consumers will begin to enjoy a more certain and reliable future regarding their electricity needs.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, all last week I deferred coming to the floor to speak about my friend, Paul Coverdell, on the ground that it might be easier to do so this week. It is not. It is not, but it is vitally important to memorialize such a friend. 
   Every Monday evening or Tuesday morning, Paul Coverdell and I sat at the end of the table during leadership meetings in the majority leader's office, with an opportunity to comment on all of the issues that came before that group. Frequently, however, at the end of the table, we would exchange whispered remarks on some of the other people or subject matter, either present or not present. Paul Coverdell had a wonderful sense of humor, there and elsewhere: Dry, gentle, always to the point. It was a delightful pleasure to share those moments, sometimes stressful, sometimes marvelously relaxed, with such a man. 
   If you sought advice on a matter of vitally important public policy, Paul Coverdell was one of the first you would seek out. You knew that anything he would discuss with you would be filled with wisdom and common sense, and that stacking your remarks against his would focus and sharpen your own thoughts and your own ideas. It hardly mattered what the subject was--education, taxes, national security, a dozen others; the advice was always good and always relevant. 
   If you then sought tactics or advice on how to accomplish a shared goal, Paul Coverdell was a man whom you sought out. Particularly if there were an individual in your own party, or in the other party, whom you might be reluctant, for one reason or another, to approach, you could ask Paul Coverdell to do it for you, and he would. There was no task, there was no detail 
   that was too small for him, none that he thought was beneath him, if it was constructive, if it would help the cause in the long term. 
   One way in which you can determine individuals' reactions to other individuals is in a group. At the Republican conference meeting immediately before the Fourth of July recess, Paul Coverdell, as the Secretary of the conference, presented us a little plastic note card, the top of which read ``Republican Policy.'' I no longer remember the particular subject, but I do remember that first one or two people said, ``I don't agree with point 3.'' Pretty soon, everyone was piling on. Finally, one of our colleagues wrote across the top of this, ``One Republican's Policy,'' and handed it back to Paul Coverdell, who just went back to perfect his message. 
   Whom you tease, you generally love. That in many respects was an expression of the love and respect his Republican colleagues had for Paul Coverdell. 
   Paul Coverdell made us all proud of our profession, a profession often criticized, in fact a profession rarely praised. When a State sends a Paul Coverdell to the Senate, it is proof positive that our system works. And when the Senate of the United States listens to and respects and follows a Paul Coverdell, that, too, is proof that our system works. When, as was my privilege, you come to know and be befriended by a Paul Coverdell, you are especially privileged and especially honored. I was so privileged. I was so honored. 
   I will not know his like again.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my purpose to join with the Senator from Arizona today in introducing this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Each of us has thought long and hard about this proposed measure, as it goes to the heart of our air transport system in the United States. I believe I speak for the Senator from Arizona as well as for myself in saying this merger seems quite obviously to be beneficial both to United Airlines and to U.S. Airways. Public policy, however, does not concern itself primarily with the benefits to the companies involved in the competitive field. Public policy should concern itself with consumer interests and with the interests of the millions of Americans who use these airlines to fly from one place to another across the United States and for that matter overseas. 
   A merger of these two airlines would create by far the largest single airline in the United States. Inevitably, it seems to me that would lead to two more mergers, at the very least involving the other four of the largest six airlines in the United States. In fact, it would be almost impossible to mount a logical and rational defense against such mergers as those airlines would complain with real justification that they were no longer competitive with the giant created by a United-U.S. Airways merger. 
   From our perspective, we need to consider what the ultimate outcome of this merger would be and the impact it would have on airline passengers all across the United States. There would be a significant increase in the number of hubs overwhelmingly dominated by a single airline. There would be, in my view, a sharp decrease in the competition for airline travel in many cities across the United States. There would certainly be the legitimate desire on the part of the remaining airlines to maximize their profits. That exists at the present time. But these three mergers would vastly increase the ability of the airlines to do so in what would be distinctly a less competitive market. 
   I have attended hearings on this subject. I have had meetings with the CEOs of both airlines seeking to merge and with some of those who have apprehensions about that merger. I may say there are a number of ways in which my mind was changed by those meetings. My first reaction to the proposal was that the creation of one new entrant--D.C. Airlines--was little more than a sham. The hearings and my meetings indicated to me that I was almost certainly wrong in that respect, and that the proposed new owner and manager of D.C. Airlines did intend to be a real airline to provide real service. But even if we grant the potential success of that airline, the net effect on competition overall would be highly negative on the part of this merger. 
   I join with the chairman of the Commerce Committee in this resolution. I do not think in the ultimate analysis that this merger is in the public interest. I believe it would lessen competition among domestic airlines. I think it would not improve the way in which the airline passengers are treated, and probably, at least in the short term and perhaps in the long term, would exacerbate an already troublesome situation.  
   I believe we would end up with three major airlines flying roughly 80 percent of all the passengers on domestic flights in the United States, and that the net result, by a significant margin from such a merger, would not be in the public interest. 
   I hope this resolution becomes more formalized than it is just by the introduction by these two Members. I suspect the chairman of the Commerce Committee will bring it up in the Commerce Committee. I hope it is here for consideration by the entire Senate promptly, and it will be considered by the regulatory authorities that are dealing with the proposed merger at the present time.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, let's paint a picture, or set the stage, for this debate. 
   Most of the research and development and manufacture of prescription drugs goes on here in the United States, in a highly constructive fashion. Drug companies, and their research and development staffs, here in this country experiment and work, literally for years, to develop new and effective prescription drugs. 
   They are magnificently successful in that quest. And at least one of the reasons we are debating this issue today is that they are so successful that every year the share of our health care dollar that goes to prescription drugs increases because we now have conditions that can be treated by prescriptions that previously required hospitalization, if indeed they could be treated at all. 
   The process of taking an idea through its basic and applied research, its testing and its development to licensing by the Food and Drug Administration is long and arduous and is aimed both at safety and effectiveness. During that period of time, these companies spend a great deal of money with no return. It is clear, both to the proponents and opponents of both the first- and second-degree amendments,  that these companies are entitled to recoup those long and large costs of research and development. They are not only allowed, properly, to recoup the costs of those drugs that are actually brought to market, but the cost of all of the dead-end streets they run into with some of this research and development. To that point, there is agreement. 
   We are also dealing with a business, as any other in the United States, that spends a good deal of its time and effort in developing new products. Even at the early stage, there are some factors that favor the pharmaceutical industry because of its importance to the United States. It, as other companies, is entitled to a research and development tax credit, but it, unlike most other industries, also benefits hugely from research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, as the primary sponsor of this amendment well knows. So approximately half of all of these research and development costs are already 
   underwritten by the taxpayers of the United States, either through tax credits or through our direct appropriations to the National Institutes of Health. 
   It is at this point that the wonderful line from ``Alice in Wonderland'' comes to mind, and the situation becomes ``curiouser and curiouser.'' At the point at which these pharmaceutical products have been licensed, the actual manufacturing cost for that pill is, generally speaking, not very high. And so much of the price structure is to cover the research and development, the very large advertising costs to which the Senator from North Dakota referred, other marketing costs, the lobbying those companies do in the Congress, and a reasonable and, I may say, in most cases generous profit. But these U.S.-based, often U.S.-owned, pharmaceutical manufacturing companies consistently charge their American customers--not the individual patient in this case but the huge regional drugstore chains as well as individual pharmacies--far higher prices than they charge for the identical product overseas or across our northern and southern borders. 
   One would think in a normal market that prices would be nondiscriminatory or, if anything, the manufacturers would be grateful enough for the tremendous aid and assistance they receive from the taxpayers of the United States perhaps to give at least a small price break to American purchasers. But, no, as has been pointed out, they charge Americans pretty close to twice as much as they charge anyone else. These wholesale prices, obviously, are reflected in retail prices for the drugs. 
   My experience in the State of Washington is very much similar to that outlined both by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from North Dakota. We ran a little test; we went up to Canada, priced identical drugs in the State of Washington and in British Columbia, and found a 62-percent difference. In other words, it was way less expensive to buy them in Canada. So busloads of Americans go from Seattle and other parts of the State of Washington across the border to buy drugs and bring them back. 
   Why, one asks oneself, would American companies do this? Why would they discriminate against Americans? 
   They say: There is a simple answer to that. The Canadian Government, the Mexican Government, the Government of the United Kingdom, fix the prices of drugs. They want their citizens to get these pharmaceutical products less expensively than Americans do. So they, by government fiat, set the prices. And so we sell them, the drugs, for a lower price for a simple reason: We have already manufactured and sold lots of them in the United States. And when you go from the ten-millionth pill to the twenty-millionth pill, it doesn't cost you very much to manufacture those new pills, so we can still make a profit, even though we are selling them at half price in other countries. 
   Gee, isn't that unfair? Yes, I guess so, but that is the way the world is. 
   Now, that particular argument that price-fixing countries do much better for their consumers than a free market does in the United States is really a two-edged sword. It is one heck of an argument for price fixing in the United States. The junior Senator from Minnesota, a couple weeks ago, put up a proposal that would do exactly that, fix the price of drugs in the United States. This is a point at which I agree with the drug companies. They say: You fix prices and you will dry up research and development. I am not sure how far down we look for the validity of that argument, given the great excess of 
   advertising costs over research and development costs, but let us assume that it is totally and completely valid as an argument. Then under those circumstances, we shouldn't be fixing prices here in the United States. But that doesn't mean we should continue to allow Americans to suffer the immense discrimination that goes on consistently year after year, product after product in this country. 
   When I discovered the extent of this problem, basically out of a cover story in Time magazine--I believe it was last November--it seemed to me, as a former State attorney general who for an extended period of time was in charge of consumer protection, fine, you just tell them by law to stop discriminating. Don't charge Americans any more than you are willing to charge Canadians or Italians or citizens of the United Kingdom. 
   That is price fixing, the companies say. That is a terrible thing. 
   Well, it is not price fixing to say you don't discriminate. If you can't make a profit at a given price, you don't have to sell the drug in Canada or in any other place. 
   But they have a lot of money to spend trying to sell that bill of goods to people. So we discovered--again, I think this was as a result of my history as a State attorney general--that we have a statute in the United States that prevents price discrimination. It is called the Robinson-Patman Act. It was passed in 1936. It was a sweeping antidiscrimination bill. It prevents price discrimination in the sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, with certain exceptions for actual cost savings from quantity sales and the like. So we said, fine, and the bill we introduced just said interstate and foreign commerce, with respect to prescription drugs. 
   It is interesting; the drug companies paid no attention to that distinction at all, and they still use these millions of dollars to say it is price fixing. Well, if so, then we have fixed the price of every commodity in the United States for 64 years, which I think surprises most people who believe in and have benefited from the truly free economy in the United States. 
   The argument that this is price fixing is fraudulent--purely and totally fraudulent. But I am not wedded or married to one solution to this problem of excessive prices imposed on American consumers for their prescription drugs because while we ban importation by law--by custom at least--we have permitted for an extended period of time American citizens to cross our borders--northern or southern or, for that matter, across the ocean to Europe--and to return to the United States with a 3-month supply of any prescription drug they are using, without being bothered by any of the governmental agencies of the United States. Both of my other Senate colleagues in this regard have pointed out that that happens in their State, and I have already pointed out that it happens in mine. 
   So the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from North Dakota came up with the idea that if an individual can do it for himself or herself, why not let our pharmacists do it and bring these prescription drugs back to the United States, which are often manufactured in the United States and then shipped north 
   or south of the border--bring them back and offer them for sale, presumably at a lower price. 
   I am sure the Senator from Vermont doesn't mind my saying, in a sense, this solution is truly bizarre--that somehow or another it should be less expensive for a pharmacist to buy from a middleman than it should be from a manufacturer in the first place, and then have to ship the product across a national border twice in order to get the lower price. But the bizarre nature of the proposal is a simple and direct result of the outrageous discrimination that is practiced in the first place, and nothing else. 
   So the Senator from Vermont has written a bill and proposed an amendment to allow the retail seller, or the wholesaler, to engage in this reimportation. But concerned as he and the FDA are about making sure you  get the real thing, most of the words in his amendment have to do with the safety of the product, of making certain you are getting what it is that you thought you purchased. In fact, it doesn't allow this reimportation unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgates regulations permitting that reimportation that meet necessary safeguards. 
   OK, that is where we are at this point. And then, instead of simply opposing the proposal, my good friend from Mississippi puts up a second-degree amendment that says the Secretary has to certify to Congress that it would pose no risk to public health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost. It is either absolutely unnecessary, because we are talking about something the Secretary has already done, and the price part of it is unnecessary because if there isn't a significant savings in the price, nobody is going to go up and buy them in the first place or it is an attempt--and I regret to say this--to kill the amendment of the Senator from Vermont in its entirety and see to it that it doesn't happen. The drug companies and their sponsors are not really wanting to justify the situation that exists in the United States today because it can't be justified, so they use an argument for safety that is already far more adequately covered by the amendment proposed by the Senator from Vermont in any event. 
   Now we are able to deal with this issue as part of this appropriations bill, of course, because the House of Representatives did. So it is properly before us. But the other matter that I find extraordinarily odd with respect to the second-degree amendment is just this: The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the manager of the bill, knows perfectly well that individuals can go across our borders and come back with a 3-month supply of prescription drugs. If he and the Senator from Wisconsin are so concerned about safety that they have to pile on with a second-degree amendment, why aren't they banning totally and completely personal reimportation? The Senator from Vermont isn't even touching that subject in his amendment. I wish he did. The House of Representatives did. He is setting up a way for reimportation to take place at the wholesale level, where safety is far more protected than it is with respect to these individual purchases. 
   But the individual purchases have not created a great problem. If they had, people would stop engaging in those policies. Whatever else we may say about Canadians, they are not in the business of poisoning their own citizens. 
   This reimportation can take place with perfect safety under the amendment as proposed by the Senator from Vermont, and 
   anything added to it is simply an attempt to kill it and to maintain the status quo. 
   Let me go back to the stage I have set and simply say this: The status quo is American manufacturers using American taxpayers' money to produce products in the United States of America, which they then sell at prices that discriminate outrageously against American purchasers. That is really all there is on the stage today--discrimination by American companies against American purchasers, in spite of the support of American taxpayers. 
   The first-degree amendment takes at least a modest step toward curing that situation. The second-degree amendment is designed to keep it in place forever. 
   I have one final point, Mr. President. I agree with each of the Senators who have previously spoken on the desirability and the importance of a Medicare drug benefit. There is some debate over to whom it should apply, how much it should cost. But Medicare covers about 40 million Americans. We have 250 million Americans altogether. None of the rest of them will be helped at all by even the most generous Medicare drug benefit. All of them will be helped by this amendment, to the extent that it is actually effective, because it will in fact end up lowering the price of prescription drugs in the United States of America. That is why the first-degree amendment should be adopted and the second-degree amendment that attempts to gut it should be rejected.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at the closing of this bill, this is one more opportunity for me to thank my colleague, Senator BYRD, for his guidance, cooperation, and many courtesies in moving this bill through to final passage. He has been very complimentary of me. I can simply say that much or most of what I have learned about managing a bill I have learned from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and I hope he regards me as an apt pupil. 
   I also thank his staff for all of their hard work. The minority clerk, Peter Kiefhaber, who is new to this job, has been a tremendous asset to the subcommittee and has been a forceful advocate for Members on his side of the aisle. Peter has been ably assisted by Carole Geagley of the minority staff, and by Scott Dalzell, who has been with us on detail from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   My own subcommittee staff has also had the benefit of an agency detailee--Sheila Sweeney from the Forest Service. Sheila has kept her good humor even while struggling to track the thousands of Member requests that the subcommittee receives from Members of this body. We have enjoyed having her with us. She has been extremely productive. 
   The subcommittee professional staff on my side has done yeoman work: Ginny James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joe  Norrell, and Christine Drager, who is in her first year with the subcommittee. All have contributed to making the passage of this bill a relatively smooth process, something I think speaks well of their dedication, professionalism, and knowledge of the programs and issues in this bill. 
   Finally, of course, there is my chief subcommittee aide, 
   Bruce Evans, who has guided this bill in each of the years that I have worked on it. I could not possibly have any better staff. I am certain that no Member of the Senate has better, more dedicated, or more effective staff in seeking passage of a particular bill. 
   I also thank Kari Vander Stoep of my own personal staff for her outstanding work on the issues in this bill that are of particular importance to the people of the State of Washington. 
   As many hours as we put in here on the floor, each of these individuals has spent that multiplied by 10 in late nights and early mornings, in literally months of putting the bill together. They are likely to do exactly the same as we go through to the conference committee and final adoption of the bill. 
   I express my gratitude for their good work and the appreciation, I am sure, of Senator BYRD and of the Senate as a whole.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the marriage tax penalty is an injustice in the Federal income Tax Code that results in a married couple filing a joint return paying more in taxes than if the same couple were not married and filed as individuals. Today, the Senate will vote to end this injustice. 
   There is no question that the American people, both married and single, are troubled and upset by the marriage tax penalty, and that they are telling Congress and the President to end this injustice in the Tax Code. I know every one of my 99 colleagues in the Senate receives letters like those that arrive in my mail every day from Washington state--letters urging support for legislation to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. 
   I will share just one of the hundreds and hundreds I have recently received. The Gaylord's of Sumner, Washington wrote to me and described how they learned of the penalty the Tax Code imposed on them for being married when preparing their tax filings for this year. The letter reads, ``Here is what I did to see the penalty: I simply clicked on the `single' box on my wife's return (as it is on the computer, it is a simple thing to do) and her tax went from sending $400 to the IRS, to an instant recalculation of getting $500 back!'' Computer tax software made it easily and brutally clear to the Gaylord's that they were being punished by the Tax Code for being married to each other, that they would pay less in taxes if they were single. 
   Mr. President, the marriage tax penalty is as outrageous as it is indefensible. President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto this marriage tax penalty legislation. President Clinton should reverse his threatened veto, sign marriage tax penalty legislation into law and bring fairness to the Tax Code. No longer should those who fall in love and get married be penalized by the Tax Code.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now back for the final 3 and one-quarter hours of debate on amendments to the Interior appropriations bill. Any Member who reserved an amendment to that bill may present it between now and 6:15 this evening, at which time, by unanimous consent, we go to the marriage penalty bill for what may be an extended series of votes. Any of the amendments reserved on the Interior bill will be voted on, if, in fact, the vote is necessary, tomorrow morning. 
   I list 12 amendments that were reserved for debate during this period of time. I am informed by staff that we have settled 4 of them. That leaves eight amendments: two by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN; one by the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER; one by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN; one by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. LIEBERMAN; one by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. NICKLES; one by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED; one by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. THOMAS. 
   Curiously enough, most of these Senators who have said they will be here from between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock p.m., which takes a considerable portion of the debate time, are away. I think some of those eight amendments I have listed will themselves be settled without debate or by agreement. If any of the seven Senators whose names I have just mentioned are within hearing and sight of this debate, I urge that Senator to reach the Senate floor promptly. At this point they have a real opportunity to present their amendments. Later on, they are likely to be very constricted as to time. 
   Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just under 2 hours ago, at the outset of this debate, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, came to the floor with an eloquent plea about the lack of money to properly manage Great Smokey National Park and pointed out the tremendous challenges to that major national park in our system. The Senator from Nevada, the other Mr. REID, spoke in agreement with that proposition. The Senator from Tennessee did not have an amendment to increase the appropriations for Great Smokey National Park or for any other. 
   I have found it curious that in the several years I have managed this bill and written this bill, almost without exception the amendments that are brought to the floor are amendments to increase the amount of money we donate to other units of Government for their primary purposes and almost never do they express a concern for increasing the amount of money to support the functions of the Government of the United States itself. 
   I have gone a long way--my committee has gone a long way--in drafting this bill at least to begin to make up for the deferred maintenance in our national parks and in our national forests and with respect to our Indian reservations and our Indian programs and the management of the Bureau of Public Lands. I think we have at least turned the corner. As I said in my opening remarks on the bill, this is our primary function and our primary goal; that is, to see to it that we manage the public lands of the United States and the other functions in this bill that are exclusively Federal functions first and deal with other matters later. 
   I sympathize with the eloquent statement of the Senator from Rhode Island. In fact, I have supported that case in this bill for several years. When one compares this appropriation with that in the first year during which I managed this bill, it is increased by a good 20 percent. But here we have a proposal to add another $8 million, which will come out of every program for which the U.S. Government has exclusive responsibility. It will mean there will be less--not much less, but there will be less --for Great Smokey National Park. There will be less for the Fish and Wildlife Service and its multitude of obligations. There will be less for the Smithsonian Institution. There will be less for research and development of the very programs for energy efficiency which are the key to providing both energy independence and the proper and efficient use of energy. 
   With all respect to the Senator from Rhode Island, this has nothing to do with the tax debate. We have a budget resolution and a set of allocations that have given this committee a fixed number of dollars with which to work. I repeat that: a fixed number of dollars with which to work. It is all spent in this bill. So we can't just add this $8 million or $18 million to the bill and say, well, let's take it out of a tax cut or out of a budget surplus or the like. The Senator from Rhode Island recognizes that. He has a match for this $8 million. But I simply have to repeat: The match is from the primary functions of the Federal Government, the management of our national parks and forests, the energy research we undertake, the cultural institutions of the United States. That is from where this match comes. 
   A year ago, we said: If this program is so important to the States, let's require them to match what we come up with by 25 percent. Let them come up with 25 percent. Some States do 
   provide some money for this. We had to postpone that for a year. In this bill we have had to have a way to grant State waivers, when States regard this program evidently as so lacking in importance that they are not willing to put up 25 percent of the money for their own citizens for something that is primarily their responsibility. 
   As I said, we are $3 million above the level for the current year. The House is $5 million above the level for the current year. If we end up with a larger allocation--and, personally, I hope for a larger allocation--by the time the conference committee has completed its  work, we will have a modestly larger amount of money for this program in a final conference committee report. But it is not responsible to take it out of our National Park System. It is not responsible to take it out of our existing energy research. It is not responsible to take it out of the cultural institutions of the United States. That is precisely what this does.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first, there is another far more important program and far more expensive program that goes to these very issues. The appropriations bill for military construction included many other matters. There was $600 million more for the direct assistance to people with their heating oil bills. In some respects, this is every bit as important a program because it tries to lower the bills in the first place. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island is correct; this is a small percentage of the budgets for the national parks. It is also the subject of match for several other amendments here because it is so easy. We don't say this program is much more important than another program, so let's cut the other program; we just say, in effect, cut them all across the board. But it is $8 million more in deferred maintenance for our national parks, or for our other national lands. And since this is a program that, over the course of the last 5 years, has increased more rapidly, bluntly, than the amount of money we have for these primary responsibilities, that is the reason we came up with the amount that we did. 
   Would I have liked to come up with more? Yes. If I have a larger allocation later, I will. Will there be more? There will be. I don't think at this point, for a State program, that many States aren't matching--and the requirement for match is only 25 percent--that this is as important as the national priorities that are the subject of the rest of this bill.

I must say, without going into it, I think there are several serious policy questions about this amendment, but more than that I think it needs to be resolved in the context of a reauthorization of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. I understand the Senator from Connecticut is working with the chairman of the committee on that, and so we can defer our final decision until tomorrow.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have about 5 minutes remaining. The Senator from Nevada is going to introduce two additional amendments, quite appropriately, before that. 
   In connection with this amendment, however, I need to say that this amendment causes a conflict on my part more than any other here. I agree with the amendment. I think the power has been misused. I am not sure it can be reversed by another President. The Senator from Idaho seems to feel that it can be. But I believe we have had a number of actions that have raised far more questions than they have actually settled. 
   By the same token, I know perfectly well if this amendment is in the bill that goes to the President, the President will veto the bill. I simply say, since I know my friend from Nevada will be on the conference committee, I don't intend to send a bill to the President that we don't believe he ought to sign, at the very least. I just have to leave that notice at this point. 
   We have 4 more minutes. I will say one other thing. At least in theory, amendments can be brought up and discussed to this bill--the amendments that are listed in the unanimous consent agreement--and they could be further discussed after the end of the many votes that we have tonight. 
   I yield the floor to the Senator from Nevada so he can introduce the remaining amendments.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an outstanding representative of Washington State, Jan Stewart. Ms. Stewart will soon complete her year as national president of the American Assocaition of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). I am very pleased that one of Washington State's own was tapped as the 1999-2000 president of this prestigious national organization. 
   The AANA is the professional association that represents over 27,000 practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Founded in 1931, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists is the professional association representing CRNAs nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics given to patients each year in the United States. CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia provider in over 65 percent of rural hospitals, affording these medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma stabilization capabilities. They work in every setting in which anesthesia is delivered, including hospital surgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, and plastic surgeons. 
   Jan has been a nurse anesthetist since 1982. She received her extensive anesthesia training at the Mayo School in Rochester, Minnesota.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I strongly support elimination of the federal Death Tax. The Death Tax is an injustice that should be removed from the tax code. The bill the Senate is considering, which passed the House of Representatives with a large, bipartisan majority, takes a responsible approach to ending the Death Tax by phasing-out the tax rate over a decade, and at the end of that decade eliminating the capital gains step-up in basis and creating a carryover basis to treat families with fairness upon the death of a loved one. 
   It is simply wrong for the Tax Collector to knock on a grieving family's door to collect taxes on the life's work and earnings of the recently deceased. There are those who charge that the Death Tax affects only the richest Americans. Apparently, they have never met the Revesz family from Battle Ground, Washington. Peter and Jane Revesz are family tree farmers, and they recently wrote to me to express their fear that the federal Death Tax may mean their farm will have to be sold and the forestland lost to development. To those who claim ending the Death Tax affects only the rich, I challenge you to listen to their words. Peter and Jane wrote to me that the Death Tax could cause the ``loss of so much of our farm and timber to taxes when we die that our children and grandchildren will lose the farm. ..... For us to have sustainable, productive timber on a family farm means that every year or two we need to have a small harvest and that the profits go to the family. To accomplish this in a 60 or more year cycle it is necessary to have a considerable value in the timber so that there can be small but steady harvest and reforestation over a long growth cycle. If much of this long-term crop is lost with each generation to estate taxes, it is impossible to continue a sustainable income for the family or a sustainable annual supply of wood products for the public. Often if a family loses a tree farm, that land becomes something other than forestland. If one family cannot make it, probably the next one cannot make it.'' 
   These are not the words of the greedy rich, they are the honest words of hardworking Americans who simply question why part of the farm they have built-up must be sold to pay the government because they die. Uncle Sam did not maintain and care for the farm, why is the government due a portion of it upon the death of its owners? 
   I have heard from many constituents who share this very real fear that the Death Tax will cause their children to have to sell the family farm or business to be able to pay the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Oak Harbor Freight Lines is a family owned business in Auburn, Washington, about 15 miles outside Seattle. Ed Vander Pol and his brother David began working at the business in the early 1970s when Oak Harbor had around 100 employees. As the years went by, Ed and David bought the business from their father and grew it to where it is today: a thriving regional trucking line with over 1100 employees. Out of those 1100, over 700 are union workers; Teamsters, mainly, driving the freight trucks and doing other jobs within the company. Naturally, Ed and David would like to keep this business in the family, and not have to sell the company to a larger, national carrier when they die. 
   But for all their hard work, the Vander Pol's have been rewarded with uncertainty about their company's future. They must pay a yearly life insurance bill of over $150,000--dedicated solely to helping their children pay the onerous Death Tax bill that will be due, in cash, nine months after Ed or David dies. If not for the Death Tax, this money would be re-invested in the business and its people, growing the company and providing additional well paying jobs to people in the Seattle area. 
   Why should Ed and David's children have to pay a tax to the federal government upon the death of their father? Those who fight elimination of the death tax refuse to answer this basic question; they refuse to justify its existence. Instead of directly telling the American people why they oppose ending this disgraceful tax, they choose to dust-off tired ``tax cuts for the rich'' rhetoric. The American people deserve honest, straight-forward answers: Those who oppose elimination of the Death Tax simply believe they know better how to spend your money than you and your children. They want to control your pocketbook both when you are alive and when you are dead. They oppose tax reform and tax cuts, whether it is ending the death tax or fixing the marriage penalty, because it means less money for them to spend from Washington, DC. 
   Ending the Death Tax is about protecting hard work, honoring responsible saving and investment, and protecting family farms and small businesses. The federal government should stop punishing those who pursue the American dream and restore some fairness to the tax code by eliminating the federal Death Tax.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are finally back on the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior. We will be on it from now until 6:30 this evening, when I understand we go back to the Defense authorization bill. 
   We have made some very real progress in the last 24 hours in the sense that we have a finite list of amendments that can be brought up on this bill. The difficulty is that, as I count them, there are 112 of those amendments that are in order at this point. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia and I both hope and believe that many of them will not be brought up, but this is notification to Members that if they are interested in having their amendments discussed, if they want to get the views of the managers of the bill on those amendments, they should be prompt. We want to hear from everyone this afternoon because we want to finish the bill today or, more likely, tomorrow. 
   One amendment that is ready to go is the amendment proposed by the senior Senator from Minnesota, together with the junior Senator from Minnesota, that is technically, I believe, the business of the Senate at the present time. I now see both Senators from Minnesota here, prepared to deal with that amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico is correct, but I really need to say more to respond to him in the affirmative. He has perhaps been the most eloquent, though he has been certainly strongly supported by the Senator from North Dakota on that side of the aisle, our friend, Senator INOUYE, from that side of the aisle, and the Senators from Arizona, in attempting at least to begin with the huge backlog in the absolute necessity of constructing new Indian schools that are 100 percent our responsibility and for renovating and repairing those that can constructively be renovated and repaired. 
   The Senator from New Mexico also knows how difficult this has been in past years because while the President of the United States has always asked us for big increases in the budget really for spending more money than we thought overall was appropriate to spend, he has always ignored these Indian school needs. 
   This year, in this budget, the President did dramatically reverse himself and did ask for a generous appropriation for new Indian school construction. That partnership, and the bipartisan partnership on the floor of the Senate, gave me the ability of drafting this bill to begin both appropriate new construction and a large number of repairs and rehabilitation. 
   I would be deficient in my own duty if I did not say that the first person who saw this need--not only saw this need but spoke eloquently to this need--was the Senator from New Mexico.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have at least three reasons to urge adoption of the amendment of the Senator from Maine. The first, of course, is the eloquence that she has evidenced in presenting it and her persistence in pursuing this particular course of action. 
   Second is that this is directly analogous to the first amendment we adopted today by the two Senators from Minnesota. It is a decision, effectively, that we have already made that this money should be appropriated on an emergency basis. It is included in another bill that is slower to pass. Unfortunately, it was not included in the military construction bill, which did have a number of emergency expenditures in it. 
   The third comes even closer to home for this Senator because, as the Senator from Maine knows, Washington and Oregon, and for that matter, California, do have listed salmon species. 
   I may say to the Senator from Maine, we got an advance appropriation and it didn't prevent the listings from taking place, by any stretch of the imagination. But I think it did help my State and the other two States to prepare for what is going to be a long campaign toward their recovery. The hope that a listing may be prevented is a worthy goal on the part of the Senator from Maine. But even if it doesn't happen, this will have helped in connection with whatever the steps are thereafter. If the junior Senator from Maine would not mind, we can accept this amendment now and, of course, give other Senators an opportunity to speak. So she is ahead and she might as well win while she has a chance.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader has indicated that he hopes we can continue debating this bill and finish it tonight, or at least get to a point tonight where it can be finished, perhaps, with a vote on final passage tomorrow. I think that is possible, and this will be part of it. 
   So I hope the Senator from Illinois will finish his remarks on it. We will ask for a rollcall, and then we will set voting on it aside until we find out how many other amendments there are. I believe the Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, wishes to come in with an amendment that would require a vote. The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, may have an amendment. Senator NICKLES may have one. I am not sure about the Senator from Alabama. But there are a fairly small number that will require votes. I strongly suggest that anyone who feels that his or her amendment cannot be accommodated as a part of a managers' amendment--and we have a very large one now that includes many of the proposals made--if anybody wants to have a vote or debate, they really need to be on the floor very promptly to do so because we would like to go ahead and finish. With that, I thank the Senator from Illinois.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with all respect, it seems to this Senator that this amendment is more about the National Endowment for the Arts than it is about the Indian Health Service. 
   To give a comparison, the amount of money for the Indian Health Service in this bill is more than $2.5 billion. The amount for the National Endowment for the Arts cultural institutions is $105 million. As a consequence, this amendment would add to the Indian Health Service something less than one-third of 1 percent of the budget of the Indian Health Service --something less than one-third of 1 percent. It would subtract from the National Endowment for the Arts some 7 percent of the amount of money appropriated to it. 
   Our bill provides a $143 million increase for the Indian Health Service for next year over the current year, more than the entire appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts. I find it ironic it was less than an hour ago that this Senator was praised by the Senator from New Mexico, who is a vocal advocate for the Indian Health Service, for the generosity with which we were treating that service. 
   Of the amount we are talking about for the Indian Health Service, $56 million is specifically for improved clinical services, which obviously could include diabetes treatment and prevention efforts. But even more significant in connection with this amendment is the fact that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides $30 million a year for 5 years specifically to accelerate diabetes efforts for Native Americans. This year is the fourth such year. So there is $30 million for the fourth consecutive year for the specific purpose of this amendment. 
   On the other hand, the National Endowment for the Arts has not had a single increase in its funding since 1992. In many respects, the $7 million increase for the National Endowment for the Arts is symbolic; $7 million is real, but in a sense it is symbolic--but it is an important symbol. It is far less than the President's budget has in it. In fact, one of the elements in the long letter from the Executive complaining about this bill is that we are not generous enough with the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   But when we had our great debates on that subject during the mid-1990s, one of the focal points of the debate was that the National Endowment for the Arts was not using its money correctly and was funding objectionable artistic efforts, objectionable groups, and organizations and individuals. In the intensity of the debate, I believe in 1995 and 1996, an extensive list of reforms was imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts with respect to the way in which it spent its money and made its grants. 
   Now far more of its money goes to grants to the States. More of its money is spread more broadly around the United States, particularly to relatively small communities rather than a concentration in New York and Washington, DC, and Los Angeles and San Francisco. In other words, the very reforms that were demanded by the Congress have been, I think, cheerfully and thoroughly carried out by the National Endowment for the Arts in a manner quite responsive to what Congress asked for. To continue to punish the Endowment for the sins of its predecessors, or the supposed sins of its predecessors, seems to me to be perverse. I do not believe it appropriate for literally the 10th straight year either to reduce or freeze the 
   appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I would have to say I think it is doing good work. It is one of those fields in which relatively small grants provide sort of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval to a multitude of arts organizations around the country, and provides a tremendous help to them in securing private contributions for their efforts. Some say the money that we provide through the National Endowment for these organizations comes back tenfold, fiftyfold, a hundredfold in private and local contributions. 
   It does seem to me long past time that we recognize the changes in the National Endowment and reward them for a job well done, even though the reward contained in this bill is modest. I said 2 days ago when this debate began that last year we included such a modest increase. The House was adamant about freezing the appropriation for the Endowment and we ultimately receded to the House. I said then I don't intend that should happen this year. I think it is time for the House to recede to us. I think it is time to deal fairly with an important part of the culture of the United States, and I think this amendment is unnecessary for the purpose for which it is stated because we have far more money in the bill already for the purpose of this amendment than is included in the amendment itself. 
   I believe we should leave this modest increase and encourage the National Endowment for the Arts to continue the good work and to continue to follow the dictates of this Congress about the way in which it does that work, rather than to continue to punish it for perceived past sins which I am now convinced have long since been cured. 
   For that reason, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill includes a $143 million increase for the Indian Health Service, an amount much larger than the entire appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts. Due to the work of Senator DOMENICI, there is a $30 million-a-year entitlement for the very subject of diabetes control for Indians that is already a part of the funding of Indian programs in the United States. 
   The National Endowment for the Arts, which has abided by all of the restrictions put on it over the last several years by this body, has not had an increase since 1992. This is a fair and modest increase for the National Endowment for the Arts. It ought to be rewarded for following the commands of Congress, itself. The money is not needed for the purposes of the amendment because that function is already very generously supported both in this bill and through an entitlement.

   I also ask unanimous consent that all amendments and debate be concluded during Monday's session and the votes occur at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, with the bill being advanced to third reading and passage to occur after disposition of these amendments, all without any intervening action or debate. Further, I ask unanimous consent that additional relevant second degrees be in order if necessary to the first degree after disposition of any offered second-degree amendment on Tuesday. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, which will be the entire Interior Subcommittee.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a provision contained in H.R. 4205, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, regarding the conveyance authority for utility systems at U.S. military installations. The House proposes to change existing law in a manner that jeopardizes the ability of a municipal utility in Washington, Tacoma Power, to participate in the competitive selection process and acquire Fort Lewis' electric utility system. Fort Lewis is Washington's major Army base. I oppose changes to DOD's current conveyance authority, when that change impedes competition. 
   The Department of Defense is privatizing utility systems at military bases throughout the county. Military bases are considered Federal enclaves, and therefore are subject to Federal, rather than State, law. The language contained in H.R. 4205 dramatically weakens existing Federal law by subjecting military bases to State laws, regulations, rulings and orders in the competitive bid process of their utility systems. This would have a negative impact on DOD utility privatization efforts in my state of Washington. The reason for this is that utility service territories in Washington are established by service area agreements--contracts--rather than by State decree. Eliminating the Federal law that applies on military bases would create a host of legal questions, the effect of which is to foster litigation and undercut the DOD privatization process in Washington. 
   Because I am not a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and would therefore not be privy to Conference Committee negotiations, I respectfully request your assistance in assuring that whatever utility language is included in the FY01 Defense Authorization bill properly takes into account the unique circumstances of Washington.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is not often that over 8,000 kids from all over the world are brought together to celebrate their creativity and problem solving skills, but thanks to a program called Destination ImagiNation, it became a reality in May of this year when Destination ImagiNation held their Global Finals at Iowa State University. A five-student team from Pioneer Middle School in Wenatchee, Washington were able to participate in the D2K finals and were a great success when they finished fourth in the ``Instant PUDDING Improv'' category. 
   Destination ImagiNation is a non-profit corporation that offers young people a chance to participate in a global, youth-centered, creative problem solving program. The Destination ImagiNation program has two components: ``Instant Challenges'' that teach students to take what life is handing them moment to moment and requires them to solve a challenge on the spot; ``Team Challenges'' use art, technology, performance, and real world relevance as they tackle one of the six challenges, that can take from several weeks to several months to develop. 
   The team from Pioneer Middle School included Carly Faulkner, Kari Opp, Whitney Faulkner, Jessica Pinkston and Aaron Galbraith. Utilizing their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, these amazing individuals were able to perform an improvisational story with only a half and hour to prepare. Not only were there time limits, but they were given predetermined props and a list of 12 people, places, and times that had to be incorporated into their performance. 
   Can you imagine having to correlate Ghandi, the Egyptian Pyramids, Tinkerbell, and someone winning a million dollars in the Lotto into a coherent and entertaining piece? Successfully, the 8th graders were able to accomplish just that. Surely, this takes a tremendous deal of teamwork and quick thinking! 
   Their coach, Shelly Skaar, who is a librarian for the East Wenatchee School District, has been with the team twice at the D2K competition. ``The impact on the kids has built their teamwork, problem solving abilities, and even incorporates acting into how they compete,'' says Shelly. 
   Clearly, this is a confidence building tool that allows children to capitalize on their creativity and be proud of their ideas. I applaud the positive nature of Destination ImagiNation, and am glad that so many children across the nation and around the globe are taking part in such an original competition.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001. The bill totals $15.474 billion in discretionary budget authority, an amount that is more than $600 million over the current year level but almost $1 billion lower than the administration's budget request. The bill is right at its 302(b) allocation, and as such any amendments must be fully offset. 
   Drafting this bill is always a great challenge, in large part because it funds programs and activities that have a direct and tangible impact on the constituents that we represent. This is particularly true for those of my colleagues from western States that contain large amounts of Federal and tribal lands. But aside from the usual challenges posed by the Interior bill, this year's version has been especially difficult given the lofty expectations raised by the administration's rather extravagant budget. The administration's request amounts to an increase of 11 percent overall--a hefty increase in light of our ongoing efforts to maintain some degree of control over Federal spending. The bill before the Senate contains a more reasonable increase of about 5 percent--an amount that I think is appropriate as we attempt to fashion an overall budget that protects Social Security and Medicare, reduces the national debt, and provides for sensible tax relief. 
   Despite the more modest funding levels contained in this bill, I can assure my colleagues that the bill is a responsible product that is responsive to the most pressing needs of the land management agencies; the agencies that provide health, education and other services to Indian people; the several cultural institutions under the subcommittee's jurisdiction; and a number of Department of Energy programs that are particularly relevant today in light of the recent rise in gasoline prices. 
   In drafting this bill in consultation with the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator BYRD, I have followed a number of basic principles. 
   First, the bill provides nearly 100 percent of the money required to fund increases in fixed costs such as pay and benefits. These are cost increases over which the subcommittee has little or no control. Failure to provide these funds simply means agencies must reduce services or program delivery from current year levels. For the Interior bill as a whole, these fixed cost increases total more than $300 million in FY 2001. Providing this amount simply to maintain current levels of service takes a large bit out of the overall increase in the subcommittee's allocation. 
   Second, I have placed a high priority in those agencies and functions for which the Federal Government has sole or primary responsibility. Providing for the core operating needs of the land management agencies continues to be a central priority in this bill. We have also tried to provide adequate sums for the operation and maintenance of the Smithsonian, the National Gallery, and the Kennedy Center--institutions that are our direct responsibility. Finally, we have done our very best to provide for the core needs of the Indian peoples for whom we have trust responsibility--partiuclarly in the area of health services and education. 
   The third major principle that has guided me in developing this bill really flows from the second. For years, I  have listened to Senator DOMENICI, Senator DORGAN, Senator CAMPBELL, and others talk in hearings, markups, and casual conservation about the need for major investment in the construction and repair of Indian schools. I have been shown pictures of Indian schools in other States to which none of us would want to send our own children, and am aware of schools in my own State that are in desperate need of repair or replacement. Much like Department of Defense schools, these Indian schools are the direct responsibility of the Federal Government. In many cases, however, they look very little like Department of Defense schools, and are not in a condition that we would allow to occur within the DOD school system. 
   As chairman of the Interior subcommittee, it has been frustrating to not be able to respond to such a pressing need in anything more than an incremental manner. But given the difficult spending constraints under which the committee has been operating for a number of years, it has been impossible to make significant progress on this issue without it being identified as a priority in administration budget requests. This year, however, the administration has responded to the pleas of my colleagues--a development that apparently was spurred by the President's recent visit to Indian country. The FY 2001 budget request includes dramatic increases for both new school construction and repair and rehabilitation of existing schools. While the bill before you does not provide 100 percent of the request, it does provide an increase of $143 million for BIA school construction and repair. This amount is enough 
   to complete the next six schools on the construction priority list, as well as provide an $84 million increase for the repair and rehabilitation account. Maintaining these funding levels will be one of my highest priorities in conference with the House. 
   Adhering to these fundamental principles while remaining within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation did not leave a great deal of room for other program increases. As a result, there is perhaps less in this bill for land acquisition, grant programs, and specific member projects than some would like. I think, however, that the bill reflects the right set of priorities. I have attempted to allocate available resources to the most compelling needs identified in agency budget requests, as well as to the particular priorities identified to me in the more than 2,000 individual requests I have received from Members of this body. I regret not being able to do more of the things that my colleagues have asked me to do, but want to assure Members on both sides of the aisle that I have made every effort to treat these requests in a fair and even-handed manner. 
   While I do not wish to belabor the details, I do want to take a moment to point out a few highlights of the bill for the benefit of my colleagues who have not had a chance to review it closely. For the land management agencies, the bill provides significant increases for core operational needs. 
   The bill provides an increase of $80 million for operation of the National Park System, including more than $25 million for increases in the base operating budgets of more than 80 parks and related sites, including the U.S. Park Police. These increases build on similar increases that have been provided for the past several years. The bill also provides an increase of $11 million for the National Park Service to continue efforts to research and document fundamental scientific information on the biological, geological, and hydrological resources present in our park system. 
   For the Bureau of Land Management, the bill fully funds the request for noxious weed control, fully funds the budget request for annual and deferred maintenance, and provides an increase of $7.2 million for recreation programs. The bill also provides a $10 million increase for Payments In Lieu of Taxes, continuing the committee's steady effort to raise PILT funding toward the authorized level. 
   For the Forest Service, the bill provides increases of $10.5 million for recreation programs, and provides level funding for the timber program to prevent further erosion of timber offer levels. The bill also fully funds firefighting preparedness, provides all the funds requested to address survey and manage issues under the Northwest Forest Plan, and provides increases over the President's budget request for both road and trail maintenance. 
   For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the bill provides increases of $17 million for refuge operations and maintenance to continue efforts to bolster the Service's basic operational capabilities. The bill also includes increases of $15 million for endangered species accounts, and $5 million for law enforcement programs that have been flat-funded for a number of years. 
   With respect to the cultural agencies funded in this bill, I am pleased to note that funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is increased by $7 million, and funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities is increased by $5 million. While these increases are fairly modest, they are indicative of the widespread support that these two agencies have within the Senate. The increases also reflect the degree to which the Endowments have responded to congressional concerns about the types of activities being funded, and the way in which project funding decisions are made. While last year we were not able to maintain the higher Senate funding levels in conference with the House, I fully intend to maintain the increases provided for the Endowments in the final FY 2001 bill. I will put the leadership of the other body on notice now that the Senate has no intention of receding on this matter. 
   This bill also provides funding for a portion of the Department of Energy, including programs that support research on energy conservation and fossil energy development. This research is critical to reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, and to reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, power plants and other sources. The bill provides targeted increases for the most effective of these programs. Of particular not is the $11 million increase over the request level for oil technology research and development. 
   This program, which is designed to enhance oil production from domestic sources and to develop cleaner petroleum-based fuels, was inexplicably slated for a large reduction the administration's budget request. In light of the recent and alarming rise in the price of gasoline, such a reduction seems highly imprudent at this time. The bill also provides increases for research on cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles, including additional funding for the Partnership for a Next Generation of Vehicles. This program was eliminated by the other body during floor debate--something which also seems imprudent in light of our growing dependence on foreign oil, and the potentially disastrous impact that rising oil prices could have on our economy. 
   Among the many Indian programs funded in this bill, I have already discussed the high priority that has been placed on education programs. The bill provides increases for other Indian programs, however, including an increase of $143 million for Indian Health Services. This amount includes a $41 million program increase for additional clinical services, a $20 million increase for contract health services, and a $25 million increase for facilities construction and improvement. The bill continues the committee's efforts to help the Department of the Interior reform its abysmal trust management system. As many of my colleagues are aware, the Department is making a concerted effort to deal with a trust management mess that has been building for decades, if not the entire 20th century. This bill provides the full administration request for the Office of Special Trustee, which is charged with overseeing the trust reform initiative. The bill also provides an increase of $12.5 million for trust reform activities within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   On a more parochial level, I would like also to talk about what this bill means for the people of Washington State. The land management agencies funded through the Interior Appropriations bill have a dramatic impact on the ecological and economic health of the Pacific Northwest. With more than 25 percent of the land in Washington State owned by the Federal Government, I have taken a special interest in assuring that we have the resources and policies that promote recreational and economic opportunities, and environmental preservation. 
   In preparing the FY 2001 Interior appropriations bill, I focused on three  key issues for Washington State: restoring the health of our salmon runs, providing recreational opportunities, and promoting a clean Washington State. 
   The salmon crisis has reached new heights in the past 6 months. While greeted by the good news that some returning Columbia River runs are at their highest levels in more than a decade, the cause of decline and the goals for recovery remain a mystery. The clash between local governments and the Federal agencies responsible for addressing the listing of these species has grown increasingly tense. 
   Fortunately, most can agree that homegrown efforts to recover salmon will be the foundation for addressing the species' future. In this year's Interior bill, I have continued and increased the Federal Government's investment in funding volunteer salmon recovery groups that have the best track record for identifying and restoring crucial stream and river habitat for salmon. 
   Increasingly, the role of fish hatcheries in the larger effort to restore naturally spawning runs of salmon has come under scrutiny. A group of key scientists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife have joined forces to develop standards for the more than 100 hatcheries located in the State. I have secured funding to continue this effort to redesign hatchery practices and retrofit the facilities to ultimately enhance salmon runs rather than detract from the larger recovery goals. 
   The Northwest continues to be a hot spot for recreation. Whether you are a day hiker from downtown Seattle or a back country horseman from Okanogan, all of us have a desire to preserve and enhance the recreation opportunities on our public lands. This year, I have focused my attention on improving camping and hiking opportunities in the Middle 
   Fork Snoqualmie Valley and preserving the history of Ebey's Landing on Whidbey Island. 
   Finally, the health and beauty of our public lands are assets we cannot ignore. The diversity of wildlife that resides in our forests, refuges and parks must be preserved in the future. I have dedicated funding to acquiring key tracts of land that will provide connective habitat in the Cascade Range. Our children deserve a clean Washington State, and the fiscal year 2001 Interior appropriations bill makes a strong investment in the public lands we depend on for ecological and economic stability. 
   In the interests of expediting debate on this bill, I will not spend more of the Senate's time describing its many noteworthy features. I do, however, wish to make one final observation regarding the bill as a whole. The bill will soon be open to amendment. Any Senator may offer an amendment to move funding from one program to another. Some of these proposals I may support, as I do not claim to know all there is to know about programs funded in this bill. Many such amendments I will oppose, however, because I think the bill before you represents an appropriate balance among competing priorities. But whatever the case, the point is that the process of amendment is available to us--to all Senators. 
   The administration's budget request includes a proposal that would greatly diminish the right of Senators to offer amendments to change spending priorities in this bill. The ``Lands Legacy'' initiative would fence off a significant number of the programs in this bill and provide a set amount of funding for those programs. An amendment to move funding from this Lands Legacy pot to other programs would not be possible. For instance, one could not propose to shift funds from Urban and Community Forestry to Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, or from the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund to the National Park Service operations account. Regardless of what individual Senators might think about such amendments, to prohibit the simple offering of the amendment is absurd. That is why the committee has rejected the administration proposal entirely. And that is why this Senator is vehemently opposing efforts being made elsewhere in Congress to take land acquisition and a handful of favored grant programs off budget, thereby preventing the Appropriations Committee and the Senate as a whole from weighing the merits of those programs against the other critical--but sometimes less visible or popular--activities funded in this bill. 
   On one further matter, I know several of my colleagues have inquired about emergency items that were included in the supplemental portion of the Agriculture appropriations bill, but which were not included in the supplemental title of the military construction bill that was sent to the President prior to the recess. This category includes funding for hurricane damage to National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facilities, and funding championed by Senator GRAMS that would address a major timber blowdown in Minnesota and Wisconsin. While I can not now say exactly how we will address these issues, I want to assure my colleagues that this senator is committed to seeing that these previously identified emergency needs are addressed. 
   Before I turn to Senator BYRD for his opening remarks, I want to state for the record how much I continue to enjoy working with him in putting this bill together year after year. He is a forceful and eloquent advocate for the interests of the State of West Virginia, as well as for the interests of Members on his side of the aisle and I may say, my side of the aisle. He is always cognizant, however, of the need to put forward a well balanced bill that adequately addresses the pressing national priorities that come under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. It is a great pleasure to work with him and his able staff. I also want to thank my own staff for the many hours they have put into this bill. It is often a grueling process, and I know I speak for all Senators in expressing appreciation for the work that has been done to get us this far. 
   With that, I will only add the comment that I hope we will be able to deal with this bill relatively promptly and deal with it within the parameters set by the bill itself. I think it is not nearly as controversial a proposal as sometimes has been the case in the past. The House has, of course, already passed its Interior appropriations bill, and I have every hope we can finish our task relatively promptly and send not only an acceptable but an absolutely first-rate bill to the President of the United States.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, once again, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator BYRD, not only for his kind words but substantively for the fact that I believe we have brought to the floor a bill that can command wide respect and that is not likely to be faced with profound amendments that change the direction or the philosophy of the bill itself. 
   We have put together a list of rumored amendments as well as some en bloc amendments that we can accept in closing. It is relatively modest in length. It will be good if some of them can be brought today, of course, in the course of the next less than 2 hours. But I do hope that by tomorrow we will be in a position to get a unanimous consent agreement for a finite number of amendments and can develop a way in which to deal with them very promptly. 
   The majority leader has told us how much he has to accomplish for the week. It will be a wonderful tribute to us, and a great help to us, if we are able to be in conference on this committee well before the week is over.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the emergency, the task, the unprecedented nature of the storm damage that is described by the Senator from Minnesota is absolutely correct. There is not a single thing he has said that meets with any resistance or disagreement on the part of this Senator. 
   I wish that money had been included in the bill that is now law. As I believe the Senator knows, it remains in the Agriculture appropriations bill. I guess, procedurally at least, the principal challenge or principal question is which one of these two bills is going to get to the President and actually be signed first because I know the Senator from Minnesota wishes to have this money in hand. 
   I make this suggestion to the Senator from Minnesota. If he would get together in just the next few hours or over the evening with the junior Senator from Minnesota and present us with a joint project, I will discuss the matter with Senator BYRD and with the leadership and tell the Senator that I think he is absolutely right; I want to get this job done as quickly as I possibly can. I will be delighted--and I am sure Senator BYRD will be delighted as well--to see to it that we do this in a way in which it becomes law and the money becomes available as quickly as possible.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Mexico on his presentation and I ask if he will return to the two charts. 
   I appreciate the kind words of the Senator from New Mexico on this general field. My own view is we do need to do what we can to produce more petroleum products from sources that are within the control of the United States. I am convinced we also, in meeting this challenge, need to move aggressively toward the development and increased use of alternative fuels for our automobiles. Even if we are relatively successful in both of those courses of action, the challenge of an increased dependence and increased use of fossil fuels in transportation, or of even alternative fuels, is simply going to continue to grow. 
   The Senator from New Mexico, in stressing the importance of a greater degree of efficiency in the use of energy for transportation purposes, is directly on point. As he stated, this appropriations bill includes a modest increase in its appropriation for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a program I have supported ever since I took the chairmanship of this subcommittee. I think it is very important to the country as a whole. I think it is a constructive partnership between government and the private sector. 
   I am delighted to have a Member speak on this specific element of the bill that I had to pass over rather quickly. The top line on the chart indicates the nature of the problem. 
   The Senator from New Mexico also mentioned my effort in a different appropriations bill, once again, to go back to mandated, better fuel efficiency standards on the part of automobiles and small trucks. That is at least a first cousin, if not closer, to the proposition to which the Senator from New Mexico is speaking. 
   If we are to be successful, if we are to turn that rapidly rising line in the chart and even flatten it out, it seems  to me we have to engage in all of these. The subject about which he spoke is particularly important. 
   I can assure the Senator from New Mexico that in a conference committee with the House on this subject, I will hold out as eloquently as I possibly can for the full Senate appropriation.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, in less than 10 minutes, under the previous order, the Senate will move on to another subject. We have completed opening statements on the Interior appropriations bill. The two Senators from Minnesota have offered an amendment, and we have had notice of several others. 
   This is simply to announce to my colleagues that sometime tomorrow--I hope relatively early tomorrow--we trust we will be in a position to make a unanimous consent request stating that there is a deadline for the filing of amendments. I do believe we will be able to begin to discuss actual amendments fairly promptly tomorrow morning, but as the majority leader said, in the evenings from now on, we will move to the Defense authorization bill. So Members who wish their amendments to be considered should notify both managers as promptly as possible, should file those amendments as promptly as possible, and should begin to arrange with the managers for times relatively convenient to all concerned to bring them up. 
   The majority leader would like to finish this bill tomorrow. I must say that I join him fervently in that wish, a wish that is not, however, a prediction. Nonetheless, a great deal remains to be done this week. The more promptly Members can come to the floor with their amendments and see whether or not we can deal with them informally or whether they will require a vote the better off all Members of the Senate will be. It is doubtful we will get anything more accomplished between now and 3:30, however. So at this point I will suggest the absence of a quorum and will ask that it be called off at 3:30 so we can move to the next matter of business. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in February of 1999, I awarded my first Innovation in Education Award to the Tukwila School District for their ``Friends and Family Program.'' Now, over a year later, I am standing on the Senate floor again to recognize an innovative program in this same district, the Youth Investment Program at Cascade View Elementary. As both these awards indicate, great things are coming out of the Tukwila School District and this innovative summer school program is no exception. 
   Teachers and educators at Cascade View Elementary realized that many of their students were in need of additional help to be ready for their upcoming school year. Cascade Valley wanted to take advantage of the summer months to target students who need extra help in reading, math, and writing skills. Thus, the Youth Investment Program was created. Last week, I visited with teachers and students from this program and witnessed first-hand the tremendous impact that it has on its students. 
   In classes where approximately 22-percent of the students speak English as a second language and skill levels range across the board, these teachers have produced spectacular results in their students' academic achievements and social development. 
   Michael Silver, Superintendent of the Tukwila District, says ``There is a high percentage of kids from different ethnic groups who are at different skill levels. Our program has been able to streamline their learning to catch them up for their new grade level.'' 
   The Youth Investment Program is also preparing students to succeed in the 21st century by incorporating computer training into many of the traditional academic subjects. The computer skills of each child are monitored throughout program. Teachers have also used computers to teach non-traditional courses such as drama and music which has enabled students and teachers to bring new meaning to the classroom. I am positive that these students will return to school in the fall not only equipped with renewed confidence but also with the skills and knowledge demanded by the new technology age. 
   After spending a time with the students and teachers involved in the Youth Investment Program, it was not hard for me to see why the efforts of the Tukwila School District continue to stand out among local education in Washington State. Mr. President, the Youth Investment Program demonstrates once again that our local educators know how to meet the needs of their students. I applaud the work of the staff and teachers at Cascade View and I am pleased to present my 44th Innovation in Education Award to the Youth Investment Program.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I oppose the billions of dollars of emergency Fiscal Year 2000 supplemental funding included in the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction bill to continue our involvement in Kosovo, and to dramatically escalate our military's involvement in Colombia. While I support the Military Construction provisions in the bill, particularly the worthy Washington state projects specified in the bill, I cannot vote for passage of this measure. 
   I did not support the President's decision to intervene in the 600-year-old civil war in the Republic of Yugoslavia, and do not support the spending of another $2 billion on this open-ended commitment of our nation's armed forces and taxpayer dollars. 
   Last week, I actively opposed the President's effort to entangle us in yet another civil war, this time in Colombia. I unsuccessfully sought to reduce the proposed $934 million in funding to $200 million, which would amount to a four-fold increase in spending on our fight against drug-trafficking between Colombia and the United States. This supplemental spending bill now includes even more for Colombia, a total of $1.3 billion. I am afraid this is a mere down payment on the billions more we will be asked to spend in coming years. I refuse to support this launching of yet another never-ending commitment--especially one that the President can neither justify nor guarantee will have even the slightest positive impact on drug trafficking. 
   The billions included in this bill for Kosovo and Colombia are not only an irresponsible waste of taxpayer funds, they are a dangerous gamble that we will exit involvement in these civil wars with less damage to our fighting men and women, and national dignity than we have in the past.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I urge the Senate to unanimously adopt S. 2071, my bill also known as ``the Electric Reliability 2000 Act.'' The bill consists of a striking amendment adopted in the Energy Committee and sponsored by Senators MURKOWSKI, BINGAMAN, and myself. It includes the original legislation and compromise language that addresses the concerns of the States on this issue. 
   We should be pro-active in addressing electricity reliability, and S. 2071 is the correct approach at this time. The language has been endorsed by all of the major groups associated with the electricity industry, including investor-owned utilities, public power, rural cooperatives, states groups, reliability groups, power producers, and consumer organizations. Not only does this bill provide a long-term solution to electricity reliability by creating a national reliability organization--modeled loosely on the Securities and Exchange Commission--it will give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission immediate authority to prevent blackouts this summer. 
   Enacting S. 2071 is critical for all electricity consumers in the United States. This Nation's interstate electric transmission system is an extremely complex network that connects with Canada and Mexico. It developed over decades with various voluntary agreements that allow areas to work together depending on changing power needs that vary from minute to minute. Yet a fundamental change has made this voluntary system unworkable. The system of buying and selling wholesale power is now many times more complex than it was just a decade ago. With a stronger economy, electricity usage and its importance to the economy has increased. Due to the uncertain nature of evolving retail and wholesale electricity markets, many utilities have cut investment that traditionally enhanced the reliability of the nation's grid. 
   The fact is that the voluntary agreements just do not work any longer because there is no enforcement. With the beginning of competition, we need a referee on the bulk-power system. A multitude of studies and incidents over the past several years show that the Nation's reliability is at its lowest point in decades. Certain entities can ``game'' the transmission system--with potential of causing brownouts and blackouts within a region--and suffer no consequences for such actions. With continued extreme heat predicted for this summer, the problem will continue. Blackouts hit the San Francisco area and Detroit in the past month, and even the Northwest is facing shortages this summer. 
   As I said in February when I introduced this bill, reliability is more than creating legally-enforceable rules on the electricity transmission grid. It also includes cost-effective conservation and demand-side management. Reliability will be enhanced with open-access transmission policies and with more generation distributed throughout the grid, whether it is small fuel cells or larger plants with clean technology. Sending the right signals to the investment community will be aided by passage of a truly comprehensive bill next year that allows all regions of the country--including the Northwest--the ability to benefit from a truly open and competitive marketplace. All of these factors, along with S. 2071, contribute to electricity reliability. 
   The Electric Reliability 2000 Act is not a total solution to the electricity reliability problem in this nation, but it is a solid start. Enacting this legislation will have immediate benefits for American consumers and the economy of the United States.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, in introducing legislation today that seeks to permanently authorize the recreation fee program for the federal land management agencies. Congress authorized the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in the FY 1996 Omnibus Consolidated Recissions and Appropriations Act, and has extended the program through the Interior Appropriations bill several times since 1996. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, the fees collected by the National Park Service and Forest Service have been a tremendous additional resource to provide improved campgrounds, trails, and other visitor facilities. As chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, I have consistently provided increases for operations, maintenance, and repair of park, forest, and refuge facilities. Regardless, this country's love affair with recreation and the great outdoors has begun to take its toll on the public lands we enjoy so much. 
   Since I took over the chairmanship of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I also have been faced with an unending list of federal land acquisition proposals. The demand to increase the federal government's land base cannot be considered in a vacuum, especially when we're faced with at least a $12 billion maintenance backlog on the lands we already own. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office recommended last year that the federal government place a ten-year moratorium on land acquisitions in an effort to address the backlog in maintenance projects. 
   I don't support taking such an extreme step. Rather, I believe we can have a reasonable level of land acquisitions, but we also need to commit to  finding the additional resources to maintain what we already have. I am committed to providing access to our public lands, but this can only happen if we have enough funding to maintain the land and facilities treasured by Americans and visitors from all over the world. 
   Over the past five years of the fee demonstration project, the federal agencies have tested various types of fees and collection methods in preparation for the possibility of some day establishing a long-term, consistent, and fair fee program. In general terms, the project has been a great success, providing the federal land management agencies nearly $200 million last year in additional revenue for maintenance and repair projects, and resources for improved visitor services. 
   In 1999, at the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie Forest in my state, the program allowed this Forest to clear 739.6 miles of trail, hire 22 trail maintenance workers, develop leveraged partnerships with non-profit groups to accomplish maintenance work with volunteers, and maintain 67 trailhead toilets and 136 trailheads. All of this vital work was accomplished by charging $3 for day passes or $25 for an annual pass. 
   Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Interior Appropriations bill, which extends the Recreation Demonstration Fee Program through the end of fiscal year 2002. Despite my resistance to using the Interior bill to continue this program, I felt it was vital to provide the agencies certainty for another year. In fact, recent improvements to the Forest Service fee program in the Northwest, including the new Northwest Forest Pass, would have been jeopardized without the extension. 
   With that said, I believe the Senate, through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, deserves the opportunity to fully consider legislation to permanently authorize the recreation fee program. The success stories are abundant, but by no means am I blind to the problems we've seen over the past five years. Most importantly, the public deserves the opportunity to participate, both through hearings and contact with their elected representatives, to provide us the input we need to authorize a permanent program. 
   That's why I have chosen to join Senator GRAHAM today in introducing a bill to begin the debate over how and whether Congress should permanently authorize the recreation fee program. The bill we've crafted provides the framework for a permanent program that will build upon the successes and correct the problems we've seen so far. 
   I want to stress that this bill will serve as the starting point for what I hope to be a full and deliberative discourse on recreation fees. I intend to work with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a series of hearings, including field hearings, so representatives of recreation groups, gateway communities, and other interested parties can air their concerns and suggestions. My staff and I have spent a considerable amount of time meeting and talking with recreation groups based in Washington state. I am certain there will be many ways we can improve the legislation introduced today to address their concerns through the committee process, and I am excited to continue that dialogue. 
   It goes without saying that no one really wants to pay a fee to recreate on public lands. The key to making a permanent program a success in the future will depend on keeping the fees reasonable and the results tangible. The most important component of the Recreation Fee Demonstration Project is the requirement that 80 percent of the fees remain at the site the fees are collected. The legislation introduced today maintains that requirement. In addition, Congress and the Administration must make a firm commitment to uphold its responsibility to continue to increase appropriations in the future to reduce the maintenance backlog. It's a two-way street, and we must all do our part. 
   Further, I fully expect to address other issues raised by my friends in the recreation community. Although the situation has improved recently, the multiple fee structures tested by the Forest Service created a confusing and frustrating situation for hikers and rock climbers. In particular, rock climbers have been hit with multiple fees for just one visit to the forest. Many recreationists are calling for multi-agency passes. I find this idea intriguing and would urge further discussion through the committee process. I must note, however, that multi-agency fees may distract from the expectation that fees remain at the facilities and sites where they are collected. Further, some outdoor enthusiasts are concerned the fee program could inspire over-building on our public lands to justify collection of the fees. I, too, am concerned with preserving the integrity of our public lands and avoiding the impulse to provide unnecessary facilities. This legislation directs the agencies to place a priority on deferred maintenance projects. But again, these are topics that deserve thoughtful discussion, and I look forward to addressing them in the near future. 
   Finally, many active recreationists have made a strong case for developing a recognition program that rewards volunteers for dedicating their time to improving our public lands. Many forests and parks have well-developed volunteer programs, while others do not. I am dedicated to working with recreation groups to provide the agencies appropriate guidelines in the bill to develop a consistent program that provides volunteers reduced or free access to our public lands. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for being a leader in the protection of the nation's public lands. I look forward to working with him, and the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to authorize a permanent program that provides necessary resources to maintain and improve these national treasures for generations to come.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we start from the proposition that this bill, for various education and health care and job training efforts, is dramatically larger than the bill that was passed in this body last year, to everyone's satisfaction, increasing at a rate far more rapid than the pace of inflation or population growth in the United States. 
   Obscured in the debate so far is the fact that there is some $5.4 billion in job training programs in this bill, at a time of record low unemployment. This represents an increase of more than $16 million over the bill that is currently in effect for the present year. The greater increases in the bill, of course, were for education and for biomedical research, both of which exceed the amounts requested by President Clinton. Even so, the bill provides funding for two new programs requested by the Clinton administration: Worker training and responsible reintegration of youthful offenders, each at $30 and $20 million respectively, a 22-percent increase for dislocated workers in the course of the last 4 years, and a 25-percent increase in the same period of time for the Job Corps. 
   The private sector, of course, now looking more than ever for qualified employees, has dramatically increased its own hiring and training programs. Of course, in comparison with the House bill, this rejects the $400 million cut in the House bill in that field. 
   As for summer training, the argument of the Senator from Illinois was a peculiar one. The current law for summer jobs, a law passed last fall, of course, well after last summer was over, has $1 billion in it for just exactly that purpose: $1 billion for summer jobs for youth. 
   We have another in a series of amendments that illustrates the proposition that no matter how generous this body is, even I may say in many cases no matter how generous the administration is, some Members will come to the floor and demand more, whatever its impact on the budget. 
   To quote the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board implicitly as being in favor of programs such as this is to fly in the face of logic. It is the clear position, often quoted by Members on the other side, that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board believes that the single most important means to the goal of a stronger economy we can follow is not to increase Federal spending and, in fact, to decrease it. He has consistently, over the years, held to the position that for the economy as a whole, for future job growth, the best thing we can do is be modest in our spending, not to increase it, I suspect, as much as it is increased in this bill. 
   In any event, as has been the case with previous amendments of this nature, it will simply add millions, in some cases billions, of dollars to the bill. It is subject to a point of order under the Budget Act. At the appropriate time, that budget point of order will be presented.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the rejection of the last motion to waive, I think, was a wise action on the part of the Senate. I am here primarily to congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania for the way in which he has dealt with the challenge of education in this bill. More than $40 billion for education is a very substantial increase over the current year. 
   That is more than a $1 billion increase in special education programs, at least moving us one step further toward the promise of 40-percent funding of the cost of special education to the school districts of the United States. 
   In my view, the centerpiece of this bill is in its expression of trust and confidence in our local school authorities, our parents, our teachers, our principals, our superintendents, our elected school board members, a trust and confidence expressed in a more than $3 billion appropriation for title VI, the innovative education program strategies. 
   The last amendment would have taken roughly half of that amount of money and mandated that it go solely for additional teachers in the first three grades. Title VI, as it appears in this bill, says in effect our school districts--the men and women who know our children's names--are better suited to make the decisions in 17,000 separate school districts about what can most improve the quality of education for their children. As such, we are far better off passing the bill as the Senator from Pennsylvania has written it than we would be in including more mandates in this bill. 
   There are at least two outside experts who agree with that proposition. One comes in an interesting paper by Andy Rotherham at the Progressive Policy Institute, an arm of the Democratic Leadership Council. He now, incidentally, works for President Clinton. He wrote a little bit more than a year ago:  
   President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable and essential; however, mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.  
   In my own State, the Legislative Audit and Review Committee came to this conclusion:   
   An analysis of 60 well-designed studies found that increased teacher education, teacher experience and teacher salaries all had a greater impact on student test scores per dollar spent than did lowering the student-teacher ratio. According to one researcher, ``Teachers who know a lot about teaching and learning and who work in settings that allow them to know their students well are the critical elements of successful learning.'' Given limited funds to invest, this research suggests considering efforts to improve teacher access to high quality professional development. A recent national survey of teachers found that many do not feel well prepared to face future teaching challenges, including increasing technological changes and greater diversity in the classroom. 
   The legislature's--  
   In this case, Washington--  
   approach to funding K-12 education is consistent. ..... The legislature has provided additional funding for teacher salaries, staff development, and smaller classes, with more funding going to support teachers and less for reducing the student-teacher ratio.  
   The point is that reducing class size is not a bad option. It is a good option. I think we can all agree that it is one good thing for students. It is best done, however, when the decision about whether or not to do it and how it is to be accomplished is made in local communities and not in Washington, 
   DC. 
   Even that proposal pales in comparison with the now platform of the Vice President of the United States. He calls for a massive Federal effort from recruiting to setting teaching standards in a sense that will make the Federal Government clearly a national school board. Teachers who please Washington, DC, bureaucrats will get bonuses. Those who do not do so will risk being fired. 
   The only thing bold about that initiative is that he has no qualms in taking over each and every one of the 17,000 school districts in the United States. If he becomes our President, education policy will undergo a significant shift. Local community school boards and teachers will be shut out of the process. 
   What we are doing in this bill is moving significantly in the right direction. There is little disagreement over the necessity of a significant Federal contribution to education. It is only about 7 percent of the money we have spent, but it is the persistent drive of this administration and of this Department of Education to increase to well over 50 percent the rules and regulations governing our schools that accompany that 7 percent. 
   This bill takes a dramatic step in a far better direction, a direction in which the support from the Congress is generous, but the trust of the Congress in the ability of school boards, teachers, principals, and superintendents to make decisions about our education is vastly increased all to the benefit of our children's education.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment would be to strike the Colombian drug money appropriation of $934 million and substitute for that number $200 million. In other words, the passage of the amendment would result in savings--that is to say, not spending--almost three-quarters of a billion dollars, and by implication using that money to pay down the national debt. 
   Curiously enough, I think the justification for the amendment is as eloquently stated in the bill being managed by my friend from Kentucky and by the committee report--which I commend to my colleagues--that accompanies that amendment. 
   I will read one paragraph now from the committee report:  
   Historically, INL has provided support to the Colombian National Police. The Supplemental anticipates a 7:1 shift in funding from the Police to the Army. Given the past limited role and resources provided for counter-narcotics activities in Colombia and the region, the Committee is concerned about the rapid, new, and unprecedented levels of spending requested. The fiscal year 2000 program level of $50,000,000 for Colombia will now rise to nearly $1,000,000,000. The Committee has grave reservations regarding the Administration's ability to effectively manage the use of these resources to achieve the expected results of reducing production and supply of cocaine while protecting human rights.  
   I could hardly state my case better. We have a profound and dramatic shift in focus. We have a huge 19-1 increase in the amount of money in this bill focused on this particular problem, and we lack even a clue as to whether or not it will have any positive impact on  drug trafficking between Colombia and the United States. 
   I will read the language found on page 151 of the bill, section 6106:

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the capacity of this body for self-delusion seems to this Senator to be unlimited. Time after time, we permit this administration to involve us in some new armed conflict without seriously examining the consequences of that involvement, the cost of the involvement, the length of the involvement, or even the possibility that we will attain the goals of that involvement. 
   Mark my words, we are on the verge of doing exactly the same thing here that we have done so frequently in the last 7 or 8 years. This bill includes almost $1 billion for an entirely new, and almost totally military, involvement in a civil war in Latin America, without the slightest promise that our intervention will be a success, and it does it in a totally backward fashion. 
   The very committee report that recommends spending this almost $1 billion says that the committee ``has grave reservations regarding the administration's ability to effectively manage the use of these resources to achieve the expected results.'' 
   Well, if we have grave reservations, why are we doing it before those reservations have been met? 
   The bill is a paradox. It says to the administration, spend $934 million, and then come to us and tell us what you have done and why it should go on. But if Kosovo and Bosnia are any indication, when the administration comes back next year, the answer will be: Well, we are already in it; we can't quit now. 
   That is what we have been told for 6 or 7 years in Bosnia and 2 or 3 in Kosovo, with no end in sight. And there will be no end in sight here either, Mr. President. This bill says let's get in a war now and justify it later. My amendment says let's hear the justification first; let's seriously consider what we are getting into and then maybe vote the money. 
   This amendment takes $700 million of the $934 million and says, for now, let's pay down the debt with it. Let's expand our present help to Colombia and its police forces, rather substantially, but let's not get into a new armed conflict until we have far greater justification than we have received to this point. 
   It just seems impossible to me to believe that in the absence of the debate of the whole country, with all of the lessons we must have learned not just in this administration, but in previous administrations, about how easy it is to get in and how hard it is to get out, we will blithely make this downpayment--and this is a downpayment only. Next year, maybe we will need a lot more money if they are not doing very well down there. And how much of the equipment is going to end up in the hands of rebels by sale or capture or otherwise? We have no way of controlling that without a presence on the ground. 
   I urge this body to say to the administration: No, we are not going to do this until you first come to us with a formal overall plan with a beginning, middle, and an end, and a plan for how we are going to achieve our goals. Get the authority first and then fund it. It is 10 times better for this society to put that $700 million on our debt and not get in a civil war in South America. That is what this debate is all about--not that we don't like the Colombians or that we don't want them to be successful, but we don't want a part of their war.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to talk to you today about the Career and Technical Education Program in Walla Walla, Washington. Students in this program are learning skills that are highly important in the working world and will give them a leg up on the competition as they enter the workforce. This program has made a tremendous impact on the school's learning environment and also gives students an incentive to stay in school. 
   Fifteen years ago, the faculty at Walla Walla High School wanted to create a program in which students would gain practical knowledge to supplement what is learned in the traditional classroom setting. The Career and Technical Education Program, created with the help of grant money, gives students the opportunity to gain technical skills along with the school's curriculum. 
   For example, students enrolled in anatomy or physiology class can put their knowledge to work by taking Sports Medicine where they learn about treating sports injuries, CPR and other first aid skills. In addition, technology labs have been interwoven into the curriculum to teach robotics, flight simulation, and bridge analysis to enhance math and physics classes. Through this programs, students can see a direct link between their work in the classroom to a potential job. 
   Gerald Cummins, Director of Career and Technical Education, says the Career and Technical Education Program has drastically improved the college bound population in Walla Walla over the last fifteen years. ``Fifteen years ago, there were barely any kids continuing on to the college level. Now most kids are achieving college credits through our program before even being accepted into college.'' 
   The faculty at Walla Walla High School also has established strong communication between parents, the school and community members, giving students a sense of support that will encourage them to continue in their academic pursuits. 
   Much credit should be given to the vision of the Walla Walla School Board and staff who have worked to ensure high standards of teaching. They have found new ways to improve upon their curriculum and provided excellent opportunities for each student to expand his or her horizons.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   Yesterday, both Senator BRYAN and I came to the floor to discuss this motion, the reasons for dealing with corporate average fuel economy standards in this fashion, and to give a preview as to our reasons for this vitally important motion. 
   Twenty-five years ago, in 1975, the Congress--an enlightened Congress, I may say--passed a certain set of requirements demanding that automobiles and small trucks on average from each manufacturer meet certain fuel efficiency standards; that is to say, that they get better gas mileage and, not at all incidentally, provide less pollution into the atmosphere of the United States. 
   That statute was passed, of course, in the aftermath of the oil boycott on the part of Arab countries and a steep rise in gasoline prices. 
   Though I am quite conservative and often critical of government regulation, I know of few, if any, regulatory regimes of the United States that were more successful. In a period of a little more than 5 years, the average fuel efficiency of automobiles in the United States for all practical purposes doubled. That proposal was passed, incidentally, over arguments that were not similar to the arguments that are made against this motion today but identical to the arguments made against this motion today. 
   We were told by the Ford Motor Company that the passage of such standards would mean everyone would be driving a Maverick or something smaller than a Maverick. Chrysler and General Motors followed suit. The people of the United States would not be able to buy the kinds of automobiles they were accustomed to driving and those that they were in fact driving at the present time. 
   Well, those predictions were so dramatically off kilter that the largest regular passenger cars manufactured today get better gas mileage than the Maverick about which they were speaking in the year 1975. 
   Curiously enough, however, in spite of this huge success, a success that literally saves 3 million gallons of gasoline a day in the United States, for at least the last 10 years, the House of Representatives, in its appropriation bill for the Department of Transportation, has prohibited not only the promulgation of new corporate average fuel economy standards but even their study and proposal on the part of the Department of Transportation. 
   The Senate, in each of those years, has been wiser. It has included no such prohibition. Regrettably, however, the Senate has without exception receded to the House position on this issue in each and every year of the last decade or two. As a consequence, the average fuel economy of our overall fleets has been decreasing rather than increasing. 
   Last year, the distinguished Senator from California, Mr. BRYAN from Nevada, and I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that we should not keep our heads in the sand any longer; We ought to allow these studies to go forward. We ended up with roughly 40 votes, a substantial and credible vote, but obviously not a majority vote of the Senate. What has happened during the course of the last year, Mr. President? Well, the most obvious occurrence has been a vast increase in the retail price of gasoline for each and every American consumer. 
   A year ago, we were at the end of roughly a year of abnormally low gasoline prices. The reaction earlier this year on the part of OPEC was to get that cartel together, cut back on production, and thus hugely drive up the price of gasoline. Our Secretary of Energy was sent, hat in hand, around the world to plead with OPEC countries to please produce more gasoline, please don't punish Americans by driving up retail gasoline prices so high. This is what we in the United States were reduced to--pleading with OPEC countries for a greater degree of production. 
   Well, they agreed to a little bit more. Prices dropped for a month or so, although nothing comparable to the increase that had preceded it. Now they are on the rise again. I believe it was Monday that the Washington Post indicated that retail prices for gasoline in the Midwest, where there are certain air pollution requirements, have gone up 30 to 50 cents a gallon in the course of 6 or 8 weeks. The same report indicated that we had 3 straight weeks of gasoline price increases all over the country, to the point where they are higher than ever before. Predictions are that they will hit $2 a gallon well before this year is over. Perhaps even more significant than this punishment of the American people with higher gasoline prices is the increased dependence the U.S. has on foreign sources of oil. Way more than 50 percent of our oil is produced overseas now, which, of course, subjects us to the effectiveness of the OPEC cartel. 
   That is the first thing that has taken place. The second thing is this: We were accused last year in the debate with mandating new corporate efficiency standards when we didn't know what they would be, and when they  would ignore completely the safety of automobiles that were produced and driven in the U.S. Curiously enough, that, too, was a major argument made 25 years ago: More people will be killed on the highways because we will be driving these tiny little Mavericks and subcompact automobiles. 
   But do you know what has happened? Death rates on our highways, per hundred million miles driven, have dropped by more than 50 percent. Why? Because the big three automobile manufacturers' technology and imagination is far more efficient than their lobbying and the points they make during the course of political campaigns. They have made automobiles safer both because there has been a demand and because there have been mandated requirements through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for airbags, side impact matters, and a wide range of other safety devices. It is far safer to drive with the cars that we have today, which are twice as fuel efficient as those in the mid-1970s, than it was before these standards were adopted. 
   Nevertheless, it is our view that safety is an appropriate consideration. So you have a different proposition before you this year than you had last year. All we are asking--so it is a very important request in this motion--is that the Senate not agree to a House prohibition that says you cannot study, propose, or promulgate new corporate average fuel-efficient standards for automobiles. To say that we can't study that in light of the technological changes in the last 20 years--it is incredible that anybody in the Senate would argue for such a proposition. No study? No proposal? No knowledge about what we are doing? 
   I will be one of the conferees that will be appointed as soon as this debate is over and this voice vote is taken. Mr. President, because the House, of course, will maintain its position, my view is that not only an appropriate compromise but an appropriate course of action will be to permit the Department of Transportation study and propose new corporate average fuel efficiency standards. I think they ought to be studied. I think they ought to be proposed. I think they ought to consider safety as well as fuel efficiency. But I do think it quite appropriate that they be brought back here to this body into the House of Representatives before they be promulgated. 
   So I will accept as a compromise with the House a prohibition against promulgating new standards until next year's Transportation appropriations bill has been deliberated, passed, and signed, obviously by a new President of the United States. 
   We will not be running the risk of a runaway Federal agency by any stretch of the imagination. What risks will we be running? We will run the risk that we will vote on something we understand. We will run the risk that standards will be proposed that will increase the efficiency of our automobiles and lower the cost of gasoline for every American purchaser of a new car and help clean up our air--important considerations that are specific in nature and brought to us because they cannot be promulgated until we have had another chance to vote on them. I think it takes a great deal of imagination to say the United States of America, through its Department of Transportation, cannot engage in such a study and such a proposal. 
   The arguments you will get on the other side you already have in a Dear Colleague letter, one that says, gee, we made our cars more efficient in 1975, and now we drive more. I don't think that is a criticism. I think that is a praise of better gas mileage. Of course, oil consumption has increased in 25 years. We have more people. We have better roads. And we have better automobiles. It may very well be that will be the case, if we have even better gas mileage. But to say we ought to cause people to stop driving because gasoline is too expensive and we are not going to do anything about it is, at the very best, a bizarre argument. 
   The second is, of course, the very argument that there will no longer will be any choice--that cars will have to be so small that people won't be able to choose small trucks or SUVs. The Ford Motor Company has already told us it can greatly increase the fuel efficiency of SUVs. We know they can do this in the future, as they have in the past. I repeat that it is perfectly appropriate to say we will bring these standards back here to us with their actual impact before we actually pose them. 
   Finally, they argue that we are doing so well already with creating more efficient cars that we shouldn't undercut that kind of research going into a new generation of engine by having some kind of mandate. True. We have. In fact, I chaired another appropriations subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Interior, which finances the studies for a new generation of vehicles. I do so with great enthusiasm. But I also note that while these studies have gone on, the automobile manufacturers have done nothing to actually increase their average fuel economy on the road. 
   This proposal is not only not inconsistent with the studies that are going on with the cooperation of the Federal Government and the automobile manufacturers, but they are totally consistent with them. We are saying: Do a better job for Americans. Don't tell us that we will see future Secretaries of Energy every time the OPEC countries are moved to demand more money going hat in hand around the world. Use American technological genius to do the job that you did from 1975 until 1980. Produce a more efficient automobile. Don't make it less safe, make it more safe; the way you did then. 
   To use the old expression, if you fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. They attempted to fool our predecessors in 1975. They didn't succeed. They were wrong in every single argument they made in 1975. If we let them fool us twice with the same arguments, shame on us.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have only a relatively short period of time left. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, is coming to speak on our side of this issue, so I will make only one or two points briefly. 
   I listened with great interest to each of the opponents to my motion. It seems to me, as was the case a year ago, that they emphasized overwhelmingly the impact of new fuel efficiency standards on automobile safety. In fact, those arguments would have been entirely persuasive if this were a proposal requiring lighter automobiles and small trucks. It, of course, is not. It is a proposal to allow a study of whether or not corporate fuel economy standards should be increased. 
   My view, and that of my distinguished colleagues from California and Nevada, is that this can be accomplished without downsizing automobiles or small trucks. 
   Interestingly enough, many of the comments on the part of the opponents to our motion in effect said so, that great technical strides have been made in this connection, strides that we encourage. 
   But I simply want to make it clear that the goal of the proponents of this motion is to end the prohibition against even studying whether or not we should improve these fuel efficiency standards. To that end, there have been very serious negotiations in the course of the last hour or so among members of the contending parties, and it is at least possible we will be able to reach an agreement that will be approved on the part of all of those who have debated this issue here today. 
   I have every hope that that is the case because it will allow us to go forward with studies but will see to it that Congress plays the significant role--that it is playing right here today--in being permitted or required to take action before any new fuel efficiency standards become the law of the land. 
   With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, essentially we have had a debate over the refusal to allow anybody in the Transportation appropriations bill to be used to study, propose, or promulgate new corporate average fuel economy standards. The proponents of the original instruction have stated they did not wish for the Department of Transportation to be authorized to promulgate any such new rules without the consent of Congress or without another vote in Congress but that they felt it inappropriate to prevent studying what technology now permits us to do with respect to such standards. 
   This revision simply allows the House provision to go into effect with respect to the old 1975 law. However, it also tells the conferees to authorize a study by the National Academy of Sciences in conjunction with the Department of Transportation that by July 1 of next year will recommend but will not promulgate, without approval by a joint resolution of Congress, appropriate corporate average fuel economy standards. 
   It also expressly states that they shall consider safety--which was a major part of the debate here--and the impact on the automobile and manufacturing business in the United States. 
   It will last only, of course, for the fiscal year 2001 because this is an appropriations bill, but we hope by that time we will have something that we can debate that will be real in nature rather than just theoretical. 
   I ask unanimous consent my motion be considered a motion for me, for my distinguished colleague from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN; the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN; and the three Members who have debated against this, both Senators from Michigan, and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT.

I know he wished my assurance and the assurance of the people on the other side, Senator LEVIN, that it is our intention, and we will make that clear in any final conference committee report that this is a 1-fiscal-year provision only and that the entire provision expires at the end of fiscal year 2001.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Michigan asked we use ``recommend'' rather than ``proposed.'' I think it is a distinction without a difference. The operative language here is nothing can go into effect unless Congress has approved it. Whether it comes in the form of a recommendation from the Department of Transportation or proposal from the Department of Transportation, Congress has to approve it.

   Mr. GORTON. In one minor respect, the senior Senator from Michigan is in error. My own handwritten first draft said ``proposed.'' I simply acceded to the recommendation of the Senator from Michigan that we use the word ``recommend.'' 
   Clearly, what we are speaking about is the promulgation of a rule, and nothing can be promulgated by the Department of Transportation without approval of a joint resolution of Congress. So whether it recommends or proposes, they are going to have to come here before any rule takes place. 
   In connection with my earlier answer, all of these bars are off in a year. We will be right back here next year, I hope maybe not debating the same issue. I hope we may have been able to reach a conclusion on it. 
   Finally, the point of all these words, what we are now doing is instructing our conferees to a conference with the House of Representatives, and it is the words and the requirement that come out of that conference committee, of course, that will govern actual future action. 
   My intention as a member of that conference committee, and perhaps the only one in this colloquy who is a member of that conference committee, will be to see to it that we have a very 
   thorough study of this subject. I hope, like my colleagues from Michigan, that it will recommend stronger corporate average fuel economy standards, but I am willing to listen to the experts in that connection. If it does, I will support them in this body, but if something else happens, we will be debating this issue again next year. The law that applies to corporate average fuel economy standards today will apply when this fiscal year is over once again, and the same kind of rulemaking will take place then. 
   I hope I have not spoken too long on this subject, but I think we ought to get on with it now and do the job that needs to be done.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, each and every one of my colleagues has received a letter signed by this Senator and by Senators BRYAN and FEINSTEIN on the subject of CAFE standards--that is to say, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards--relating to gas mileage of automobiles. 
   In that Dear Colleague letter, we indicated there would be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on that subject that would come before the Senate during the course of the debate on this Transportation appropriations bill. The reason we had adopted that course of action, identical to the course of action we took last year, is that the Senate bill itself has no reference, one way or another, to automobile and small truck fuel economy. The House bill, however--as it has for at least 10 consecutive years--prohibits the use of any funds appropriated in this bill for even the study of increasing the mandated fuel economy of automobiles and small trucks in the United States. 
   As a consequence, it seemed to us the only way we could get at this subject, and perhaps reverse that very head-in-the-sand policy that has plagued us for so long, was somehow or another to express the views of the Senate on the subject. 
   A year ago, 40 Senators voted with us, if my memory serves me correctly; 57 voted against us. 
   This year, however, the situation on appropriations bills has changed. It has changed effectively by the readoption of rule XVI and the extension of rule XVI, not only to substantive amendments but to sense-of-the-Senate amendments as well. As a consequence, we now need to notify our colleagues we will deal with this question in a different fashion. 
   The proponents of better fuel economy standards have not yet met formally to discuss our various alternatives, but in my view they are basically two in nature. Technically, what is before us at this point is the House bill, including the prohibition against spending any money on Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, with an amendment that strikes everything after the enacting clause and substitutes the Senate-reported bill for the House bill. 
   So at this point, an amendment is in order to strike that funding prohibition in the House bill, which will give us a direct vote on the issue, though that House provision, together with every other House provision, will eventually be stricken in any event by the adoption of the Senate amendment. 
   Our other option is to wait until the end of the debate, wait until final passage of the Transportation appropriations bill, and make a motion to instruct the Senate conferees to uphold the Senate position, something the Senate conferees have notoriously failed to do during the course of the last decade. 
   I am inclined to favor that latter course of action, but the group has not yet made its decision. But we do wish all of our colleagues to know we are not going to be engaged in any procedural legerdemain by any stretch of the imagination. We will be debating this issue. We regard the issue as vitally important. 
   Perhaps most significantly, I should like to say the ground of the debate may be somewhat different from the debate a year ago, for several reasons--at least three in number. The first of those reasons is we were still living as a country in a fool's paradise a year ago, 
   a fool's paradise of abnormally low retail prices for gasoline. During the course of the last 12 months, of course, we have been subjected to a huge runup in gasoline prices motivated almost entirely by the reanimation of OPEC and its throttling back on petroleum production among its various members. 
   This left us earlier this year with what I considered to be the humiliating spectacle of a Secretary of Energy traveling from one OPEC country to another, hat in hand, asking those OPEC countries: Please, please, please, resume higher production of your product and, thus, lower those product prices. 
   The point was that we had no bargaining ability as the United States of America whatsoever to accomplish that goal, and while there was a brief respite, though nothing like a return to the original status quo in gasoline prices, we now know they are, once again, very much on the rise: increases of 30 to 50 cents a gallon in many places in the Midwest that have special air pollution requirements, the highest prices reported yesterday in the Washington Post, perhaps forever. 
   We can look forward with apprehension but with a real expectation of regular gasoline prices hitting $2 a gallon in the relatively near future. I cannot possibly emphasize enough the fact that this is a pricing structure that is simply beyond our control because we have allowed ourselves to become so dependent on foreign oil. The largest single percentage of our trade deficit, which is itself alarmingly high, is due to the importation of foreign oil. We have three possible answers to that question: We must either increase domestic production, encourage to an even greater extent than we do the use of alternative fuels, or to use the fuels we have more efficiently and more effectively. The latter not only has a very positive impact on the cost of gasoline to every consumer in the United States but also will, in a very significant fashion, help clean up our air. We will bring this subject up once again. 
   Second is the proposition that last year we were told--I am not sure entirely accurately--the law under which fuel economy was mandated did not allow the Department of Transportation to consider the safety of vehicles that would be designed to meet these standards. 
   It is our explicit intention this year, whatever the validity of that argument, to allow the Department of Transportation, in fixing new corporate average fuel economy standards, to consider factors of safety. That was a major argument a quarter of a century ago against the original CAFE standards. We were told everyone would be driving a subcompact and death rates would go up markedly. We  are not driving subcompacts. Our highways are far safer than they were 25 years ago, and will be, again, I am convinced, if we once again significantly increase our mandated fuel economy. In any event, we are explicitly allowing that consideration. 
   Third, whether one is on this side of the political aisle or the other side of the political aisle, it is obvious this process will not be completed during the course of this administration. It will be another administration, whether a Democratic or a Republican administration, that will make that final decision, and the final decision will, for all practical purposes, be subject to the same kind of prohibition that has prevented the study of corporate average fuel economy for the last two and a half decades. 
   This is a vitally important matter. I commend Chairman SHELBY and Chairman STEVENS, once again, for not including any 
   such prohibition in the Senate bill. This time we want the prohibition stricken from the final package, as well as not being included in the Senate bill itself. It seems to me to be paradoxical and foolish that the United States of America should consistently say, in spite of our magnificent technologies, in spite of the huge advances in technologies in the last couple of decades, that this is a subject we will not even study. And that, in effect, is what the present law requires of us. 
   It makes Luddites of us. It says we are afraid of such a study. It is perfectly acceptable to increase our dependence on petroleum products each and every year; that in spite of the technology, we are going to be as ostriches with our heads in the sand and not go forward at all. 
   I believe that to be an indefensible position, but as I say, this is just simply both the invitation to join us in this cause and a statement that there will be a vote on this issue. Whether in the form of an amendment to the House bill or in the form of instructions to the conferees is not yet certain. 
   There will be plenty of additional time to debate this issue, and debate it we will and vote on it we will. I am confident of a greater number of votes this year, for the reasons I have already outlined, than was the case last year. I hope my colleagues will join me in saying the United States will, once again, lead not only in abstract technology but in applied technology, and begin at least not only to clean up our air but to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and save money for our constituents every single day of their lives in which they drive automobiles and trucks. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the citizens of eastern Washington will experience a rare occurrence this week: AL GORE will visit there for the first time since he was re-elected Vice President almost 4 years ago. I welcome him to that beautiful part of Washington, and hope that he takes the opportunity to listen to the concerns of as many people as he can. 
   If he had come a week earlier, he could have joined me at any or all of the seven stops I made in eastern Washington, so that he could hear about the primary concern of citizens--the proposed removal of dams by the Clinton/Gore administration. On the other hand, knowing how eastern Washington citizens feel about hydroelectric dams, it is not a surprise that he would choose to stay away. 
   But let me urge the citizens of eastern Washington to take a good look around this week, because they will be getting a preview of what life would be like under a Gore administration. Just as in the Clinton/Gore administration, they would have a President and an administration who believe that the Federal Government knows better than local citizens do how to manage their eastern Washington way of life. 
   They would have an administration and a President who appears more interested in politics and his own election than what is necessary to save salmon or which energy source is the cleanest and most efficient for Washington citizens. 
   Consider the following dubious challenge that eastern Washington citizens face in this administration: 
   Next week, the Clinton/Gore administration will enact its 4(d) rules under the Endangered Species Act. Under the rules, the National Marine Fisheries Service will have the right to regulate the ``daily behavior'' of Washington citizens, including how much energy they consume, how far they travel, and how they maintain their gardens. Earlier this year, the administration ignored eastern Washington's request for more public hearings on the subject and more time to gain a better understanding of the vast impact the rules will have on their lives. 
   Later this summer, the administration will seek to implement the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project over the strong opposition of many citizens of eastern Washington. 
   Tomorrow, AL GORE will announce that 200,000 acres on the Hanford site will be set aside as a national monument by Presidential fiat. No one disagrees that the Hanford Reach must be protected. It is a magnificent part of the state that deserves preservation for generations to come. Of course, it is not now under threat and no emergency requires presidential action without consulting those who live around the reach. So, as decisions are made on how to protect the Hanford Reach, local consensus should be a vital component in reaching those decisions. 
   I have always advocated collaboration with and listening to all of the stakeholders to achieve a just solution. The Clinton/Gore approach is but one more example of Washington, D.C. deciding for Washington communities something I believe that they are fully capable of deciding for themselves. 
   The fact that GORE will tell local people what the Federal Government intends to do on the Hanford site rather than listen is a preview of how a Gore administration will deal with local citizens on a whole host of issues in the future. 
   The issue of the Snake River dams, however, is another matter. I expect that while AL GORE is in eastern Washington, much as with his previous visits to Seattle and Portland, he will refuse honestly to reveal his position about whether he believes tearing down the 
   Snake River dams is necessary to save salmon. 
   Equivocating on an issue that will affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, cost billions of dollars, and have minimal if any impact on salmon is flat out wrong. Last month, the only thing new that GORE told reporters in Portland about his position on dams is that the issue requires more study and that ``he refuses to prejudge or play politics'' with the issue. Well, if he's not playing politics with the issue, then I'm the inventor of the Internet. 
   After all, last fall the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, using science from the National Marine Fisheries Service, released a report stating that more than 90 percent of adult salmon survive through all four of the Snake River dams--the very dams that the administration has proposed to take out. 
   The Corps of Engineers was prepared to recommend, rightfully, that the costs are too high, that the benefits are too few, and that the dams should be left in place. But high-ranking officials within the Clinton-Gore administration directed the Corps' recommendation be suppressed.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, Senators FEINGOLD, HUTCHINSON, ABRAHAM, and LIEBERMAN, to introduce a resolution congratulating the people of Croatia on their successful parliamentary and presidential elections, the peaceful transition of power, and new initiatives for reform. In addition to congratulating the people of Croatia, the resolution solidifies U.S. support for their progress and encourages Croatian participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace program. One day, I hope that we will be expressing our support for Croatia, and other nations with similar democratic inclination, in NATO itself. 
   Mr. President, the Balkan nations that are embracing democracy must be supported at every opportunity available because the government could so easily have taken the other path. The leaders of Croatia could have chosen to repress popular involvement and other fundamental rights of democracy, but instead they have chosen the harder but correct path of working through discourse, debate, and democracy. Because we have also been through these trials as a nation, it is my hope that the American people will watch closely the progress of the Croatian people and will support their path to freedom, stability, and peace. 
   The most important benefit to come out of this election will hopefully be the resolution of Croatia's domestic difficulties. Through the successful election, the Croatian people have taken the reins of control. In addition to the power instilled by this self-determination, the Croatian people are hopefully now spurred to take up the mission of reform that might further improve their government. Among the stated goals of President Mesic are the reintroduction of Serbian refugees to the homes they left behind, reform of the privatization system that has faced serious corruption allegations, and support for the International Criminal  Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. These improvements would certainly go far to legitimize the new Administration in the view of the international community but more importantly, in the eyes of the Croatian people. President Mesic's continued efforts on these fronts will show its people that their new government takes seriously the need for honesty and accountability. 
   As the government wins the support of its people, I am also encouraged by the efforts of the new Administration to get involved with the European community. In such a volatile region, a nation uniting the many groups will be the key to fostering a stable political and economic atmosphere. Part of the victory of democracy in Croatia has been the new spirit of regional harmony that I hope will spread to its neighbors. Peace in the Balkan nations will only come with honest attempts to live with difference, and Croatia will be a leader in the efforts for peace there. 
   In addition to better conditions in the Balkans, democracy will encourage the involvement of other foreign nations. Just two weeks ago, Croatian President Stipe Mesic met with French President Jacques Chirac to discuss an agreement on stabilization and association, as well as the Croatian entrance to the NATO Partnership for Peace program. The resolution I am supporting today suggests U.S. support for the addition of Croatia in the partnership, and I am happy to inform my colleagues that the nations of NATO have announced that Croatia will become a full member of the Partnership for Peace program today. This is truly a great accomplishment, and it affirms the commitment of all NATO allies to help Croatia in its chosen path. 
   In addition to my appreciation for the democratic and international progress of the Croatian people, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the work of the Croatian American Association in bringing this subject to my attention and to the attention of the American people. The Croatian American community has worked tirelessly to create bonds of friendship between our two nations, and I hope that as Croatia becomes more democratic and involved in worldwide political affairs that we, as Americans, will continue to support them. 
   Mr. President, I hope that this resolution will be an additional bond between two nations that democratic tenets have already joined.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we know the Medicare program has not kept pace with advances in medical care and changing technology, whether through access to new medical devices or to prescription drugs. Sometimes seniors do not have access to the most advanced care. That needs to change. Some issues, like adding a prescription drug benefit, required broad reform of the program and an influx of new money to pay for the changes. But there are some common sense changes that can be made today could enhance access to life-saving therapies for seniors, particularly those living in rural areas, and potentially save Medicare dollars. 
   Medicare covers drugs that are administered in the hospital or in a physician's office but will not cover self-injectable drugs or biologics to treat the same disease, notwithstanding the fact that the latter may be superior in terms of efficacy and safety and less expensive. This outdated policy creates a perverse incentive for drug companies to develop drugs that can only be administered by I.V. in a hospital or other acute setting. Those companies that ignore Medicare's coverage policy and develop their products so that they are patient-friendly are penalized, as are the patients who need these products. The end result is often higher costs to the Medicare program, lack of beneficiary access to the best therapies, and treatment delivery problems for beneficiaries in rural areas who may not be in a position to travel to a hospital to receive regular treatments. 
   Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are particularly victimized by this coverage policy. RA is a devastating chronic disease. As the disease progresses, sufferers move from self-sufficiency to total disability. The pain in most cases is excruciating. Like all patients with a chronic disease, RA patients face extraordinary out of pocket costs. However, Medicare beneficiaries with RA face a unique set of costs. 
   One of the most promising breakthroughs for the treatment of RA is a self-injected biologic developed through recombinant DNA technology. It already has been proven to prevent and reverse disability caused by RA, as well as dramatically reduce pain and avoid costly surgery. For many RA sufferers with private insurance or on Medicaid, it has meant the difference between being confined to a wheelchair and walking--and even returning to the workforce! 
   Since it is self-injected, it is not covered by Medicare. Yet, Medicare will cover another therapy which happens to be delivered intravenously, simply because it is administered (via I.V.) in a hospital. In doing so, Medicare ends  up spending more money when one factors in the costs of services and ancillary drugs associated with administration of this covered therapy. Just as important, the current policy denies beneficiaries access to a therapy that has been proven to be more effective, less toxic, and much easier to administer. This anomaly in Medicare's existing drug coverage policy is rooted in 1960's medicine, before the advent of biotechnology and the development of patient-friendly therapies. 
   Fortunately, there is a simple, budget-neutral way to help seniors who are dependent on Medicare. The Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2000, which I will introduce today, along with Senators MURRAY, MIKULSKI, SANTORUM, CHAFEE, and COCHRAN would change Medicare's current drug coverage policy to allow coverage for self-injected biologics that are prescribed in lieu of an intravenous or physician-administered therapy. It would provide individuals suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, and deep vein thrombosis access to the latest, most promising biotechnology therapies. 
   This is a modest, common sense change that can and should be accomplished this year regardless of what may happen on comprehensive Medicare reform. If we do enact a Medicare drug benefit this year, this bill should be a part of that. Failure to do so would institutionalize a coverage gap that denies seniors access to breakthrough technology and the best care our medical system provides to everyone else with private health coverage. 
   According to a budget impact analysis by the Lewin Group, this legislation would not cost the Medicare program money and actually could save approximately $2 million per year. This is a compassionate, common-sense improvement we can make this year to improve the Medicare program for seniors. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the confirmation today of Richard Tallman to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In an unusual, if not unprecedented arrangement, particularly at this time and for the controversial Ninth Circuit, the White House, Senator MURRAY, and I have worked together quietly to select and confirm absolutely first rate judges from Washington State. Dick Tallman is no exception. 
   I had not met Mr. Tallman before he was chosen as a finalist for a district court vacancy by a Judicial Merit Selection Committee jointly appointed by Senator MURRAY and me. He impressed me tremendously at the time and I was privileged to be able later to recommend him to fill a vacancy on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Mr. Tallman enjoys broad bi-partisan support within Washington's legal community, including that of the Democratic State Attorney General, two former United States Attorneys for Western Washington, the Federal Public Defender from Western Washington, the President of the Ninth Circuit District Judges Association, and the Federal Bar Association for the Western District of Washington. 
   Prior to starting his own small firm where he continues to specialize in white collar criminal defense, Mr. Tallman practiced law for many years at one of the largest private firms in Seattle, Bogle & Gates. Before that he served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington. He has also been sought out by all levels of state government, serving as a Special Assistant City Attorney for Seattle, a Special Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for King County, as well as a Special Assistant Attorney General for Washington State. Over the years, Mr. Tallman has taught and lectured extensively to groups of lawyers and non-lawyers on a range of legal topics, instructing groups including the National Park Service, the Washington Medical Association, and the Seattle Police Academy. 
   Mr. Tallman's involvement in bar and civic activities is no less impressive than his professional record. In addition to extensive pro bono work, he has served as president of the local federal bar association and as chair of the lawyer delegates to the Ninth Circuit  Judicial Conference. He has been active in committees for local, state, and federal bar associations, in the selection of judges, bench-bar relations, and in helping women and minorities interested in legal careers. 
   As the accomplishments I have just reviewed attest, Mr. Tallman is an impressive man. What these accomplishments to not convey, however, is the warmth, good humor, and the clear unpretentious intelligence I have observed in my short acquaintance with him. The Ninth Circuit will clearly benefit from our action today.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the students at Kent Elementary School have witnessed many innovative changes thanks to the hard work and foresight of their principal, Dr. Pat Johnson. For the last nine years, Dr. Johnson has been called a strong and supportive leader by her colleagues and never ceases to make the mark of excellence high for her staff and students. I applaud Dr. Johnson's work in transforming an at-risk school into one of excellence. 
   Kent Elementary School serves a low income and highly transient population, yet Dr. Johnson believes in the abilities of all students, preaching her motto that ``Together Everyone Achieves More'' (TEAM). Though many students face challenges both at home and in the classroom, Dr. Johnson uses her positive attitude to inspire her staff toward maintaining an environment that promotes student learning. 
   One example of Johnson's commitment to enhancing student achievement was by creating a school-wide discipline program. Through this program, discipline problems have dramatically decreased on the playground and in the classroom. Dr. Johnson also believes in reinforcing positive social skills to the children through rewards and student recognition. All of the staff members share in this ``Positive Action'' program, making teamwork a priority for the children. 
   Dr. JOHNSON has also implemented block scheduling to maximize student learning. In order to better target students' math and reading skills, students attend specifically assigned classes that fit their appropriate learning levels, giving children the opportunity to move to other classrooms as their needs and skill levels improve throughout the year. 
   Student reading levels have also improved because of Dr. Johnson's Reading Mastery program which focuses on strategies that help students reach academic success. Johnson's impact on her students is also evident in Kent Elementary's 1998 Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) writing scores which were the highest scores in the Kent School District. 
   Another challenge taken on by Principal Johnson was giving students a sense of stability in their lives by creating a ``multi-age format'' in each classroom. This system allows students to have the same home-room teacher for two years and lowers the student/teacher ratio.  
   Clearly Dr. Johnson is a tremendous leader who works to enrich her students' lives. She has established many new ways to improve student learning and continues to inspire her staff and students to conquer new challenges. Clearly Dr. Johnson is an influential principal who is making local education in Washington State even stronger.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on March 23, 1999, I voted against the initial Senate resolution to authorize air attacks in Yugoslavia. More than 420 days have passed since I cast that vote, and I could not be more confident in my initial decision. 
   I argued in 1999 that the United States was foolishly injecting and engaging the brave men and women of our Armed Forces into a civil war that I dare say may never be resolved. Furthermore, the Administration had then not proposed, and to date has not yet recommended an exit strategy for the occupation of Kosovo. In reaching my decision, I questioned the mission's objectives, the implication of a long-term U.S. commitment in Yugoslavia, and most importantly I argued that our vital national interests did not warrant a full scale war in the Balkans. 
   In less than two months after the Administration was authorized to enter the war in the Balkans, Congress faced an $11 billion taxpayer commitment to the endeavor. Once again I voted against the U.S. commitment to the civil war in Kosovo, citing the same concerns. 
   And what has resulted from the U.S. and NATO engagement in Kosovo? NATO's thrust into the Balkans has fostered the creation of an entirely new class of refugees; the U.S. military has been required to police the region for an undetermined and unspecified amount of time; our own NATO allies' financial and military obligation to the endeavor remains questionable; ethnic related violent incidents in the region have increased; commitment by the region's leaders to embrace reconciliation efforts are conspicuous by their absence; and now Americans and Congress are being asked to provide nearly $2 billion in additional funding for contingency operations in Kosovo. 
   Just this week, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released its report on the U.S. involvement in the Balkans. The report is critical of not only the U.S. and NATO participation in the region, but provides further doubt about the long-term prospect for peace in Kosovo. The report points out that the security situation remains highly volatile, that political and social reconciliation efforts are unsuccessful, that the wartime goals of the factions remain intact, and that NATO has failed to prepare for the transition of security responsibilities to the United Nations. 
   In addition, the GAO reports that between 1992 and 2000, U.S. military and civilian costs for operations in Bosnia and Kosovo have cost the American taxpayer more than $18 billion. This figure includes commitments by the State Department, DoD, the U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping missions, the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Treasury. 
   GAO also concluded that between 1991 and 1999, more than 4.4 million people have been displaced as a result of the wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia. A large share of these people remain in refugee camps. These displaced, war torn individuals have lost their homes, and have few prospects to regain them. 
   In spite of such a massive financial and political commitment, the report also concludes that should NATO withdraw, unrest is inevitable. Political leaders have not embraced change, people who have tried to return to their homes have been attacked, the peace process has been continuously obstructed by ethnic groups, the economy remains flat, and efforts to advance the formulation of a multiethnic society have failed. 
   Our asserted goals are a multiethnic Kosovo as a part of Yugoslavia; the Kosovars want independence and the expulsion of all Serbs. 
   With all of these negative forces at play against the peace process, how long does the United States intend to police the region? How many more taxpayer dollars will be spent on security issues in Kosovo that appear to have little or no possibility of reformation? What is the price for peace, if peace is even attainable? 
   One of the reasons that I opposed the war in Kosovo from the beginning was not the risk that we were going to lose the war but the consequences of winning. We now have ``won'', we have won most of what we asked for in the beginning, but the consequences of winning is that we are putting thousands of our troops into Kosovo without any thought of when they will return. 
   I am convinced that a U.S. presence may continue in Kosovo for a generation or so. We have, and most likely will expend billions of dollars in an out of the way place that has never been important to our national security, and we are doing it in a way in which most of the destruction that we are going to pay for in the future was caused by us. Most Americans are going to find that Kosovo was much easier to get into than it was to get out of. 
   I intend to vote against the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations bill because of my deep concern over the U.S. commitment and participation in the Balkan conflict. It is time to leave it to the Europeans. Even though the State of Washington, home to the most efficient, strategically positioned, and significant Army, Navy and Air Force bases stand to inherit valuable military construction funds by the passage of this legislation, I cannot in good conscience support another financial commitment to an unresolvable conflict in the Balkans. 
   Those brave and courageous men and women of the U.S. military who have been tasked with implementing this Kosovo intervention, and those serving in the Armed Forces in the State of Washington, have my admiration and support. But in the goal of attaining peace in the Balkans, of the Administration's questionable leadership in this endeavor, and the long-term commitment that is expected of the American taxpayer, I have no confidence at all.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, all of us have read accounts of Americans crossing our borders in order to buy vital prescription drugs at deeply discounted prices. Every day seniors and other Americans can save 50 percent, 60 percent, or even 70 percent on their drug bill simply by going to Canada or Mexico. A busload of seniors from Seattle recently saved $12,000 just by driving two hours north to buy their medications at a Canadian pharmacy. 
   The reason drugs are so much less expensive in Canada, Mexico, and other countries? American manufacturers sell products that were discovered, developed and manufactured in the United States for far lower prices in virtually every other country in the world than the prices they charge American customers. 
   Why? Every other country imposes some form of a price control on prescription drugs. As long as we let our drug companies impose all of their research and development costs on American consumers, our drug manufacturers agree to this arrangement because they can recoup their manufacturing costs and still make some profit. But the price other countries pay in no way compensates for the expensive research and development costs for new drugs. American consumers end up subsidizing the research and development for the rest of the world. 
   When Americans pay higher prices at the drug store cash register, that is not the first time they subsidize the research and development of new drugs. Taxpayer dollars are used to fund the research conducted by the National Institutes of Health; much of the basic science conducted with NIH grants is then transferred to the private sector. Taxpayer money is also the major source of funds for training scientific personnel, scientists hired by the drug industry in large numbers. 
   According to a 1993 report by the Office of Technology, in addition to general research and training support, there are 13 programs specifically targeted to fund pharmaceutical research and development. That same report noted: ``Of all U.S. industries, innovation within the pharmaceutical industry is the most dependent on academic research and the Federal funds that support it.'' 
   Finally there are the tax breaks: for research and development, for orphan drug development; and possession tax credits for manufacturing drugs in Puerto Rico. 
   Let me be clear. I understand and support the need to invest in research and development. I have supported all of the programs I just spoke about including the National Institutes of Health and the Research and Development tax credit. I also agree that drug companies should be able to recoup costs associated with research and development. But I do not think that American consumers should be the only ones to foot that bill. American consumers who already strongly support R&D efforts through their tax dollars should not have to pay for R&D costs again in the form of higher prices at the drug store. All users, domestic and foreign, should pay a fair share of those costs. 
   But drug companies are satisfied with the status quo. They know that they can simply raise prices in the U.S., if other countries negotiate or regulate to win lower prices. American consumers should not be subject to this kind of price discrimination--especially for products that are vitally important to preserving our health. 
   My idea is to borrow from a law that has applied to interstate commerce within the United States for the last 60 years--the Robinson-Patman Anti-discrimination Act. It simply says that manufacturers may not use price to discriminate among like buyers. My bill, the Prescription Drug Fairness Act, takes these same principles and applies them to prescription drug sales overseas. Drug manufacturers would not be able to offer lower prices at the wholesale level in Canada, Mexico or any other country than they charge inside the United States. 
   Since 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act has established as a legal norm the concept of fair dealing in pricing by prohibiting unjustified price discrimination. The same principle of fair dealing should be applied to prescription drug sales to wholesale buyers in different countries. 
   The drug companies have demonized my idea by labeling it ``price control.'' If this is a price 
   control then we have had price controls on every product sold in the United States for the last 60 years. My bill in no way tells drug companies what they can or can not charge for a prescription drug. It simply says that they cannot discriminate against Americans. 
   I asked the pharmaceutical companies for their ideas to ensure that Americans are treated fairly and have access to affordable prescription drugs. Their response? They simply want to expand Medicare by adding drug coverage for its recipients. While I do think coverage is one important part of the solution for seniors--it is only a partial answer. 
   It does nothing to address the cost for the uninsured American and does  nothing to address the growing concerns of employers, health plans, and hospitals about rising costs associated with prescription drugs. As more and more people use prescription drugs, drug costs take up more of overall health care spending. But drugs are also costing Americans more. Last week, Families USA released a study that showed the average cost of the 50 drugs most commonly used by seniors rose by 3.9 percent, outpacing the inflation rate of 2.2 percent. A study from the University of Maryland's Center on Drugs and Public Policy projects prescription drug expenditures will rise 15-18 percent annually. Total prescription drug expenditures could double between 1999 and 2004 from $105 billion to $121 billion. 
   I do think the Medicare program should be modernized to include a prescription drug benefit. If we expand the program, however, it must be done responsibly and must not jeopardize the benefits seniors currently have. CBO estimates that the program will be insolvent by 2023. While there are a number of ideas for how to structure a benefit, the sticking point always seems to be how to pay for it. CBO recently revised its estimate of the President's proposal. It is expected to cost $160 billion between 2003 and 2010. And that is for minimal coverage up to $1,000 (with seniors paying a second $1,000 out-of-pocket), relatively high premiums, and no protection for those seniors with exceptionally high drug bills. 
   My skepticism about the industry's support for simply expanding Medicare is increased by reports in the Wall Street Journal last week that Medicare and Medicaid have overpaid the drug industry by as much as $1 billion a year for the few drugs these programs do cover. My idea would save Medicare beneficiaries money on their drug bills and would in no way jeopardize the solvency of the fiscally ailing Medicare program. 
   I am convinced that we need to address the issue of price discrimination this year, not only for Medicare patients but for the health system overall. I am pleased to note that Senator JEFFORDS will hold a hearing on the issue of drug pricing and safety in the next few weeks and I hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee, to which my bill has been referred, will also take a look at this issue. 
   In the meantime, while seniors and health plans, employers, hospitals and others struggle with the growing cost of prescription drugs, the pharmaceutical industry has been among the most profitable U.S. Industries in the last five years, with year to year earnings growing by more than 10 percent and for some companies 20 percent. So far, they have refused to engage in this debate. 
   I hope they will change their minds. Right now the current system leaves the drug companies' best customers feeling like they've been ripped off. Bob Elmer from University Place, Washington recently wrote:  
   I am a recently retired pharmacist ..... and have always been proud of the American pharmaceutical manufacturers and the role that they play in ..... the search for new and innovative entities that help us live not only longer, but better. As a matter of fact, I worked for a major manufacturer for some time. 
   I, like you, am outraged at the manufacturers' practices of charging the American public more than the Mexican public or the Canadian public. What is their rationale for the price differences? 
   This overcharging is a black mark on this industry.  
   Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. Drug companies should no longer be allowed to discriminate against Americans by charging higher prices here than they do elsewhere in the world. My bill will end that discrimination.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1989, the Department of Energy signed an historic agreement with the State of Washington and the Environmental Protection Agency, committing to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the South-Central part of the State of Washington. This pact, known as ``The Tri-Party Agreement'' has, for the most part, worked well to assure that the federal government keeps its commitment to the citizens of the state of Washington to keep the byproducts of nuclear materials production from harming the people who live and work in that area. 
   Last year, responding to different pressures, Congress created the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Some officials, including my own state Attorney General, are concerned that the creation of the NNSA may create some uncertainty as to the Department of Energy's continued legal obligation to clean up the site. The NNSA was never intended to disrupt the enforceability of legal agreements that assure sites such as Hanford are to be cleaned up under specific timelines. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to clarify that environmental, safety and health provisions continue to apply to the functions of the recently created NNSA to the same extent as they applied to those functions before transfer to the NNSA. 
   While the legislative history of the legislation creating the National Nuclear Security Administration demonstrated clear Congressional intent that the NNSA remain subject to state, federal and local environment, safety and health requirements, some have raised concern that the legislation could be construed as narrowing the existing waivers of federal sovereign immunity with respect to these requirements.  
   The Department of Energy hosts some of the most challenging environmental contamination sites in the country. Although the Hanford site is perhaps the biggest challenge, there are sites in several other states as well. 
   It is critical to the preservation of the environment and the protection of human health that states maintain their existing authority to enforce environmental, safety, and health requirements with respect to Department of Energy facilities under the NNSA's control. 
   A wide range of support exists for this legislation clarifying that the earlier legislation creating the NNSA was not intended to impair state regulatory authority over facilities under the NNSA's jurisdiction. Organizations supporting this legislation include the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National Association of Attorneys General. 
   Just as this bill will clarify that the NNSA does not impair state regulatory authority over facilities under the NNSA's jurisdiction, the bill is carefully worded so as not to expand the states' authority in this regard. This bill simply reaffirms the ability of states to use the enforcement measures that are contained in cleanup agreements made with the federal government, such as the Tri-Party Agreement.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to commemorate one of the most significant events in the history of my state--the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. On the 18th of May, 1980, Mt. St. Helens exploded with the force of a 24-megaton atomic bomb, scorching 230 square miles of picturesque Northwest landscape and triggered the largest known landslide in history, traveling at nearly 200 mph to bury Spirit Lake and the Toutle River. Tragically, fifty-seven men and women lost their lives, over 200 homes and 180 miles of road were destroyed and caused $3 billion in damages. 
   Since that horrific day, the great people of Washington state began the long road to recovery. Today, I would like to recognize the astounding efforts of thousands of volunteers and donations from countless companies that have succeeded in making Mt. St. Helens a place where trees are growing at record speeds and animals are beginning to thrive in their new home. 
   Mt. St. Helens is now a place where tens of thousands of visitors flock every year from around the globe to witness both the violent and healing powers of nature. Local residents devastated by the eruption have transformed their communities and now look to Mt. St. Helens to attract visitors and contribute to the local economy. 
   There is still, however, an enormous amount of work to be done to help Mt. St. Helens and the surrounding areas continue on this path to recovery. The local communities' dedication to rebuilding infrastructure and ecosystems, the creation of a renowned research facility, and the construction of a world-class tourist attraction have demonstrated the highest degree of responsiveness and resourcefulness. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Forest Service for their achievements and commitment in bringing Mt. St. Helens back to life. 
   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and a member of the Mt. St. Helens Institute Advisory Board, I am deeply committed to helping Mt. St. Helens make the best possible recovery and to finding federal dollars to keep Mt. St. Helens accessible and enjoyable for all visitors and to assist the surrounding communities in finding solutions to their many challenges. 
   I am confident that in the next twenty years the people of the Northwest will make even greater strides in reviving the beauty of Mt. St. Helens, making Washington state an even greater place to live.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to honor one of the oldest and top community colleges in the great state of Washington. In honor, of their 75th Anniversary, I would like to say a few words about this fine academic institution. 
   Centralia College serves the citizens of Southcentral Washington, offering outstanding community service programs and a high quality of student life. Centralia College, however, extends beyond traditional instruction of its students and participates in the greater-Centralia community, providing residents with informative and interesting public lectures, art shows and cultural events. Clearly, Centralia College is an integral part of the surrounding community. 
   Students at Centralia College study a variety of disciplines from accounting and nursing to computer and forestry technology, receiving a well-rounded education that will prepare them for a bright and challenging future. 
   Furthermore, Centralia College offers students an international experience. Students have the opportunity to study in a number of foreign countries or learn from the many international students that attend Centralia College. I applaud Centralia College for its commitment to expanding its students' horizons and exposing them to new ideas and different ways of life. 
   The faculty at Centralia College are extremely dedicated to giving their students a balanced education and emphasize the importance of critical thinking skills, writing, oral and visual communication as well as fostering in their students a sense of resourcefulness and responsibility.  
   I believe that the faculty's continuous hard work and dedication to these goals has made their students successful and contributing citizens of Washington state. Education is more than merely memorizing facts and Centralia College teaches its students vital problem solving and communication skills that will lead our country in the new millennium and give them a solid foundation to help Washington state continue in its prosperity. 
   I wish Centralia College another successful 75 years. It is institutions like Centralia College that make Washington state one of the best places to live.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, more than 6 months ago I signified my support for the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Initiative when it came to the Senate floor for a vote. Today, I stand again with a bipartisan collection of my colleagues, a broad base of industry, faith-based and religious groups, a variety of free trade advocates, and supporters from the sub-Saharan African nations and the Caribbean to advocate for swift passage of this legislation. 
   To begin, Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN should be applauded for producing and delivering this legislation after more than three years of deliberation and negotiation. The long and arduous task of attaining agreements between U.S. industry and their counterparts in Africa and the Caribbean, as well as assuring that the various trade interests from all sides were accommodated, is a task that should be commended. 
   As we continue to prosper and advance in this expanding and ever changing world economy, it is essential that the United States reach out to all regions of the globe. By unilaterally expanding access to U.S. markets, sub-Saharan nations and the Caribbean will be afforded new trade and investment policies that will propel these regions into 21st Century trade practices. 
   Trade with the United States does imply that certain practices be instituted and embraced by participating nations. This bill promotes the establishment and development of free-market economies, insists on human rights standards, and champions democratic and economic principles, the U.S. expects from our trading partners. 
   From textiles and apparel, to agriculture and specialty goods, not only does the United States stand to prosper from this trade agreement, but, so too do the sub-Saharan and Caribbean nations. While some have argued that U.S. companies could be harmed by expanded trade with these regions, stringent requirements regarding the transshipment of goods have been incorporated into the legislation. In addition, the bill includes a provision that enables the U.S. Customs Service to assist these countries with illegal transshipments. 
   While I am somewhat disappointed that the bill no longer includes the reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Generalized System of Preferences, the crux of the bill, its intent, and its long-term impact on trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean make it well worthy of passage. In addition, my home State of Washington, the most trade dependent state in the nation, naturally stands to gain from increased trade. 
   Again, I reiterate my support for the legislation and its far-reaching intent. With such a broad base of advocates vying for its passage, not to mention the partnerships in trade this legislation creates for the United States, this measure deserves our support and swift approval.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Vice President of the United States is flying to Oregon this evening, or tomorrow morning, for a visit to that State. On the last five or six occasions on which he has visited the State of Washington, I have inquired of him, as politely as possible, as to his intentions with respect to the future of four dams on the Snake River. This inquiry is of significant importance to the people of the State of Washington, as well as the people of the State of Oregon. The answer from the Vice President is peculiarly important because of the disarray of the present administration. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended that the dams come down, be removed, for salmon recovery. The Corps of Engineers, almost a year ago, was ready to recommend that the dams stay in place and that we deal with salmon recovery in another productive fashion. That recommendation was vetoed by the White House and removed physically from the Corps of Engineers' report. 
   More recently, the National Marine Fishery Service has said that we don't know enough to decide whether or not we should remove the dams and that the decision may be at least 5 or 10 years away. The Governor of Oregon has recommended that the dams come down. The Governor of Washington, also a Democrat, has opposed that recommendation. As you know, Mr. President, so have I, in the most vehement possible terms. Of all of the proposals for salmon recovery, dam removal is, first, the most ineffective and, second, of the most marginal utility with respect to the recovery of the salmon resource in the Pacific Northwest. 
   At a capital expenditure of $1 billion to $2 billion, and annual losses of at  least a third of a billion dollars in perpetuity, the promise of salmon recovery from dam removal is extremely marginal, with no impact on some of the endangered runs, and only a modest improvement in the order of 10 to 20 percent in the prospects for certain other runs. Weighed against that are the potential real successes from the Salmon Recovery Board of the State of Washington, which has for the current year an appropriation from the Congress of $18 million for the work of citizen-based salmon recovery teams, which will be the beneficiary of an appropriation from this body of about $4 million. 
   There is a very real concern with predation at the mouth of the Columbia River--a concern now frustrated by a lawsuit against any removal of Caspian terns from an artificial island at the mouth of the river by at least a temporary injunction. These and dozens of other projects in the Pacific Northwest have a far greater promise for the salmon recovery than does dam removal, with all of its devastating impacts on the loss of benign, renewable energy power, to be substituted by the use of fossil fuels, for all of the loss of agricultural land that requires irrigation to be anything other than a desert, for all the loss of a transportation system which is the most efficient and environmentally benign for the transportation of grain to ports on the lower Columbia River. 
   All of these factors argue against dam removal. But the Vice President of the United States, in his candidacy for President of the United States, refuses to make any commitment whatsoever on this matter. Now, it may be that he didn't want to respond to this Senator on these visits to the State of Washington. But he is now going to be asked to respond by the Governor of Oregon, who supports his candidacy. His response has been demanded by the Portland Oregonian, the largest newspaper in the State of Oregon, which, incidentally, holds my position and that of my colleague, Senator SMITH of Oregon, on the subject. One hopes that the Vice President will finally be able to come up with an opinion. Now, he has taken positions on other local issues. He is certainly quite willing to tell the people of South Carolina what flag they can fly. But he seems unwilling to tell the people of Washington and Oregon what his views are on an issue of vital importance to them and to their regional economy. 
   So I am here to express the hope that the Vice President will finally come clean with his views on this subject. But I must express the expectation that he will, once again, dodge the issue, pretend that he has not made up his mind when, in fact, he has, and claim that he can't make a substantive comment on this until after the election in November is over. I will regret that, Mr. President. His opponent, the Governor of Texas, has taken the forthright stand that it is improper and uneconomical and unwise to remove those dams. He will protect the physical infrastructure of the Pacific Northwest. I am here to invite the Vice President of the United States to do likewise, without, I regret to say, any expectation that he is willing to do so.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge a very unique school district in a forested area of Washington State. The Index School District may be small in size but if measured by the creativity and dedication of its teachers, staff, and parents, it would be one of the largest districts in Washington state. 
   Index School District is one of the smallest in the state, with only 35 students from preschool to 7th grade. Because of the district's size and location in a rural area, the district has constantly struggled to find funding that could boost student achievement. Index's Superintendent and Principal, Martin Boyle, took the funding challenges head on and has worked tirelessly to find money for Index's students through federal grants and a $298,208 bond levy that was passed in 1998. After four years of hard work, the Index School District has become a model for other schools. 
   Improving student reading levels was one of the first goals Boyle and his colleagues accomplished. The district hired a reading specialist and with the help of parents and local volunteers, reading levels have soared. Recently, Boyle started a new mentor reading program called, ``Help One Student to Succeed.'' He hopes it will get parents involved in teaching their children to read, as well as a new way to promote and innovate reading skills, advancing student reading levels by an even greater margin. 
   Index School District's includes 20 staff members and 5 board members who work tirelessly for their students and are constantly brainstorming new activities and new programs that will help their students learn. They have even started an after-school program for children who in the past, were sitting outside waiting for their parents' workday to end. Students now use this extra time to participate in fun activities that reinforce classroom curriculum. 
   In addition, last summer, the district implemented the Index Elementary Summer School Program where students take part in hands on art and cultural activities. Students also visit art museums and theaters, as well as travel to other parts of the state for hiking and camping activities, giving children opportunities to learn and challenge their knowledge outside the classroom. 
   Many students at Index also depend on their school as a home away from home, relying on the school for three meals a day. While a majority of students qualify for free and reduced lunches, the staff of Index understands the importance of meals for their students and have made it a priority to create and fund a food program which was recognized with a ``Children's Alliance Award.'' 
   The innovation and commitment of the Index School District's staff is truly inspiring. Clearly, the children are succeeding in the classroom and will be ready to take on any challenge. I think it is uplifting to hear that the power of a few can empower many, as the educator's of Index have done. Every local school district is unique. I hope that highlighting Index with my ``Innovation in Education'' Award will show others that wonderful things happen when you put children first.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor in the presence of my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, the primary sponsor of this proposal. For well over a year, the Senator has shared his thoughtful ideas with me and with other Members on this side of the aisle. 
   While this is certainly not my proposal--it is not Straight A's by any stretch of the imagination--it does represent, in the view of this Senator, a genuine and thoughtful approach to the proposition that we haven't been doing everything right for the last 10, 20, 30, 35 years and that there is a newer and better way to provide education services to our children directed at seeing they get a better education and their achievement improves. 
   The proposal the Senator from Connecticut has before the Senate is a thoughtful and imaginative approach to our innovation in education. There have been a number of comments during the course of the day and earlier that the Senator from Connecticut and some of his friends and allies have been working with this Senator and others to see if we could marry most or many of the propositions contained in the current amendment--relating to Straight A's, to the Teacher Empowerment Act, and to portability --in a way that would reach across the aisle not with a half a dozen Members on each side of the aisle supporting the proposition but perhaps with a majority of the Members of the Senate. 
   While I can't say I am a supporter of the proposition exactly as it appears before the Senate, it does offer very real possibilities not only for a constructive debate on education policy but for a constructive resolution to the better education that every Member in this body, whatever his or her philosophy, seeks. I hope there may this afternoon even be a symbol of the fact we are beginning to work together. 
   I must say, there are clear differences even in negotiations over a middle ground. It is certainly possible they will not be surmountable. This Senator, however, hopes they will be. I think the Senator from Connecticut does. At the same time, there may be Members who do not desire a partnership that has involved matters other than this from time to time in a way that has upset certain Members of this body. 
   I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his thoughtful and sincere efforts and express the hope publicly that they may lead to something which will unite, rather than divide, members of both parties.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the subject before the Senate this afternoon, and until the vote is taken on it tomorrow, is the Lott-Gregg amendment to the Teacher Empowerment Act section of this bill. 
   The Teacher Empowerment Act itself is quite significant in a number of ways, primarily in focusing on increased teacher quality across the United States of America but, at the same time, allowing a maximum degree of flexibility in local choices with respect to how that teacher quality is, in fact, enhanced. 
   It provides a significant amount of money for teacher training that can also be used for increasing the number of teachers, for increasing the competition of those teachers most prized by  our school districts across the country. For with the amendment that is added today--with the recruiting of people in midcareer from other professions, who will be quality teachers of particular subjects--it will provide a degree of protection against frivolous lawsuits when teachers or administrators or school authorities have taken actions that will protect the safety and security of students in classrooms and of the faculty and administration of the schools themselves. We literally have faced the situation in which actions taken in good faith, and for valid reasons, have subjected teachers and administrators to frivolous lawsuits brought by lawyers for highly disruptive and destructive students. 
   It does seem to me that the specific amendment on which we are going to vote will be effective in providing that kind of protection, providing a modest program to recruit quality people in midcareers into teaching, and to assure that the $2 billion authorization for teacher quality can be used in a widely significant fashion for increasing the quality of teaching, not only the quantity, though that is there, but the quality of teaching in our public schools. 
   The accountability, in this case, again, is going to be a student accountability. Are the results positive, from the perspective of student achievement in our schools? In that respect, of course, both the amendment that is before us at the present time and the portion of the bill to which the amendment applies are consistent with the overall philosophy of the bill, a philosophy that is perhaps summarized best by saying that after 35 years of procedural accountability--that is to say, proving that money was used for the precise purposes for which the authorization was directed, with a seeming total indifference to whether or not student achievement improved, a procedural accountability which was satisfied by filling out forms correctly and by having clean audits--now it is to be succeeded by a performance accountability, 
   accountability that says, after all, that we aim our assistance to public education across the United States of America to see to it that our students themselves are better educated; that their test results in the multitude of achievement tests being developed across the United States show actual progress; that this is the accountability we wish; that this is the accountability that is found in Straight A's; that this is the kind of accountability that is found in the Teacher Enhancement Act in this bill; and that this is the goal of these amendments today. 
   We have a curious debate on the other side, one speaking about the successes of title I, a title with which all the goodwill in the world has not reduced the disparity between its beneficiaries and other students in the extended period of time; a position that says the status quo is to be protected at all costs; and a position that says parental control and influence over public education is something to be feared. 
   We on this side of the aisle have every hope that the rather dramatic change from procedural accountability to performance accountability will result in a true improvement in the quality of education being given to our schoolchildren as measured by their actual achievement. That is, in fact, our goal. 
   Having said that, I should also say there are at least some signs during this second week of debate over the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that we may be able to reach across the political divide and find a way to satisfy a substantial number of members of both parties in a way consistent with the precise goals I have outlined here with the proposition that we need to encourage innovation, that we need to encourage parental involvement, and that we need to provide a degree of trust and confidence in those men and women across the United States who have devoted their lives and their professional careers to the education of our children, together with those who volunteer for the slings and arrows of political campaigns and run for office as school board members--that perhaps all wisdom with respect to education policy does not preside in this body and in the Department of Education down the street; that perhaps those who know our children's names may very well know best what priorities should be funded in 17,000 different school districts with 17,000 different types of challenges across the United States. 
   The amendment before us at the present time leads us in that direction. The Teachers Enhancement Act that is a part of this bill leads us in that direction. Straight A's leads us in that direction. I hope we will soon have a proposal involving some reason from both sides of the political aisle in this body that will lead us in that direction as well. 
   At the present time, however, I commend to my colleagues the Lott-Gregg amendment. I think it improves an already very first-rate bill--the product of a tremendous amount of work on the part of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, one of the best pieces of working proposals in this body and by one of its committees in an extended period of time. 
   I have a far greater hope today than I did 2 or 3 weeks ago that this body may actually not only begin a debate on education but may conclude a debate on education with a successful vote, and at the very least send this thoughtful bill, slightly amended, to a conference committee, and one hopes from that conference committee to the President of the United States.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, here we go again. Fourteen pages of the statute set out precise and detailed requirements to be imposed on 17,000 school districts around the country, the bottom line of which is that we know what they need better than any of them do. Fourteen pages of statute that, if the precedent has any value, will turn into 114 pages of regulations from the U.S. Department of Education, all under the mantra of smaller class sizes. 
   Well, in spite of conflicting views on the precise impact of smaller class sizes in various parts of the country, one may even start by admitting that in many cases this is a good idea. But this amendment says not only is it a good idea, it is the only idea; it is the only way to spend a very considerable amount of money in every single school district around the country, no matter what its own priorities. No matter what its own parents, teachers, superintendents, and elected school board members think, we are telling you right here--100 of us in this national school board--this is what you need. 
   Will it naturally put any more money into the schools? I doubt it. It is a large authorization, but we have already passed the budget resolution, and we pretty much know how much money there is going to be available for education. So, essentially, if it is passed and if it is appropriated for, it will come out of other educational priorities. 
   Let's just take one. Thirty years ago, and again 3 or 4 years ago, we passed 150 pages of a law for special education. Most of the Members who are voting today were Members of the Senate then. We promised we would pay 40 percent of those costs. Due primarily to efforts on this side of the aisle, we have gone from 8 percent to 11 percent. In another 30 or 40 
   years, we might get to the promise that we made with respect to education for the disabled. But that was a priority of 3 years ago. What we need now are another bunch of new programs which have one thing, one feature alone, in common. They say school board members, superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents all across the United States are not the best judges of what they need to provide a better education for our children. 
   The Senator from Arkansas, who is on the floor, has pointed it out, and the Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out that the bill before us, which will end up supplying as much money as the other bills will, certainly allows any school district with a primary goal of more teachers to use  much more money for hiring new teachers. It differs in the fact that it doesn't mandate that as the No. 1 priority for every school district. Maybe most will want to hire new teachers, and some will want to keep their best teachers in place by paying them more money. Some may want to use the money for physical infrastructure. Some may want to use it for specialized teachers and specialized courses that are not allowed under this amendment. Some may want to train their teachers better. Some may wish for more computers. But the most difficult virtue to practice in this body is the practice of letting go, saying we don't know it all; we can't set the absolute priorities for every school district in the United States. 
   Let's stick with what we have on the table at the present time. Let's stick with the bill that dramatically says the present system of more and more statutes and more and more requirements has not been a striking success over the last 35 years. Let's try, at least in a few places in this country, to let our schools' own people, our professional educators, those who care most, those who know our children, make the decisions that will affect their lives and their education.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, environmental protection and states' rights were dealt a blow on March 6th, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case of United States vs. Locke. The Court, noting that even though federal and international laws ``may be insufficient protection,'' invalidated Washington laws, and potentially laws in eleven other states, that provide protections against spills by oil tankers. I disagree with the Court's decision, because I believe that Washington state should be allowed to protect its shores as it sees fit. 
   That is why, today I am pleased to introduce the ``States Prevention of Oil Tanker Spills Act'' (SPOTS)-legislation that will reinstate the right of all states to adopt additional standards beyond existing federal requirements governing the operation, maintenance, equipment, personnel and manning of oil tankers. While this legislation will apply to all shoreline states, it is particularly important to Washington. 
   Washington has always taken seriously its duty to protect the health and safety of its citizens, and has historically supported aggressive protections of its treasured natural resources, including Washington shorelines and waterways. Oil refineries and product terminals located in Cherry Point, Ferndale, Tacoma, Anacortes, and nearby Vancouver, British Columbia make Washington an international destination and shipping point for millions of tons of oil annually. A large volume of crude oil is transported to and from the state near heavily populated Puget Sound. 
   The frequent traffic of large vessels carrying vast amounts of oil increases the risks to the environment and public safety, and unfortunately, has resulted in devastating spills. The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster was one of the most environmentally devastating in United States history. The huge oil tanker ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean, and damaging more than 1,000 miles of coastline in south-central Alaska. The massive spill resulted in billions of dollars in damage claims by over 40,000 people, including some 6,500 Washington fishermen who have yet to be compensated for their loss. 
   Incidents such as the Valdez disaster served as a catalyst for Washington and many other ocean shoreline states--as well as Congress--to enact laws to prevent similar catastrophic events. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Washington passed its own legislation in 1994, which created the state Office of Marine Safety and directed the establishment of prevention plans for ``the best achievable protection'' from the damage caused by oil spills. 
   Washington's law enhanced, or added a number of requirements to, the federal law. For example, instead of merely requiring tanker crews to ``clearly understand English,'' as federal law prescribes, the state regulation required tanker crews to be proficient in English in order to prevent miscommunication between American navigators and foreign crews. To heighten safety protection in times of limited visibility due to fog or other inclement weather conditions common to the Puget Sound, the state also added a requirement that a tanker  have on its bridge at least three licensed officers, a helmsman, and a lookout. Among other requirements adopted by Washington are prescriptions regarding training, location plotting, pre-arrival tests, and drug testing for tanker crews. 
   While federal law governs the design and construction of tankers, as well as issues affecting Coast Guard and national security, I believe that states should have the right to enact additional regulations that they believe will enhance the safety of their citizens and natural 
   resources. Twenty states' Attorneys General signed an amicus brief in United States vs. Locke, agreeing with Washington on this point. 
   Unfortunately, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, (``INTERTANKO''), a group of companies that own or operate more than 2,000 tankers in the United States and foreign nations, does not agree with this common sense proposition. Shortly after Washington's oil tanker law was enacted. INTERTANKO filed a lawsuit to overturn it. A federal district court ruled in Washington's favor, but the Administration voluntarily intervened in the oil tanker companies' appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Coast Guard's weaker regulations superseded the state's requirements on oil tankers. 
   Some have suggested that additional state regulation would interfere with the federal government's relations with foreign governments. In my view, allowing states to add common sense safety measures would have little, if any, impact on foreign relations. It would, however, enhance environmental protection. 
   This legislation won't eliminate all oil spills. I believe, however, that it will help to prevent some. Laws protecting our shores from dangerous oil spills should not be brought to the lowest common denominator. Rather, allowing states to enhance federal laws where appropriate, will ensure an even greater level of protection for our citizens and resources in the future. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the proposed remedies submitted last Friday by the U.S. Department of Justice and 17 States in the antitrust suit against Microsoft. As my colleagues know, the Department of Justice and the States have asked the court to break Microsoft into two separate companies, and to require significant Government regulation of the two companies. 
   Let's begin by reviewing the charges in the case. First, the Government has alleged that Microsoft entered into a series of agreements with software developers, Internet Service Providers, Internet content providers, and online services like AOL, that foreclosed Netscape's ability to distribute its Web browsing software. Despite claims by Government lawyers and outside commentators that this was the strongest part of the Government's case, the trial court--even Judge Jackson--disagreed. The court ruled that Microsoft's agreements did not deprive Netscape of the ability to reach PC users. Indeed, the trial court pointed out the many ways in which Netscape could, and did, distribute Navigator. Direct evidence of this broad distribution can be found in the fact that the installed base of Navigator users increased from 15 million in 1996 to 33 million in late 1998--the very period in which the Government contends that Microsoft foreclosed Netscape's distribution. 
   The second charge involves what the Government alleged was the unlawful ``tying'' of Internet Explorer to Windows. The Government argued that this ``tying'' was one of the primary means by which Microsoft foreclosed Netscape's ability to distribute Navigator. The trial court agreed with the Government, finding that Microsoft violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act in its design of Windows 95 and 98. The court's conclusion is astounding in two respects. First, as I mentioned, the trial court determined that Microsoft had not deprived Netscape of distribution opportunities. Second, and even more important, the trial court's conclusion is in direct contradiction to that of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. In June, 1998--before the antitrust trial even began--that court of appeals rejected the charge that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows 95 was wrongful. In its June, 1998 decision, the appeals court stated that ``new products integrating functionalities in a useful way should be considered single products regardless of market structure.'' Despite the fact that trial courts are obliged to follow the rulings of appellate courts, the trial court in the Microsoft case has singularly failed to do so. 
   In its third charge, the Government alleged that Microsoft held a monopoly in Intel-compatible PC operating systems, and maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive tactics. The trial court agreed, and determined that there were three anticompetitive tools employed by Microsoft: (1) the series of agreements that the trial court itself held did not violate antitrust law; (2) the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows, which the Appellate Court already determined was not illegal; and (3) a random assortment of acts involving Microsoft's discussions with other firms, such as Apple and Intel--none of which led to agreements. In relying on these three factors, the trial court seems to have concluded that, while Microsoft's actions, taken individually, might not constitute violations of antitrust law, the combination of these lawful acts constitutes a violation of law. This approach to antitrust liability has generally been rejected by courts, in part because it fails to provide guidance allowing businesses to  understand their legal obligations. Such a rule effectively chills desirable competitive conduct. 
   Finally, the trial court agreed with the Government's allegation that Microsoft unlawfully attempted to monopolize the market for Web browsing software. This conclusion is directly at odds with the court's own previous finding. In the findings of fact released in November of last year, the trial court found that Microsoft's conduct with respect to Netscape was aimed at preventing Netscape from dominating Web browsing software--not at gaining a monopoly for Microsoft. Under antitrust law, a firm cannot be found liable for attempted monopolization unless it specifically intends to monopolize the market. Seeking to prevent somebody else from acquiring a monopoly is not attempted monopolization. 
   To summarize, one of the Government's charges was dismissed by the trial court; another flouts a specific decision of the appellate court; and the remaining two simply provide no legal basis as antitrust violations. I am highly confident that the appeals court will once again recognize the fundamental flaws in the trial court's decision and find in favor of Microsoft. 
   In the meantime, however, let's examine the ``remedy'' proposed by the Department of Justice and 17 States for these fictional violations. First, and most obvious, is the Government's proposal to break Microsoft into two separate companies. Under the Government plan, Windows would be retained by the new ``Operating Systems Business,'' while the remainder of Microsoft, including its office family of products on its Internet properties, would be moved into a new ``Application Business.'' The Department of Justice plan effectively prohibits these two companies from working together for a period of 10 years and effectively freezes fundamental components of the operating system from improvement, thereby crippling in this fast-moving world of technology the very technology which is one of the principal bases of our present prosperity. 
   As outrageous as the proposal to break up Microsoft is, the heavyhanded regulations the Government proposes to impose on Microsoft are at least as outrageous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Mr. McCullagh did an excellent job of outlining these extraordinary regulations. I will highlight a few. 
   Under the Department of Justice proposal, the Government would require Microsoft to create an entirely new executive position, as well as a new committee on its corporate board of directors, the function of which would be to ensure the company's compliance with the Government's new regulations. 
   The Department of Justice would require Microsoft to ``maintain for a period of at least 4 years the e-mail of all Microsoft officers, directors, and managers engaged in software development, marketing, sales, and developer relations related to Platform Software.'' 
   Under the proposed remedy, Microsoft would also be required to give the Government ``access during office hours'' to inspect and demand copies of all ``books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, source code, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of Microsoft'' relating to the matters contained in the final judgment. Not only that, the Government, ``without restraint or interference'' from Microsoft, could demand to question any officers, employees, or agents of the company. 
   Together with the other sanctions, these proposals would guarantee that every Microsoft competitor would know everything the two Microsofts plan long before the plans became reality. Mr. President, that is a death sentence. 
   The function of relief in an antitrust case is to enjoin the conduct found to be anticompetitive and to enhance competition. Any objective review of the ``remedies'' proposed by the Department of Justice and States, however, can only lead to the conclusion that the Government is not seeking relief from anticompetitive behavior but to punish Microsoft with unwarranted sanctions for allegations by threatening its very existence. 
   There is no question that the Department of Justice initiated this antitrust action at the behest of Microsoft's competitors. Those competitors have said they sought Government intervention because it would be ``too expensive'' to pursue private litigation. This unjustified case has been too expensive--way too expensive--but not in the way the competitors envisioned. In the 10 days following the breakdown of settlement talks, there was a $1.7 trillion loss in market capitalization. The damages from that huge loss were not limited to Microsoft--a broad range of companies, including many of Microsoft's competitors, were affected. More importantly, so, too, were millions of American investors. 
   As one would expect, the millions of Americans who hold Microsoft shares have taken a bath in recent weeks. The day after the trial court issued its ``Findings of Law'' on April 3, Microsoft stockholders lost $80 billion in assets. The decline in Microsoft stock helped fuel a 349-point slide in the NASDAQ, the biggest 1-day drop in the history of the exchange. The pain wasn't limited to individual Microsoft shareholders, however. At least 2,000 mutual funds and countless pension funds include Microsoft shares. 
   I find it curious that the Vice President of the United States criticizes as the ``risky scheme'' tax proposals in this body that would reduce taxes by $12 billion in 1 year and $150 billion in 5 years. Yet the very administration that he supports has caused a loss in the pockets of very real American citizens of far in excess of that amount. 
   The ``risky scheme'' is the Microsoft lawsuit and we have now suffered damages from that risk. It is unfortunate that those who were so anxious to bring the heavy hand of Government into this incredibly innovative and successful industry didn't listen to some of the more cautious voices, such as that of Dr. Milton Friedman, who warned early on to be careful what you wish. Dr. Friedman recently reinforced that sentiment in a statement to the National Taxpayers Union:   
   Recent events dealing with the Microsoft suit certainly support the view I expressed a year ago--that Silicon Valley is suicidal in calling Government in to mediate in the disputes among some of the big companies in the area of Microsoft. The money that has been spent on legal maneuvers would have been much more usefully spent on research in technology. The loss of the time spent in the courts by highly trained and skilled lawyers could certainly have been spent more fruitfully. Overall, the major effect has been a decline in the capital value of the computer industry, Microsoft in particular, but its competitors as well. They must rue the day they set this incredible episode in operation.  
   One of the biggest tragedies of this case is that it has all been done in the name of consumer benefit. So far, the only real harm to consumers I have seen has come from the resources wasted on the case itself and from the market convulsions that resulted from the mere specter of the Government's punitive relief proposal.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think the suggestion of the Senator from Massachusetts is an excellent one. As I say, I hope we will debate for the balance of the day on the amendment I have just submitted and on the Democratic alternative. I, for one, will have no objection during the course of the day if the Democratic amendment is before the body more or less contemporaneously with my own. They can be debated at the same time. Whether we will be able to finish today and vote on both of them is uncertain. I think it is the hope of the leadership we can do so. The idea that the next two amendments that are already enshrined in the unanimous consent agreement should be exchanged today so each side can see them for debate tomorrow, in my view, is an excellent idea. 
   The subject of my amendment is one of the important and dramatic changes proposed in the bill reported by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is an amendment to the Straight A's portion of that bill. I will discuss Straight A's a little bit more in detail as we go forward today, but, fundamentally, Straight A's in the form in which it is found in this bill is a 15-State experiment available to 15 of the 50 States, pursuant to which roughly a dozen of the present categorical education programs--including, most notably, title I--would be combined and consolidated without the great bulk of the rules and regulations literally amounting to hundreds of pages and the forms and bureaucracy that accompany those rules and regulations. 
   There would, however, be one overwhelming requirement substituted for the procedural rules that accompany the present programs that are included in Straight A's. Those procedural rules have literally nothing to do with student achievement. They have to do with eligibility. They have to do with the nature in which the money coming through those programs is spent. They, of course, have as their goal student achievement. But most notably, the 35 years of title I have not been marked by any significant reduction in the difference between partially privileged student achievement and those of the underprivileged students, at which title I is aimed. 
   This amendment is slightly more than a technical amendment, but it  certainly does not change the philosophy of Straight A's. It has a more binding requirement; that the 15 States which take advantage of Straight A's actually reduce the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students by a minimum of 10 percent over the 5 years of the contract under which Straight A's is offered to those 15 States.

   Mr. GORTON. The penalties will be the same as they are in the original form of the bill; that is to say, if a State does not meet the commitments it made in getting into this 15-State Straight A's Program, it runs the risk, at the discretion of the Department of Education, of losing the ability to continue in that program. It would revert to the present system of categorical aid programs and the accountability provisions contained therein. 
   What this does is add another mandatory requirement to what the State undertakes, a 10-percent reduction in this differential. So it makes it somewhat tougher for the State to be entitled to continue in Straight A's after its initial 5-year period.

   Mr. GORTON. That question would be more properly directed to the Senator from New Hampshire who, I may say, I think disagrees with the Senator from Massachusetts as to his interpretation of the provisions of the Senator from New Hampshire. This provision, the 10 percent, applies to the Straight A's provision of the bill which, in turn, allows 15 States to have that degree of flexibility. It is very easy to talk about accountability from the point of view of punishing States and school districts by taking money away from them so that will increase, somehow or another, their performance. Part of our bill, in my view, is that the States who succeed will get a bonus, which is not included in the Democratic bill or in any previous education bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this has been already a remarkably substantive debate, with, I think, a clear delineation of education philosophies on each side. 
   The nature of the debate and the degree of heat that accompanies it has, I think, obscured one overwhelmingly important factor; that is, without exception, the Members on either side of the aisle have genuinely desired to improve the education system of the United States and desire a Federal participation that enhances that growth and that improvement. This, of course, is a wonderful characteristic of the debate where we are debating means and not ends. 
   As well, I hope, before the debate has concluded next week, or whenever we complete it, there will have been a reaching across the aisle that divides the two parties on proposals that do not unite everyone on both sides but at least will unite a sufficient number of Republicans and Democrats so that the last vote we take will be a vote on final passage of an education-related bill 
   that can take the next step toward reaching the goals in which all Members join. That is not to underestimate the differences between us. 
   I found the statement made by the Senator from Wisconsin to be particularly eloquent, even as I disagreed with almost all of its particulars. If I may be permitted to do so, I think I characterize the difference as being a difference which relates primarily to our degree of trust and confidence in men and women for whom education is both a profession and an avocation, men and women who spend their lives as educators, as teachers, as principals, and superintendents. 
   This debate also expresses a difference with respect to our trust and confidence in parents to seek the best possible education for their children, and in those men and women who share with Members of the Senate the willingness to suffer the slings and arrows of political campaigns often hotly contested but, in their case, running for membership on school boards across the United States, most of whom, unlike us, are not compensated or paid for the job they undertake. 
   The real difference--and it is a difference--illustrated by the relatively narrow two amendments before the Senate at the present time, one relating to Straight A's and the Democratic alternative, is the degree of trust and confidence we have in allowing those decisions to be made by people who know the names of the children they teach. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin has set out in detail his priorities, the clear implication being in every single case that if we don't set these requirements, the arts will be overlooked, underprivileged children will be overlooked, teacher training will be overlooked; that some amorphous blank check somehow or another will not be used for primary education purposes. 
   I find it difficult to understand this kind of difference. After all, the men and women who are voters in the United States, who voted for us, are the same voters who vote for these elected school board members who, in turn, employ the professionals in education. Why is it they elect Senators who are sensitive to all of these needs and school board members who are not? 
   One of the two subjects before the Senate now is Straight A's. It isn't the Straight A's that I started out with, by any stretch of the imagination, either when I introduced it under that name more than a year ago or when its precursor was voted on in this body some 3 years ago. It is, among other things, only an experiment limited to 15 of the 50 States in the United States of America. But for those 15 States, it says essentially, we trust you. We trust the education authorities in each one of these 15 States not only to use the money as wisely as we do in our categorical aid programs but more wisely. 
   However, in spite of the use of the phrase ``blank check,'' the check by no means is blank because in order to take advantage of Straight A's, in order to be one of these 15 States, the State must set up a testing system, an achievement system that measures how well its students are doing, must propose and sign a contract that the achievement level will rise as a result of their being allowed to use this experiment and that they risk losing this additional authority and trust if they do not meet the commitments they make in that original contract.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Massachusetts could not have asked a better question. He does remind me of the fact that he and I, with a number of other Senators in both parties, have had, over the course of last 2 or 3 years, a number of meetings in private to discuss whether or not we could reach just such an agreement. 
   We haven't reached it yet. That is obvious from our place on the floor of the Senate at this point. As I think he knows, negotiations involving at least some Republicans and some Democrats with that goal in mind continue at the present time. 
   I think it is the nature of our common humanity that we don't usually reach agreements on controversial issues until we are at the point of having to make final votes on these issues. I have every hope that we can. 
   In connection with the two proposals on the floor today, however, they state our dramatically opposing philosophies. My answer to the specifics of the question asked by the Senator from Massachusetts is very simple. He, it seems to me, is examining a beetle stuck in amber, a fossil from 35 years ago, with five examples out of 17,000 school districts today that he believes did not use money properly when they could use it as they desired. 
   But we have had 35 years of experience since then, with increased Federal controls, increased Federal mandates, increased numbers of forms to be filled out. And they have not succeeded, in title I, in reducing the disparity between underprivileged students and the common run of students who do not fall into that category. Yet we see the proposal on which we will vote later this afternoon, that side of the aisle saying the problem is not that we have too many rules, we have too few, and, where we had 100 pages of regulations, we need 200 pages of regulations. 
   While we can all say we wish for our schools better teachers, more teachers, more computers, and a number of other items, what we see in a proposal of categorical aid is each school district needs so many more teachers, each school district needs so many more teacher training programs, each district needs so many more hours of art instruction, for example, rather than saying within these broad categories each school district ought to be able to decide the balance among each of those primary needs. 
   We also see, obviously, that there should be some form of accountability. We believe we have the ultimate form of accountability, that in Straight A's, in that portion of this bill at least, we say the bottom line is: How well educated are your students after they finish this program? Is there an objective measurement of their educational achievement? Has that improved? That seems to me to be a policy accountability against the process accountability we have required, increasingly, in the course of the last several years.

   Mr. GORTON. I repeat the first half of my answer to the Senator from Massachusetts. I believe there are efforts--I hope he is a part of those efforts; I can assure him this Senator is--to reach just such an agreement in which each side would accommodate to some of the highest priorities of the other side, whether they are substantive or procedural with respect to accountability. 
   But I think the reason the differences are so great as against what they were 5 years ago, or 10 years ago, is that, if I may say so, on this side of the aisle there is a greater recognition that we are on a dead-end street, that 35 years of the kind of programs with increasing rules and regulations that have led us to this point simply have not worked. There is a greater disposition over here to say, at least in some States we ought to allow people to do something radically different from what they have before them. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts is 100-percent correct. Some States are far ahead of others, even with the degree to which their hands are tied by present Federal regulations. My profound fear is, if we allow even more differentiation, the next time we come to renew this act, we will have a far better understanding of what works in the real world and what does not work in the real world. 
   What I wanted to say, not only in connection with Straight A's but in  connection with title I portability, in connection with the Teachers' Empowerment Act, in connection with the Performance Partnership Act that comes to us from the Governors, that is a part of this bill, and of course in connection with Straight A's, none of these experiments, or these changes of direction, is mandated on any State of the 50 States in the United States of America. Any State education authority, any State legislature that does believe it is making more progress or will make more progress with essentially the present system--tweaked a little bit--is completely free to do so. Only 15 States can take Straight A's. I think at present only 10 States can take title I portability, plus a few other school districts.

   Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts. I do think they lent clarity to the debate in which we are engaged at the present time. I am fairly close to the conclusion of my remarks. 
   Again, it is essential for both Members and the public to understand that we are not mandating a change in the Federal system. We are enabling a change in the Federal system. We are enabling a combination of three or four or five changes in the Federal system. If I find any proposition difficult to understand, it is the proposition that somehow or another we know so much more about the subject than do the Governors and legislators of the various States, the elected school board members, and the full-time school authorities in 50 States and 17,000 school districts across the United States of America. 
   It is true that the virtue of humility is more highly praised than practiced. No place is that more true than it is here in the Senate. But it does seem to me that a little bit of humility about these education policies is very much in order here, a little bit more trust and confidence reposed in the people who devote their entire lives to this field of education--something that we do not. 
   The comments of the Senator from Massachusetts were very well placed and very thoughtfully stated. By the time we reach the end of this debate, I hope we will be in a position that we simply will not have all members of one party voting one way and all the members of the other party voting the other way. I hold that to be a very real possibility. 
   In the meantime, it is vitally important to make clear the distinction between those with all the eloquence of the previous speaker from Wisconsin whose goals I totally share but whose means I do not share at all, who sets out what he thinks are priorities the Congress is better able to set, not in general terms but in very specific terms, for every school district across America. 
   Our view is that we seek a better educated populace in the 21st century, children better prepared to deal with the marvelously complex challenges of that century by allowing our schools the greater right to innovate, a greater right to meet these challenges than we grant them at the present time. 
   The current manager of the bill and I represent the same State. While we disagree on these issues, we agree on the wonderful innovative things going on in the State of Washington at the present time. I simply wish to grant more scope to that innovation. I hope my State will be among the 15 because I trust the educators in my State and school board members in my State to make the right decisions about their children and about their schools. 
   I must say, I have no less confidence than the people who hold those positions in the State of the Presiding Officer across my eastern borders, or, in that case, the State of Massachusetts represented by my good friend. There at least is the debate. For tomorrow, I hope we have a greater degree of accommodation which does and must retain this degree of added authority, added trust, and added confidence in our school authorities.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for nearly 60 years, the citizens of the Tri-Cities in Washington state, Richland, Kennewick and Pasco, have worked to guarantee our nation's nuclear defense. Now it's time for the federal government to guarantee these citizens--and the rest of the Northwest--that the nuclear waste produced at Hanford will be moved to an adequate storage facility for permanent disposal. 
   The Hanford site contains 177 underground tanks full of radioactive and chemical byproduct waste. These aren't small tanks--some are as large as a four story apartment building, and, in toto, they hold 54 million gallons of waste: two-thirds of the nation's defense-related nuclear waste. This waste resulted from nearly 45 years of plutonium production at Hanford. Unfortunately, at least 66 of these tanks have exceeded their design life by thirty years and have leaked radioactive waste into the soil near the Columbia River. This problem is not going away. 
   We need a safe, permanent repository for this waste. We need the federal government to be focused on opening the repository. We need this nuclear waste legislation to become law. 
   Many of the opponents of this legislation are acting as if they do not want a solution to this problem at all. They would rather have commercial waste stored at reactors all around the country and defense waste stored in temporary structures, including the leaking underground tanks at Hanford. Delaying work on the repository is not the answer.  
   Continuing with the present situation is irresponsible. I urge an override of the President's veto of this nuclear waste legislation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if there were a secret poll taken in this body to determine an MVP, Most Valuable Player, my own suspicion is that would be the Senator to whom my own vote would go, the senior Senator from New Mexico, who has just spoken to us with such eloquence. He manages to work thoughtfully on the widest range of issues of any Member of this body that I know. The minute the debate on the budget resolution, with which he is charged, is over, he is on to another subject, whether it is energy or national defense or education or Social Security. It is a privilege to be his colleague. It is a privilege to be his friend. It is also a little bit difficult at times because after his introduction to this bill, this Senator, even as an author of the bill, can do nothing to improve on the remarks of the Senator from New Mexico but maybe only to rephrase them slightly and offer his support for them. 
   I think what we gain from this debate, from what the Senator from New Mexico has said, what we heard from the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from New Hampshire and others, is that there may not have been another instance in the last half dozen years on any major subject--perhaps the Senator from New Mexico might agree with me, with perhaps the exception of the debate on welfare reform--in which the old and the new were so magnificently and so dramatically contrasted as are the new, fresh ideas, fresh approaches to this problem outlined in this bill and outlined by its supporters as opposed to the passionate defense of the status quo by so many on the other side. 
   The Senator presiding and the Senator from New Mexico will 
    remember that was the essential division in the debate over welfare reform. We were told of all of the disasters that would take place if we dramatically reformed our welfare system. Now, a few years later, no one, for all practical purposes, can remember that he or she opposed that reform; it has been so magnificently successful. 
   Mr. President, I predict the same fate for this debate if, in fact, we are successful in carrying out the dramatic and innovative and constructive changes that are included in this bill. 
   We have heard basically two arguments from the other side of the aisle.

   Mr. GORTON. They are saying, essentially--and we have heard it on the floor of the Senate in the last hour--that we cannot trust the school authorities in any State in the United States of America, or any school district in any one of those States, to make these decisions on their own without guidance from this body acting as a sort of supernational school board.

   Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I will go back to what I see as two distinct currents of criticism from the other side. 
   The first of those is that if we have not reached the goals they set 35 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, we still have to keep running up against that same wall, and the reason we have not succeeded is that we have not imposed enough rules and regulations on schools all across the United States. So what we really need to do--they call it accountability--is to impose more rules and regulations on States and on school districts and on principals and teachers all across the United States to make sure they do exactly what we tell them to do. 
   I strongly suspect that any alternative they come up with will include dozens, if not hundreds, of additional rules and regulations to be imposed on our school districts. 
   There is a second element, a second part of their proposal, and that is if 12, 16, 74, 276 Federal education programs have not really done what they ought to have done, we need another half dozen programs. Again, in the last hour or so, we have heard of some new ways, some new Federal programs which we ought to authorize and on which we ought to spend money. 
   They make that proposition in spite of the dramatic point made by my friend from New Mexico that the most prescriptive of all of the Federal programs--the education for disabled act, the special education provisions--required us as long as almost 30 years ago to come up with 40 percent of the money. It is only in the last couple of years, with the efforts of Members on this side of the aisle, that it has cracked two digits and has reached 11 percent. 
   Instead of saying why don't we properly fund what we promised to fund in programs that carry with it a tremendous number of rules and regulations, why don't we do that? No, no, let's think of half a dozen new programs and let's not abolish any. 
   Now that I think of that last statement, I guess I have to amend it. They do want to abolish one, or at least the President wants to abolish one. He wants us to appropriate no money at all to the sole program in the present education bill which allows the States to spend the money on their own priorities without any controls from the Federal Government. It is a very modest part of our present education system--a very modest part. That is the only one the administration, and I suspect the other side, would just as soon abandon. 
   We, on the other hand, as the Senator from New Mexico points out, do not even go so far as to say we know everything, nothing is right with the present system, no one should be allowed to use it under any circumstances. Running from top to bottom through the proposal we have before this body right now is the right of any State's educational authorities who believe the present system is the best we can come up with to continue to follow it, to continue to use it, to continue to file all of the forms and abide by all of the rules and regulations of the present system. 
   All we are saying, modestly in some respects but I think quite dramatically in other respects, is that you are going to have a choice, education commissioners of the 50 States and, in many cases, the school districts of the several States; you can try a dramatic new system called Straight A's, or 15 of you--and I am very sorry it is only 15--can try a dramatic new program called Straight A's under which a dozen or a baker's dozen of the present education programs can be collapsed into a single program, rules and regulations thrown 
   out, forms tossed, administrators turned into teachers, as long as you make a legal commitment to one single goal: The kids in your State will get a better education and you will prove it by achievement tests that you design and that you agree will show that improvement over a period of 3 to 5 years. 
   Accountability under the present system means you have filled out all the forms correctly, you have made absolutely certain that you have not spent a dollar that we have said ought to be spent on one purpose for another education purpose or for another student, no matter how well, how validly you have spent that dollar. 
   Accountability under our system means our kids are better educated, they are better fitted to deal with the world in the 21st century. 
   In describing that choice under Straight A's, my friend from New Mexico omitted only one element, but it is an important element. That element is that as against the form of accountability the other side wishes, punishment--you are going to lose your money; you are going to lose your ability to make your own choices; you are going to be fined; or you are going to get a bad audit--we offer a carrot. We say that if after 35 years in which we have failed to close the gap between underprivileged students who are entitled to title I support and the other more privileged students, if you close that gap by raising the achievement of the underprivileged students, you will get more money; you will get a reward; you will get a bonus. 
   They never thought of that in connection with the present program. We do. We do have to supply some discipline, some loss of ability to make your own choices for States that are miserable failures, but we think it every bit as important, perhaps more important, to provide a reward for those systems that do the job right. 
   I must confess that I have a reservation about our own proposal in this connection. We are demanding a great deal because we are demanding that States, in order to get Straight A's, agree to a contract under which the performance of their students will improve, and they sign that contract in order to get control over 5 or 6 or 7 percent of the money they are going to spend on their students, the really modest contribution made by the Federal Government. 
   I would feel a lot more comfortable in the form of accountability we have designed ourselves if the demands we make were more directly proportional to the amount of money we are putting into the system. Even so, I believe there are a minimum of 15 States that will jump at this opportunity to get the Federal bureaucrats off their backs and to say, as we are saying here: Let the decision about what is best for the education of our students be made, by and large, by the people who know their names--the parents, teachers, and principals, and above them, their superintendents and their elected school board members. Let's no longer claim that we in Congress, that people downtown in the Department of Education know all of the answers, and that one set of answers fits every school district, no matter how rural or how urban, no matter west or east or north or south in the United States of America. 
   This bill goes beyond just Straight A's for 15 States. It has, as the Senator from New Mexico described, performance partnership agreements, a modified form of Straight A's, a form that still retains some of the rules and regulations, more than I would like, but also provides a far greater degree of choice and policy-setting authority to our local school boards and to our States and does have two great advantages: 
    One, it is strongly supported by the Governors--Republicans and Democrats--and, two, it is applicable to all of the States. 
   So, even at that level, some States will get three choices, and all will get two: Straight A's, performance partnership agreements, or the present system. 
   Beyond that, our proposal includes the Teacher Empowerment Act, which gives much more flexibility to the way in which we compensate our teachers, train our teachers, and determine what the requirements for those teachers are, and a very real degree of choice  with respect to title I, especially for failing schools, where instead of saying that title I is focused on schools and on systems, we will say, again, for those States and for those communities that wish to do so, title I will be focused on the individual students who are eligible, the underprivileged students who are eligible, so that they, and not the systems and not particular schools, will be the goals of title I. 
   Has the present title I been so successful that it cannot stand a change, even a change that offers an option to States and to individual school districts? That is what we hear from the other side of the aisle, that it would be terrible. We have 35-year-old reports cited concerning things that happened two generations ago as an argument against any kind of innovation today and as an argument for maintaining a system that, bluntly, has not worked, that has not worked at all. 
   At its most fundamental level, this is a debate about who knows best and who cares most: Members of this body and people working in the bowels of the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or those men and women all across the United States of America who are concerned about the future of their children, those men and women all across the United States of America who have dedicated their entire professional lives to providing that education for our children--their teachers and their principals and their superintendents--and those men and women across America who, in almost every case without compensation, have entered the political arena and have run for and have been elected to school boards in their various communities. 
   Our opponents of this bill say that none of these people should be trusted; only we should be trusted. We say we want to repose far more trust and confidence in those individuals all across the United States of America, we want to hold them accountable, but we want to hold them accountable on the basis of their results, and their results only. 
   That is what the debate will be about for the balance of this week and perhaps next week, as well.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to share with you an example of how local educators are using the innovations in the high tech field to improve our children's education. David Forrester, founder and director of the Learning Opportunities Center in Tumwater, Washington, has created a program that gives students with unique needs the opportunity to work at their own pace in an environment that teaches them new skills and encourages them to excel. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Mr. Forrester's outstanding work and give him my next Innovation in Education Award. 
   David Forrester is the mastermind behind the Learning Opportunities Center which has grown over the last six years and now supports 150 students ages 9 to 21 from high schools in nearly ten separate school districts. The Center supports students from extremely rural areas or who have struggled in the traditional education system. Through this center, students succeed and take courses in English, Math, and Science through a computer system specifically created for their needs. 
   With the help of grant money, Mr. Forrester has designed software which he has named Pathware. Pathware allows him to manage a large scope of curriculum and organize it to fit each student's needs. In essence, each student has their own personalized program that can help them work at their own level and pace in multiple subject areas, allowing him to maintain one-on-one relationships with his students. 
   Pat Cusack, the Coordinator of the School to Work program at the New Market Vocational Skills Center considers David Forrester to have, ``He's a man with a big heart who puts kids first with tireless energy and tremendous vision.'' 
   Shaun Rohr, a student of Mr. Forrester, has told me that because of the Learning Opportunities Center and Mr. Forrester's motivation, he has been offered a job in web-page design. Shaun says, ``Mr. Forrester is always there to help, and shows you different ways to approach a problem. At first I was not ready to learn web-page design, but Mr. Forrester kept asking me and showed me how. Without his belief in me and his patience with me, I probably would not have learned.''  
   I applaud the dedication and hard work of Mr. Forrester who has found new and creative ways to serve the needs of his students and I am proud to recognize his contributions and his persistence in carrying out his vision. By creating so many new options for children, Mr. Forrester is giving back to local schools and setting a wonderful example for those around him.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, next week when the Senate takes up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it will be dealing with the most important single issue, with the most vital single goal with which it will deal during the course of this session of Congress. That debate will be about our children, about their education, and about their future. 
   There is unanimous recognition in this body that a good education, an education for the 21st century, will help our children and our grandchildren have an economically independent future, to understand the history of their tradition and their culture, and will open to all of their lives an opportunity for lifetime learning and personal enrichment. 
   At the same time, as citizens, we recognize that the future of our democracy depends upon an educated citizenry and that we will need more and better educated people in an ever more complicated future. 
   This year alone, I have had an opportunity, both in person and through video conferencing, to visit dozens of schools in individual school districts in my own State, an experience I know many of my colleagues have shared. More than a year ago, we developed a system of recognizing on almost a weekly basis an outstanding educator or an outstanding program someplace in the State of Washington, to both recognize and reward the innovation, the new thinking we all approve but sometimes find difficult to discover. 
   Educators in my State--teachers, principals, superintendents, school board members--and thoughtful and involved parents are proud of their successes, but that pride is mixed with frustration, a frustration from the limitations placed on their ability to do what they think best for schoolchildren under their care because of the massive rules and regulations emanating from Washington, DC. Massive, I say, out of all proportion to the amount of money that comes to facilitate that education from sources in the District of Columbia. 
   With all the good will in the world, we now, for 35 years, have attempted to reduce the gap between underprivileged and normally privileged children through title I. The Federal Government has spent more than $100 billion to reach that goal. But, bluntly, the goal has not only not been reached, it has not even been approached. 
   We find in the country as a whole that two out of every three African American and Hispanic fourth graders can barely read. We find that 70 percent of children in high-poverty schools score below the most basic reading level. We find that fourth graders in high-poverty schools remain two or three grade levels behind their peers in low-poverty schools. 
   For these kids, and for the future of our country, we can do better. We must do better. How can we possibly argue that maintaining the present system, or by adding to its complexity by increasing the number of rules and regulations coming from Washington, DC, we can help these disadvantaged students in the light of this history, or help any of our other students, for that matter? 
   The status quo in the future will mean what the status quo in the past has meant. I am convinced--I hope all of us are convinced--that no child should be left behind. 
   For the last 3 years, I have worked on, spoken for, and proposed to this body, new and better approaches that are now a part of the bill we will be dealing with next week called Straight A's, to allow innovation in States and in local communities in school districts across the United States, and to serve those children who are left behind by the present system. 
   Straight A's would change the present pattern--unfortunately, in the form in which this bill appears before us in only 15 States; but in 15 very fortunate States--by giving them far more flexibility to use the money that comes from the Federal Government in the best interests of their children, without the blizzard of forms and paperwork that plagues our schools at the present time but with one overwhelmingly important underlined requirement: that the academic achievement of our children demonstrably improve on the basis of objective tests imposed by each of the States that take advantage of Straight A's. 
   Under Straight A's, States and local communities could target more dollars to high-poverty areas if they believe that is an effective use of the money. In a very real sense, they would be encouraged to do so or to change the system for the better because, for the first time, States and local school districts would be rewarded--tangibly rewarded--by receiving an increased appropriation if, and as, they reduce the gap between disadvantaged students and other students in their systems. 
   Right now there is no such incentive, simply hundreds of different categorical aid programs, many of them highly duplicative in nature, creating all kinds of bureaucracies that have succeeded in either getting dollars through to the classroom or in the far more important goal of raising student achievement. 
   Yesterday, at a news conference, the State superintendent of schools in Georgia said 50 percent of the money that her schools received from the Federal Government went to administrative costs--50 percent--a terrible indictment of the present system. That money should be found in our schools educating our children, not creating more paperwork and more forms. 
   The most dynamic forces in our schools today, in our education system today, are found in our States and in our local communities, not here in Washington, DC. Parents want a better education, and, Lord knows, those men and women who dedicate their entire lives to teaching our children--teachers and principals and superintendents--wish for exactly the same thing. 
   I am convinced that we can enable them, we can empower them, to provide a far more effective education system for all of our children than we are doing at the present time. 
   The way that we will provide that power, the way we will enable them, will be to trust them to make the right decisions, but in an expression borrowed from the cold war: Trust but verify. And we will verify. The only valid method of verification: A set of tests under which their actual objective achievement will be measured and reported here to Washington, DC, and to this Congress. 
   This should not be--and I hope will not be--a partisan issue. I am convinced that working together we can significantly improve our system of public education in the United States and significantly increase the participation--the constructive participation--that this body, the Congress, and the President, make to that. I hope next week will be the advent of debate that will have exactly those results.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday, a group of 22 Washington State senior citizens boarded a bus in Seattle and drove to British Columbia in Canada to purchase their prescription medicine. Collectively, those 22 individuals saved $12,000 by taking that bus ride--an average of more than $550 per individual. It is stories like this that have taken place over the last 2 or 3 years that bring me here today. 
   Every day, all across our northern and southern borders, Americans leave the U.S. in order to purchase products discovered, developed, manufactured, and sold in the United States, but substances, prescription drugs, that are far less expensive in Canada, Mexico, and for that matter, in the United Kingdom and across Europe than here in the United States. 
   My own office did an informal survey and found that for the ten most commonly prescribed drugs, prices in British Columbia average 60-percent less than prices for the identical drugs in the identical quantities in the State of Washington. These lower prices don't apply only in Washington State or in our northern border States. For example, Prozac, to treat depression, is 95 cents a pill in Mexico and $2.21 in the United States. The allergy drug, Claritin, costs almost $2 a pill in the United States and 41 cents in the United Kingdom. Rilutek, to treat Lou Gehrig's disease, costs $9,000 in the United States and $5,000 in France. 
   Now, it is simply unfair to impose these higher prices on citizens of the United States at the drugstore cash register, when the same drugs are being sold by the same companies at wholesale, at so much lower prices almost everywhere else in the world. 
   What is the reason for this price differential? It is a simple one. Each of these other countries imposes price controls on the price for which they allow their purchasers to pay. The American company, on the other hand, looks at the situation and says that price is too low to cover my costs of research and development, but I can impose all of the costs of research and development on American citizens. The marginal cost of manufacturing more pills and selling them in France, Mexico, or in Canada is really very small. So I can sell for half the price in Canada that I charge in the United States and still make a profit. 
   The company makes out just fine. The American citizen pays the price. The American citizen pays the price more than once because the American citizen has already paid roughly 50 percent of the cost of developing that drug through our tax system, either through direct appropriations at the National Institutes of Health or through various research and development tax credits. 
   Just on Sunday morning, the New York Times had an extensive article on a drug called Xalatan, which is used for glaucoma, an eye condition, developed by an NIH grant in the original instance at Columbia University, sold to an American drug company which did the rest of the research and development but sold today for one-third of the American price in Hungary, and barely half or a third of the American price in France and Canada and in the rest of the world. That is all due to the fact that these other countries are getting a free ride on the backs of American citizens, American purchasers, for the 
   research, development, marketing, and sale of these drugs. 
   Now, I have labored for the last 5 months to find an answer to this question, and my favorite answer to this question at this point is included in the bill. The bill is very simple. It builds on an almost 65-year-old precedent, which is the Robinson-Patman Act. In 1936, this Congress passed the Robinson-Patman Act and prohibited price discrimination, with very minor exceptions, in sales to U.S. purchasers from manufacturers and from wholesalers, designed originally to prevent the big chain company from getting such a price break from the manufacturer that it could drive its smaller competitors out of business. It simply prohibited that kind of price discrimination. 
   My bill amends that 65-year-old Robinson-Patman Act by extending that nondiscriminatory provision from interstate commerce to interstate and foreign commerce with respect to prescription drugs. Remember, this law has applied to our American drug manufacturers for 65 years, as far as their sales within the United States are concerned. Now, if my bill passes, it will apply to their sales overseas, outside of our country. That will spread the cost of research and development fairly across all of the purchasers, not just the American purchasers, and will inevitably result in lower prices for American prescription drug users, which is exactly what we ought to do. We will give the drug manufacturers not only the opportunity, but the requirement that they treat their American purchasers fairly, just as they have been required not to discriminate among American purchasers for more than six decades. 
   As you know, we are in the midst of a national debate over prescription drugs and, most particularly, over whether or not we should grant a prescription drug benefit to at least certain senior citizens who are the beneficiaries of our Medicare system. Just 2 weeks ago in this body, we voted on a budget resolution that authorizes up to $40 billion for such a drug benefit over the course of the next 5 years. I supported that budget resolution, and I will support what our proper committees report to us in response to that resolution. 
   That will benefit one distinct group of senior citizens, those whose income levels are low enough to benefit from this assistance in purchasing their prescription drugs. It will do absolutely nothing for other seniors. It will do nothing for the 44 million uninsured in the United States. It will do nothing for the costs of health care insurance--for those policies that prescribe prescription drug benefits and, therefore, have that cost reflected in the insurance premiums at all. In other words, as important as it is to certain seniors, it won't go to the heart of the problem--the high and increasing cost of prescription drugs. 
   Part of those high costs are due to the great success of our drug companies. More and more, a greater share of our health care dollars go to the prescription drug feature every year because they are now successful in treating conditions that previously could not be treated at all or required hospitalization. We should hail that progress. We certainly should support drug companies' research and development of new medicines, but we should not countenance discrimination against American citizens and against American purchasers by allowing those companies to sell precisely the same prescription in almost every other country in the world at prices half or less than half of what they sell them for in the United States. 
   I have been working on this proposition ever since a November 1999 cover story in Time magazine which first illustrated the stark nature of this problem and its costs. With all of this work and with my consultation over the last month with the drug companies themselves, which do not like my bill one bit, I have sought a goal. I am not wedded to a particular means. I think this bill is a good way to reach that goal, but it is not necessarily the only goal. I want the drug companies themselves to come up with an answer to this question. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle have introduced so-called ``reimportation'' bills, which I find relatively attractive though rather bizarre. At the present time, my senior citizens can go up to Canada, as they did yesterday, and buy a 3-month supply of prescriptions for their own personal use and bring them back to the United States. But the pharmacy in Bellingham, WA, can't go up to a wholesaler in Canada and get the lower Canadian price and pass it on to that pharmacy's customers in the State of Washington. That kind of reimportation is barred, even though we are talking about precisely the drug that the Bellingham pharmacy is now required to buy directly from the manufacturer. 
   Reimportation bills with certain limitations would lift that restriction and would allow the bizarre situation where the drugstore in the United States could purchase an American-manufactured drug in Canada for less than it could buy it for in the United States. I think that solution may very well be the direction in which we ought to go. I am also convinced that there are other ways of doing it. I will say  that the drug companies made a reasonable suggestion to me for a tiny bit of the problem.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will direct the U.S. Trade Representative for the next year to negotiate fairer and more equal prices from foreign governmental purchasers, and, in the absence of success of doing so, make specific statutory recommendations to this Congress. 
   This is a proposal the drug companies themselves suggested to me. I regard it as a constructive proposal, but not as a solution to the problem standing alone. But it is a tangible result of the course I have already charted, and one that came as a result of my communication with drug companies of my concerns and the earlier draft of the bill I am introducing today. 
   The problem is a very simple one. American citizens are paying too much for prescription drugs because our companies are allowing foreign purchasers to pay too little for exactly the same drugs. At the very least, American citizens who have spent so much of their tax money in financing the research and development of these drugs should not be paying more than purchasers in other countries. 
   That is the goal of each of the two bills I am introducing today, but what I really want and what the American people really want is a solution and answer to this problem.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, next Monday is the deadline for all Americans to file their 1999 income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. This week the Senate has appropriately dedicated its attention to the tax burden placed on Americans, particularly the unfair marriage tax penalty. Simply, the marriage tax penalty is an injustice in the current Federal income Tax Code that results in a married couple filing a joint tax return paying more in taxes than if the same couple were not married and filed as individuals. 
   Every week of the year I receive letters from Washington state constituents outraged by the marriage tax penalty, but during tax season my mailbox is deluged with the protests of married couples. Last year, Congress passed a tax relief bill that would have eliminated the marriage penalty, but President Clinton vetoed this needed reform. This year, Democrats have spent this entire week delaying and then blocking a Senate vote on a bill to end the marriage penalty. 
   Maybe some of my colleagues should hear what I read in the letters I receive asking for action by Congress and the President to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. From an email I received from a constituent in Maple Valley, Washington: ``I wanted to express my hope that you and the other members of Congress will be able to eliminate the marriage penalty tax.*.*.*.Why should I pay more in taxes since I am married?'' From Bellingham, Washington: ``Fairness! It all comes down to fairness. Please stop penalizing us for being married. We deserve the same as two single taxpayers.'' From a family farmer in Eastern Washington state: ``I believe the marriage tax penalty is a mistake that should be corrected. It would establish fairness in our tax system.'' This is merely a sampling of the hundreds of letters I have received, but it is an accurate representation of the views of my constituents and the vast majority of Americans. 
   My No. 1 tax legislative priority is complete tax reform. I believe the entire confusing and incomprehensible Tax Code should be scrapped and replaced with a system that is fair, simple, uniform and consistent. Until such fundamental reform can take place, I will continue to work in support of tax reform and relief measures that correct unfair aspects of the existing tax code mess. The marriage tax penalty is absolutely one of the most outrageous and indefensible injustices in the current Tax Code. Efforts to delay and block the elimination of the marriage tax penalty are clearly an affront to a sense of fairness, the institution of marriage, and they are contrary to the desires of an overwhelming majority of Americans. The Senate should vote now to correct the marriage tax penalty.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there are, in my view, two remarkable aspects to the budget resolution conference report before the Senate this afternoon. 
   The first is, I believe for only the third or fourth time since the Budget Act was passed, the promptness with which the Senate is dealing on a final basis with a budget resolution that is the springboard from which we will do the substantive work of the appropriations for the balance of this year. For that promptness, for the efficiency with which the Senate has dealt with this issue, we owe our deepest and sincerest thanks not only to the chairman of the committee, my friend, PETE DOMENICI, but to the staff who have labored so long and so hard on a highly technical and complicated task. 
   More significant perhaps than the significance of finishing our work on time is the substantive nature of this budget resolution. It is exquisitely balanced among three separate needs: The need to adequately fund those programs that are already major responsibilities of the Federal Government; the need to provide for additional programs of considerable interest, the most significant of which being the Medicare program about which Senator DOMENICI spoke earlier, but also including priorities with respect to education--particularly close to my heart--and to our national defense. 
   The second substantive element of this budget resolution is the dramatic reduction in the national debt it will cause. It is only a short period of time since we were discussing how we could reduce annual national deficits of upwards of a quarter a trillion a year. Now we face the equally difficult but far more pleasant prospect of paying off the national debt at a very substantial rate. 
   The third element in this budget resolution is the opportunity to provide tax relief for hard-working Americans who pay taxes. The chairman of the committee, Senator DOMENICI, pointed out the importance of the bill, which regrettably was subjected to a filibuster earlier today, to end the unconscionable penalty against married Americans, both of whom are at work. The thought that a couple in love, even in relatively modest professions, should pay a penalty for getting married rather than receiving the approbation of society for doing so is bizarre. To have the ability to provide for that marriage tax penalty relief, amounting, as the chairman pointed out, to almost half of the allowed tax relief in the bill, is a vitally important part of this budget resolution. 
   As the chairman himself pointed out, if for some reason we cannot pass tax relief, or if for some reason we pass a tax relief bill that is vetoed by the President, then that money should go to further pay down the national debt. Regrettably, many of the Members on the other side, as evidenced by their actions just a week ago when we were debating this issue on the floor of the Senate, would prefer to spend it. I suspect if we added up the expenditures contained in all of their unsuccessful amendments, we not only would have spent the entire general fund surplus, but we would have once again eaten into the Social Security surplus as well. 
   In summary, we have a budget resolution that allows us adequately to fund the functions of government. It allows us to meet some new needs and desires of the American people. It allows us modest but still significant room for tax relief. It makes dramatic payments on the national debt. 
   For each and every one of those reasons, we not only owe our thanks to the chairman of the Budget Committee and to his staff, I believe we owe our votes in favor of the resolution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GORTON. Every April, Americans are reintroduced to the beauty of Spring by blooming tulips, green lawns, and the 5.5 million word federal income tax code. 
   As every citizen wrestles with the complexity and incomprehensibility of the mammoth tax code to file his or her return by the April 15th (April 17th this year) annual deadline, there is virtually universal agreement that change is desperately needed. I believe that amending the tax code is not enough. I believe that we must scrap the entire tax code--it is too complicated, too burdensome, too unfair. 
   How complicated is the tax code? Here are some illustrative facts and figures. The current federal income tax system was born in 1913 as a law under 100 pages in length. The original 1040 form covered two pages, front and back. This included instructions. Today, the 1040 form has 76 pages of instructions alone. The most basic tax form today, the EZ1040, has 33 pages of instructions. 
   The annotated tax code fills 14 volumes of some 11,700 pages, and it takes an additional 19 volumes totaling another almost 11,750 pages to contain the regulations governing the code. To implement the code, the Internal Revenue Service prints over 400 forms and more than 100 pamphlets with instructions on how to complete these forms. 
   We need to focus our attention in Congress on developing a new tax system, and we need the President to support changing the current tax code, instead of defending it from reform. Fundamental reform of the tax code is my number one tax priority and I believe a new federal tax system must be based on four principles: fairness, simplicity, uniformity and consistency. 
   My support for tax reform should not be interpreted as opposition to providing tax relief to American families and working individuals who are sending more of their paycheck to the federal government in taxes than at almost any point in our nation's history. I absolutely support allowing people to keep more of the money they earned, and am pleased that the budget resolution adopted by Congress allows for a responsible reduction in taxes of $150 billion over the next 5 years, rather than the $13 billion tax increase for next year that the Clinton-Gore Administration proposed in their budget. The budget plan will allow Congress to consider several tax relief measures that not only reduce the tax burden on Americans, but also make the tax code simpler and more fair. 
   Congress has already passed legislation to repeal the Social Security Earnings Limit that penalized working seniors one dollar of Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn over the limit of $17,000. Congress is engaged in a debate to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Eliminating the estate, or death, tax is not only a priority of mine and many in Congress, it is a priority for small business owners and family farmers whose very existence is threatened by this disgraceful tax. 
   Americans deserve a tax code they can understand and predict. About the only thing Americans can predict about the current tax code is that every April they will likely be sending a big check off to Uncle Sam, and about the only thing they understand is that the IRS will find them if they do not. This must change and it is why I am working for a new tax system that is fair, simple, uniform and consistent. A new code based on these four principles will free Americans from suffering through the forms and tax tables of April tax season, and allow them to enjoy the blossoms and sunshine of the April Spring season.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during this week prior to the April deadline for filing income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service, Congress often focuses on the high tax burden shouldered by American families and the need for tax reform. Fundamental reform is my top tax legislative priority. I believe the entire confusing and incomprehensible tax code should be scrapped and replaced with a system that is fair, simple, uniform and consistent. Until such fundamental reform can take place, I will continue to work in support of tax reform measures that correct unfair aspects of the existing tax code mess. 
   One section of the code that I believe needs to be changed and changed soon is Section 415. Section 415 of the tax code was enacted in 1974 for the purpose of limiting the pensions of corporate executives. Section 415 no  longer impacts corporate executives, but it does unfairly impact middle income workers who are prevented from collecting the full pensions they earned and deserve from their multi-employer plan. This is as simple as the tax code keeping workers from being able to collect their own money. I believe this injustice should be corrected, and I have cosponsored legislation, Senate bill 1209, that will restore fairness to this section of the tax code. 
   The Senate version of the 1999 tax relief bill included the fix to Section 415. I am pleased that the Senate joined me in recognizing the absolute need to correct Section 415 and to stop unfairly punishing workers by blocking access to their hard-earned pensions, though I am disappointed that this change did not become law last year. It was, however, an important step towards achieving reform. As the nation focuses on tax season, I reaffirm my dedication to fighting to pass legislation to bring fairness to Section 415 of the tax code and ensure our nation's workers collect what they have rightfully earned.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, American consumers are feeling the impact of high oil prices. Obviously, the increase is noticeable at the gas pump, but it also is being felt in less visible ways through increases in the cost of goods and services as airline prices and shipping costs escalate. I have stated, in no uncertain terms, that I consider responsibility for the current situation largely to lie at the feet of the Clinton-Gore Administration. Thanks to nearly eight years of their short-sighted policies, we are increasingly dependent on foreign oil. To make matters worse, not only does the Clinton-Gore Administration not have any clear plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, they actually appear to be moving in the opposite direction, seeming at every turn making it more difficult to develop domestic energy sources, whether it be gasoline, petroleum products, coal, oil, or hydropower. 
   As it is largely through the bungling efforts of the current Administration that we are in this situation, I believe it is appropriate that the U.S. Senate counterbalance their efforts with some modest relief. A suspension of the 4.3-cent federal fuel excise tax, imposed in the early days of the Clinton Gore administration, should provide the short term relief consumers deserve. 
   As Congress addresses these issues, however, we must seek a solution that not only attacks this problem from the perspective of energy supply, but also energy use. A key aspect of any debate on this subject must focus on motor vehicle fuel consumption. The United States currently uses about 17 million barrels of oil per day to run cars and trucks. Thanks to the existence of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, three million barrels of oil are conserved each day. Despite the clear success of CAFE standards,  however, Congress has prevented the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from even considering whether we can do better, particularly in relation to the fuel efficiency standards of lights trucks, which haven't been significantly increased in ten years. 
   Many constituents and colleagues are often surprised to learn of my advocacy for CAFE standards. My motivation is simple, and is based on the success of the original CAFE statute. I feel that NHTSA should at least be allowed to study whether an additional increasing CAFE standards is an appropriate action. As you may know, light truck standards have not had a significant increase in the last ten years. Light trucks are regulated separately from cars and are only required to get 20.7 mpg on fleet average as opposed to 27.5 for cars. In 1983, the average fuel economy of light trucks was already 20.7 mpg. Since 1983 it has dropped .3 mpg to 20.4. This is hardly a technological breakthrough. 
   I am not swayed by doomsday predictions from automakers who claim they will be forced to manufacture fleets of subcompact cars. These are the same arguments that were used during the original debate in 1974. One only needs to examine the possible options available to consumers today to disprove this theory. When consumers can purchase SUVs as large as the Chevy Suburban or Ford Excursion, it is hard to argue that consumer choice has been compromised. I have complete faith in American automobile manufacturers that they can continue to produce fuel efficient vehicles that are the envy of the world. 
   Therefore, it was with great interest that I listened to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson testify before the Interior Subcommittee this morning on the Clinton Administration's multi-faceted plan to address high gasoline prices. This testimony focused on a lengthy discussion of the results of last month's diplomatic efforts. When pressed on the Administration's plan to decrease this country's dependence on foreign oil sources, Secretary Richardson went on to tout his proposals to improve alternative fuel options and fuel efficiency. He suggested tax incentives and credits for U.S. oil producers, fuel efficient vehicle production, and alternative fuel development. Unfortunately, there was no mention of CAFE standards. 
   In response to this omission, I had to ask why this Administration has failed to actively support new fuel efficiency standards. When I pressed Secretary Richardson to commit to making CAFE standards a centerpiece of the Clinton-Gore Administration's effort to address the current fuel shortage and long-term foreign oil dependency of this country, he ducked the question and told me he wished the EPA Administrator was available to answer. 
   I am perplexed by this response. Obviously, U.S. auto manufacturers have demonstrated they are more than up to the challenge of producing more fuel efficient light trucks and SUVs. In fact, Ford Motor Company just announced plans to start selling within three years a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered SUV that gets about 40 miles per gallon. 
   Therefore, I fail to understand why the Clinton-Gore Administration can't make simply studying a possible increase in CAFE standards a top priority in this debate. I challenge the White House to embrace this common sense approach, which is certainly preferable to the groveling diplomacy it engaged in just weeks ago.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the past seven years, the children at  Franklin Middle School in Yakima, Washington have benefitted greatly from the dedication and hard work of their principal, Mr. Rick Otto. He has been credited by his colleagues for turning the school around with his new ideas, helping disadvantaged students, and creating a positive atmosphere. I applaud Principal Otto's work to bring about such important changes and improvements in his school and am proud to present Principal Otto with my next ``Innovation in Education'' Award. 
   Principal Otto has a distinguished record of service at Franklin Middle School. For many years, he taught technology classes before working as an assistant principal. In 1993, he became the principal and realized that in order to improve Franklin Middle School, the community would have to become more involved. Throughout his tenure, Principal Otto has built a strong relationship with parents, community leaders and residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. The work of Principal Otto and the community has made a tremendous impact resulting in a renewed sense of discipline and higher expectations in student performance. 
   One of the challenges taken on by Principal Otto was improving the academic achievement of its high-concentration of non-English speaking families as well as helping students traditionally described as disadvantaged. Under Mr. Otto's leadership, Franklin created an ``At-Risk'' program which targets the children who are having trouble in school, gives them more attention in the classroom, and monitors their improvement. In the past five years, 69 percent of the students participating in the ``At-Risk'' program have improved in all areas of their education. The ``At-Risk'' program has also vastly improved the morale of students and staff across the Franklin campus. 
   I have heard many words of praise from members of the Franklin Middle School community who regard him as a model educator and admire his steadfast dedication to his students. Their words speak more highly of Principal Otto than I, as a United States Senator, ever could. 
   Clearly, Principal Otto is a leader in the field of education who recognizes the challenges that exist in his school and works each day to meet those challenges and make his students better learners. I applaud Principal Otto and know that the past, present and future children attending Franklin Middle School will be better students because of him.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in a continuing effort to recognize excellence in education I would like to award Darvin Ecklund of the Cedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning Center in Port Orchard, Washington with an `Innovation in Education' Award. Two years ago, Mr. Ecklund, a Natural Resources teacher at Cedar Heights Junior High, created an after school center that focuses on environmental activities and teaches students the importance of rehabilitating our local natural resources. I think Mr. Ecklund's concept is a remarkable after school option for junior high students as an alternative, safe environment where they can learn and have fun at the same time. 
   The focus of the Cedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning Center aims to stimulate kids toward saving the environment around them. Recently, the Center renovated local ponds and developed plant life to be used in future rehabilitation projects. Children learn to identify common and scientific names of plants and wildlife. To date, over six hundred salmon have been raised in this Center! This is a truly remarkable way to integrate science into children's lives with a hands on approach. 
   We all know that we live in a busy world where sometimes kids end up waiting for their parents to return from work. I cannot think of a better way to see kids spend a few hours after-school, as well as getting parents involved in their children's after-school activities. Currently, there are over one hundred kids participating in this program. High school students are also part of Mr. Ecklund's staff and help organize activities and provide assistance as well. 
   Mr. Ecklund has also found a way for kids at the Cedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning Center to develop a relationship with the retirement community across the street. The Center offers retirees an educational as well as relaxing place to come and share time with the students. The Center has made the paths around the Environmental Center wheel-chair accessible. After hearing this, I was encouraged that this community has found a way to connect young people not only to the environment, but to their elders. I applaud Mr. Ecklund for creating such an innovative program that connects older and younger students to helping the environment and spending time with seniors. 
   Ms. Pat Green, Principal of Cedar Heights Junior High, said the following about Mr. Ecklund: ``He is passionate about the environment and teaching kids how to raise fish as a sustainable resource. The kids are learning hands-on science in action!" 
   Mr. Pat Oster, Assistant Principal of Cedar Heights Junior High commends Mr. Ecklund's efforts, describing him as, ``a very caring and energetic person who devotes generous time to the many students he interacts with on a daily basis.'' 
   I have been a long supporter of preserving the environment. I am impressed by the originality of this program and hope other after-school centers will follow in the footsteps of the Cedar Heights Environmental Resources Learning Center. This is truly science in action!

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have listened with great care to the Senator from Connecticut paradoxically claiming that to create a half dozen new categorical education aid programs and keeping control over all of them, to enable the U.S. Department of Education to write a few hundred pages more of rules and regulations, somehow or another enhances local control. 
   Mr. President, that is an Alice in Wonderland argument. A debate that will be at the heart of education will take place in this body next month when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes to the floor. By a regrettable partisan vote, that committee has proposed an Elementary and Secondary Education Act renewal that gives more promise to increase the academic performance of our students than has any other educational debate in this body for a decade or more. 
   On one side, including the chairman of the committee whose bill that is before us, are those who believe in true education reform and the kind of innovation that focuses not on how well teachers and superintendents and principals fill out Federal forms but on how well our students actually do. On the other side is the attitude that the Federal Government knows best and that somehow or other men and women all across the United States of America--parents and teachers and principals and superintendents and elected school board members, most of them working without compensation--somehow or other don't know or don't care what is best for their kids and we have to provide them with guidance. 
   Recently on this issue, one of my colleagues said that if we give these local communities the right to set their own education priorities, they will likely use the money for ``building a new locker room or redecorating office space.'' 
   On hearing this charge, one of my superintendents, the superintendent of the Oak Harbor School District, had this to say:  
   School boards are very close to their constituencies. Probably more than any other type of governing body, they are sensitive to the needs and demands of their communities. After all, they see their constituents on a daily basis at grocery stores, soccer fields and dance concerts. A parent can easily influence all five of our board members. Ten parents can move mountains locally. By contrast, what influence would these same people have on the education department, or even Congress? The best opportunity to avoid wasteful expenditures of education funds is at the local level where individual citizens have the greatest power and influence.  
   Yet what do we have from the minority party in the health committee on this request? Twenty new Federal education programs. We already have teacher training programs, to early childhood programs, to programs for delinquent and at-risk youths. They offered these new programs in that committee even though the General Accounting Office finds that we already fund 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs in 15 Federal agencies and departments, 86 teacher training programs in 9 Federal agencies and departments, and more than 90 early childhood programs in 11 Federal agencies and departments. But, according to them, we need 20 more to be added to all of these. 
   Our view, to the contrary, is just this. We should allow our States and local education agencies to make the determinations of how best to use this money, and we should hold them accountable in only one way so the students actually do better. 
   We have offered three alternatives. One is that any State that likes the present system, that believes it is perfectly all right to fill out these forms, that doesn't mind a bureaucracy with hundreds of different education programs, can continue to do it the way they do it today. Any State that likes the present system can continue it. 
   Fifteen States will be allowed the opportunity under Straight A's simply to take all of the money, give 95 percent of it to the school districts in the same proportion they get it today, and be accountable only for the performance of their students. And all of the other States will be allowed the program proposed by the National Governors' Association, both Democrats and Republicans, that would require title I money at least to go directly down to the school district in exactly the amounts that it does today. 
   For 35 years under title I, we have attempted to reduce the disparity between title I-eligible students and the more privileged students who are not eligible for title I. That disparity has not increased. For the first time in these programs, we are actually offering an incentive--more money to those States that work to decrease the disparity and show they have actually been successful. 
   There is, unfortunately, a great gulf between the two sides on this issue. The one side likes the present system and, in fact, apparently believes we need more than 127 programs for at-risk and delinquent youths, more than 90 early childhood 
   programs, more than 86 different and distinct teacher training programs, more forms from the Federal Government and from the bureaucracy, and less trust in the ability and interest of either State officials or local school officials in making the determination as to what our children need to succeed. 
   That is simply wrong. The men and women who know our children's names know best what they need to succeed in  education. The accountability we set out for them in our proposal is the most fundamental accountability of all. It is: To see to it that your students do better, come up with a system of tests that show whether or not they are succeeding in their academic subjects, and if they do succeed, you will go forward with this flexibility; you will in fact get more money. 
   The difference is striking. It is a great contrast. But those who believe in local control will allow the people in our States and communities to have that control, and we will not tell them they have to spend their time filling out forms and following hundreds of pages of Federal regulations. 
   There is a great gulf between the two sides in this debate. But our side is the one that believes in the future of our children and believes the future can best be determined by their parents, by their teachers, and by their elected school board members at home. 
   To go down the road putting more money into a failed system is to put new wine in old bottles. The bottles will simply burst and the wine be wasted.

   Mr. GORTON. Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to sit down and listen to military retirees during their veterans service organizations' annual visit to Washington, DC. Without exception, access to health care was a priority for each and every group. As a retired officer in the Air Force Reserve, I understand the interest in and importance of this issue to those who dedicated a career to serving and defending our Nation--I speak not only of the service members themselves, but their spouses and dependent family members as well. 
   After listening to retirees' personal stories and policy presentations, as well as reading the numerous letters on health care legislation I receive each week from military retirees across Washington State, I am convinced that Congress, the President and the Department of Defense must address the issue of retirees' access to health care. In response to the requests of my military retiree constituents, I am cosponsoring Senate bills 915 and 2003, the ``Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act.'' 
   In the past several years, I cosponsored and supported efforts to establish the Medicare subvention demonstration program, now known as Tricare Senior Prime, and the FEHBP demonstration program. The Tricare Senior Prime demonstration program allows Medicare-eligible retirees to receive care at military facilities with Medicare paying the Department of Defense for the costs of that care. Some retirees in my State of Washington have been able to participate in the Tricare Senior Prime demonstration program as Madigan Army Medical Center was one of the designated test sites. I have spoken with the Commanding Officer at Madigan, my staff has met at length with those overseeing the test at Madigan, as well as the participating retirees, and it appears the test is a significant success. 
   Two concerns I have heard about the Tricare Senior Prime program are that this is a demonstration and is scheduled to end in December of this year, and that Medicare's current reimbursement scheme to the Defense Department will not fiscally support a permanent program. Senate bill 915 will make the Tricare Senior Prime test program permanent and expand it nationwide to facilities not in the test. It is important for the Defense Department and Congress to act to ensure Tricare Senior Prime demonstration program does not expire at the end of this year and I will be working hard to ensure Tricare Senior Prime is maintained. I also intend to work to see that Medicare fairly reimburses the Defense Department so that the costs of the Tricare Senior Prime program do not impact the services' ability to care for active duty service members and their families. 
   Senate bill 2003, sponsored by Senators TIM JOHNSON, PAUL COVERDELL, and 24 other Senators, would entitle all retirees, and their widow or widower, access to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP), to which all federal non-military retirees have access. As I stated previously, I supported establishing the current FEHBP demonstration program. My support for the demonstration and my decision to cosponsor this bill is driven, to a great degree, by the fact that there are many retirees who do not live in close proximity to a military treatment facility, some due to base closures that shut down facilities in their area of the country. This legislation would provide retirees access to health care regardless of where they choose to live. S. 2003 will also expand access to Tricare to allow Medicare-eligible retirees. 
   One other issue that I know is of considerable concern to military retirees is the cost of prescription drugs. This concern is heightened, in a border State like Washington, by the disparity in drug prices between the United States and Canada--an issue on which I am working for a common-sense, straight-forward solution. Of interest to Medicare-eligible retirees is access to prescription drugs from DoD facilities or a mail-order program. I believe that it is only fair and appropriate for Congress to consider military retirees when debating the creation of a Medicare prescription drug benefit, which I support. 
   My cosponsorship of Senate bill 2003 and 915 is driven by the firm belief that Congress must address the current health care situation of military retirees. The President and Defense Department must be active participants in this matter. Military retirees dedicated their lives to defending our Nation and protecting our interests around the world--they are due a serious legislative response.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday, a bus load of seniors traveled from Seattle to Canada to buy prescription drugs. Just a short drive from where these seniors live, they can buy the medicine they need to stay healthy for much lower prices than they would pay at their neighborhood pharmacy.  
   Why? Because our own U.S. manufacturers sell exactly the same product to Canadian pharmacies for much less than the price they charge drug stores in the United States. Americans end up going to Canada and Mexico in order to afford to buy products that were discovered, developed and manufactured in America. Shocking? Yes. But every day U.S. based drug companies sell identical FDA approved, U.S. manufactured products in Canada and Mexico at discount prices unavailable to American purchasers in the United States. 
   Here are a few examples: 
   The Pecks from Tacoma, Washington recently saved $600 by going to Canada to buy a three month supply of blood pressure, stomach and sinus medications. Tomaxifen to treat cancer costs $15 for a one month supply in Canada and $95 a month in Vermont. Prozac to treat depression, is just .95 cents a pill in Mexico and costs $2.21 in the United States. 
   These price differences are by no means unusual. I was astounded to learn that for the top ten most commonly prescribed drugs, average prices are 64 percent lower in Canada than in Washington state.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Let me repeat--64 percent lower. That is outrageous. 
   A major reason for this disparity is that foreign governments have implemented price control policies that tempt--successfully I may say--U.S. drug companies to discriminate against American consumers. Other countries offer to pay the nominal costs of manufacturing a drug, some profit and little else. Our drug companies agree because they can still make a profit, leaving our citizens to pay the high costs associated with research and development of new drugs. And where has the Clinton/Gore Administration been? In my opinion it has done a wholly inadequate job of protecting Americans from this form of price discrimination--it simply ignores the problem. 
   I believe it is time to change the law so that Americans are no longer discriminated against with respect to the cost of prescription drugs. The best way I know to do that is to prevent drug companies from selling any product in Canada or Mexico at a lower price than they sell it for in the United States. 
   These are the principles found in the Robinson-Patman Act, a law Congress passed more than 60 years ago to address price discrimination in the United States. That act simply tells manufacturers that they can't act to undermine one business by selling the same product to a competitor at discounted rates, unless the price difference is due to legitimate quantity discounts. 
   What will this proposal mean? Once drug companies have the incentive to charge non-discriminatory prices overseas and other countries pay a fare share of drug research and development costs--people in Washington state and across the country will pay lower prices for prescription drugs. 
   Let me speak briefly about what I am not trying to do. I am not telling drug companies what price they have to charge for their product. I am simply saying that manufacturers can no longer discriminate against American consumers by charging Canadian and Mexican pharmacies lower prices than they charge Americans for precisely the same product. 
   It is not my intent to harm the research going on in the U.S. Drug companies should be able to recoup the research and development costs for both unsuccessful and successful new drugs. But my constituents in Washington and other Americans should not be forced to pay all of those costs for the rest of the world. 
   I have talked to seniors, doctors and others in our health care system about these pricing problems, but I wanted to hear from the industry as well. So last week, I asked the President of PhRMA and representatives from most of the big drug companies why Americans pay more than people in Canada or Mexico for the same exact drug. They told me that they shared my concern that American consumers pay most of the research and development costs associated with making new medicines. I was pleased to hear that we were on common ground in that area. 
   Unfortunately, I was left with the impression that the pricing issue is not a top concern to the drug companies. Instead of engaging me in a real discussion about the pricing issue and the vast difference between the cost of drugs in Canada and the cost of drugs here, I learned about the companies' commitment to having drug coverage extended to Medicare beneficiaries. They have a point on that issue, and I am working with my colleagues on such an extension. 
   But still this so-called solution is just one piece of the puzzle. Expanding Medicare coverage will help some people, but it doesn't help everyone, and it seems more like an effort by the drug companies to increase their markets at high prices, as opposed to dealing head on with policies that encourage them to charge Americans more for prescription drugs than they charge people in Canada and around the world. 
   While I did not hear much about this issue in my meeting, or in the days following our meeting, I still want to hear from the drug companies on this question. It is a vital one that needs to be addressed, and since they are the experts on this matter, I hope that they will come to me in the next few days with alternative ideas for correcting this injustice. It may well be that there is a better idea than my own. If so, I am anxious to hear it from the drug companies or from anyone else. One company incidentally has already made a constructive suggestion. 
   Fortunately, I have also heard from several of my colleagues on this idea, and the news is good for American families frustrated by this inequity. Several Republican Senators have committed to supporting my idea and the majority leader has expressed interest. I suggest that this is serious incentive for the drug companies to develop some ideas. Otherwise, I am prepared to introduce my proposal promptly.  
   Let me be clear that I recognize the importance of biopharmaceutical research. Some of the 
   cutting-edge research going on today may one day open up new avenues of science that will help crack the code of complex human illness and aid in finding treatments and cures for those in need of improved medicine. The United States is the global leader in biotechnology. As we work on proposals to help the American consumer afford prescription drugs, I will be mindful of the fact that we don't want to undermine this important industry. 
   That said, the current system hurts a lot of people, and leaves a lot of Americans feeling ripped off. The list of those who are discriminated against because of these unfair pricing policies includes the 40 million Americans who are uninsured and those seniors without drug benefits who pay higher prices at the drugstore cash register than just about anyone else in the world. It affects the cost of health care insurance and also is a growing problem for our doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes as more of the total of health care spending is allocated to drug costs. 
   The other group that gets hurt is the drug companies themselves. Because of these backward pricing policies, the drug companies have become the new ``health care villains.'' In my State, I hear constantly from constituents who rail against the drug companies for charging them hundreds of dollars more than what they would pay in Canada. For years, the drug companies were respected for their innovative products, the risk they were willing to take to improve our health, and the medical advances they created. Those good feelings have been earned, and while they have not been destroyed, that reputation is at risk by the companies' unwillingness to step forward on the pricing issue. 
   And specifically, their reputation is at risk when they do not speak out loudly against policies that cause harm to their very best customers--American families. 
   I hope they will speak out. But Congress can no longer allow other countries to get away with policies that force drug companies to discriminate against American consumers by charging dramatically lower prices in Canada and Mexico and thus higher prices here at home. Other countries must pay a fair share of the research and development costs for new drugs. Seniors, the uninsured, and every other American should be able to walk into their neighborhood drug stores and buy the medicines they need at affordable prices.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, throughout my great State of Washington, there are thousands of gifted students who need some extra time and attention to help further their talents. At Skyline Elementary in Ferndale, a teacher by the name of Greg Hart, has turned a program created by the school district into a tremendous success and created an environment where gifted students can excel. For his achievements with gifted students in the Aiming High program, I am proud to award him with my next ``Innovation in Education'' Award. 
   The Aiming High program consists of students from all over the Ferndale School Districts for gifted students in the top 1 to 2-percent of the district and was created by the Ferndale School District to encourage highly capable students to develop critical thinking and analytical skills, act responsibly and respectfully, and promote positive self-esteem. Mr. Hart's classes consists of fifth and sixth grade students. 
   Both the Ferndale Superintendent and Skyline Principal believe that Mr. Hart is the driving force behind the success of this program. One of the ways Mr. Hart improves student learning is by tackling issues of national and historical importance. Students must work together on research projects and give presentations to their classmates. One of the most recent projects was by two students who focused on race in the United States and how it was manifested on the baseball field. Mr. Hart believes that by empowering children, they become better learners and have the confidence to tackle topics and develop skills well-beyond their grade level. 
   Superintendent Roger Lenhert describes Mr. Hart as the model of an ideal teacher. His energy in the classroom motivates his students to not only to advance in their studies, but to also pursue goals and interests outside of the classroom. Mr. Hart also encourages his students to act responsibly and to treat others with respect. 
   Mr. Hart's students succeed in academic competitions, both under his tutelage and after, and he continue to guide his students well after they left the elementary school. I am told by Dr. Berres that it is not uncommon to see Mr. Hart's old students coming by his classroom to visit him and to update him on their current achievements. It is clear by the visits of his former students and praising words of the superintendent and principal that Mr. Hart makes an enormous impact on his students. 
   Educators like Greg Hart clearly demonstrate that it is the people that know our children's names--their parents, their teachers, their administrators, and their school board members--who will make the best decisions about their education. I applaud Mr. Hart's hard work and dedication to his students and I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing his outstanding contribution to education.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, good health is one of life's greatest blessings. Over the last 25 years, there has been a tremendous change for the better in the delivery of health care. New drugs help to prevent heart disease and provide better treatments for cancer, allergies, depression, and many other debilitating conditions. In short, prescription drugs can help people live longer, lead healthier, happier, more productive lives--and can help lower the overall cost of health care. We all applaud. 
   The United States leads the world in the development of new drugs. Almost half of the new drugs developed in the last 25 years were created in the USA. 
   But new drugs are expensive to develop. Only one of every five candidate medicines will turn out to be effective, be approved by the FDA and make it to  drug store shelves. Last year, the drug industry spent $24 billion on research and development. U.S. taxpayers also invest $18 billion every year in the National Institutes of Health, which provides grants for basic health research. Drug companies that are willing to take on the risk of developing new treatments receive tax credits for their research and development costs. 
   Yet when American consumers pick up their prescription at the drugstore they pay again for research and development in the form of higher prices. Why? Every other developed country imposes some form of price control. Those countries pay for the cost of manufacturing the drug, which is normal, and maybe some profit; but they don't even come close to paying a fair share of the research and development costs of new drugs developed in the United States. 
   So when some Americans get sick, they can't afford the medicine they need to stay healthy. Instead they go without or they ration medicine. If they are able to travel, Americans cross the borders to Canada or Mexico to buy for much less, the prescriptions they need to stay healthy. 
   I was curious to know just how much my constituents were savings by traveling to Canada. My office recently conducted an informal study comparing the prices of the top ten most commonly prescribed prescription drugs in several Washington state retail drug stores to the price paid in a typical Canadian pharmacy. I was astounded by the results: on average prices are 64% lower in Canada. 
   Here are a few examples: The average cost of 30 pills of Zocor, which used to treat high cholesterol, is $76 in our state, in Canada it costs $38; Premerin, an estrogen replacement therapy used by many women, is $26 in our state and $10.50 just across the border; and a popular new allergy treatment, Claritin, is just $34 in Canada but almost $80 in Washington State. 
   During last week's break, I spent time talking with seniors, doctors, hospital administrators, and others about the cost of prescription drugs. All expressed their concern about the growing amount spent on medicine and the ability of people to continue to have access to the medication that keeps them healthy. 
   While this debate has properly focused a lot of attention on uninsured seniors and their daily struggle to pay for needed medications, the costs of prescription drugs affect every American--even those with health insurance coverage. Drug spending is a growing part of our overall health care costs. The rising cost of prescription drugs is one of the biggest problems facing health plans, hospitals and others in the health care field. 
   Obviously, American drug companies have to pay for this huge amount of research and development and the years that it takes to get these drugs licensed. But, what I am outraged about is a set of foreign policies that means that Americans who by drugs that were developed in America pay substantially more for those drugs than the same manufacturers sell--them for in Canada or Mexico. I think that is unconscionable. Those countries are riding on our research and development. 
   The cost issue is one important part of the debate as we talk about modernizing the Medicare program to include a prescription drug benefit. I do think that Medicare should be updated and that prescription drugs should be covered under the program. Expanding this benefit, however, must be done responsibly--it must not jeopardize the solvency of the current program and that benefits now available to seniors. It is also fairly contentious. Most agree that we should add a drug benefit to Medicare, however, good people have honest disagreements about the best way to do it. Addressing cost is something we can do now. 
   It is no fair to the American consumer to let other countries get away with policies that make drug companies sell their products cheaper in their country because they don't want to pay for any of the development costs. It's not right, and I will work actively to see that Americans are not overcharged. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with some hesitancy I will vote in favor of the flag protection constitutional amendment. My hesitancy stems not from any doubt that our Nation should provide specially protected status to our flag--I firmly believe the flag should be protected from desecration. I am hesitant because we are voting to amend our Nation's Constitution and every Senator should exercise extreme caution when considering such changes. 
   I have given careful consideration on the important amendment currently before the Senate. A decade ago, when the Supreme Court issued its 5-to-4 decision invalidating flag desecration statutes, I read each of the three opinions filed by Justices of the Court. I was convinced then, and remain convinced now, that the Court erred in its decision and that such statutes, if properly written, are constitutional. For this reason, I shall vote in favor of both the constitutional amendment to protect our flag and the proposed amendment to substitute a flag protection statute for the constitutional amendment.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my number one priority as I represent the people of Washington state in the U.S. Senate is protecting the Northwest way of life. An intricate part of that Washington way of life is preserving our healthy and productive forests and streams. With that goal in mind, I am delighted to recognize the Centennial Anniversary of the Weyerhaeuser Company--an organization whose dedication to sustainable forestry has enriched Washington state with both a vibrant timber industry and a tradition of preservation to keep our forests healthy for generations to come. 
   In 1900, Frederick Weyerhaeuser and fifteen partners began the company that would revolutionize the timber industry. They purchased 900,000 acres of Washington forest land from the Northern Pacific Railway and began the Weyerhaeuser Company. It quickly grew to become one of the most vibrant and remarkable companies, not only in Washington state, but around the world. 
   The Weyerhaeuser Company had a vision for sustainable and environmentally responsible forest management before ``green'' became fashionable. In 1904, General Manager George Long sponsored a study to look at the impacts of growing timber as a crop--replenishing the resource with every harvest. Under Long's leadership, Weyerhaeuser pioneered many of the conservation, fire protection and reforestation techniques used in forest management today. 
   I am proud of and thankful for the great legacy that Weyerhaeuser has given to Washington--the Evergreen State. I hope that with balanced policies and responsible stewardship, Weyerhaeuser will continue to prosper in the next century.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to recognize the contributions of two remarkable residents of my state, Dr. Michael and Shainie Schuffler, who have dedicated their lives to strengthening their community, fostering leadership qualities in our young people and working tirelessly to improve the health of countless people. 
   Michael and Shainie met during their college years in Chicago where they both shared a keen interest in medicine. In 1970, the couple moved to Seattle and have since continued to make the Seattle area a better place. After their move to Seattle, Shainie became actively involved in the Hadassah Hospital. Hadassah is a volunteer women's organization that works to strengthen a partnership with Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, and realize their potential as a dynamic force in American society. In Seattle and around the United States, Hadassah enhances the quality of American and Jewish life through its education and Zionist youth programs, promotes health awareness, and provides personal enrichment and growth for its members. 
   After joining Hadassah, Shainie found herself inspired by its founder, Henrietta Szold, and has worked tirelessly for the past fifteen years on specific projects at both the chapter and regional levels including the Women's Symposium and last year's Bigger Gifts dinner and has served as the President of Hadassah's Seattle Chapter. 
   Shainie's dedication to the Seattle community is also evident in her many other involvements such as the Council of Women's Presidents for the Jewish Federation, Jewish Family Service, and the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. 
   I believe that one of the most important aspects of Shainie's work is her dedication to today's youth. Under her leadership as the Seattle area's Director of Admissions for the Alexander Muss High School in Israel, hundreds of local students have been given the opportunity to attend the Alexander Muss High School in Israel and has become one of the most successful youth programs in Seattle. I applaud her tireless efforts and believe that her work has directly impacted the lives of thousands of people throughout our state. 
   Michael has been equally dedicated to both his career as a leading doctor of Gastroenterology and as a volunteer in his community. Michael is a world authority on the pathology and clinical manifestations of neurological disorders of the intestinal tract and has been recognized by his colleagues for his many accomplishments. 
   Michael's work does not end, however, when he leaves the hospital. Like his wife, he has dedicated countless hours to Hadassah by serving as a visiting professor of Gastroenterology and as an Hadassah associate. He has also worked to encourage leadership qualities in our children through the Jewish Federation's Young Leadership Program, serving as its co-chair for three years. 
   One of his greatest loves in life is pro-Israel activism and has dedicated his time to furthering this cause through American Israel Public Affairs Committee otherwise known as AIPAC. He served as the Chairman of AIPAC from 1986 to 1994, strengthening the support of AIPAC across Washington state and furthering its reputation as the leading organization on United States-Israel relations. 
   Throughout their different commitments Michael and Shainie have always supported one another and recognized the importance of each other's work. Theirs is a true partnership and one that has positively impacted the people of our state. I ask my colleagues to join me as I applaud the outstanding and inspiring work of Dr. Michael and Shainie Schuffler.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I join Senator MURRAY from Washington State in introducing legislation that will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to develop a water reuse project with Lakehaven Utility District in Federal Way, WA. 
   The Lakehaven Utility District is one of Washington State's largest water and sewer utilities, providing 10.5 million gallons of water a day to over 100,000 residents in South King County. The utility depends on a groundwater supply system that is replenished by local precipitation. As development in this Seattle suburb has increased, aquifer recharge has diminished. The utility district recognizes it must protect its precious resources and has undertaken several projects to ensure it will have an adequate water supply for future generations. 
   One of these projects involves extensive treatment of the utilities effluent for reuse. Some of the treated water will be used to irrigate golf courses and other facilities, while the rest of the water will be returned to the aquifer through injection wells. The techniques for water reuse are innovative, yet proven, and have been implemented throughout Nevada and California. Currently, the Lakehaven Utility District discharges 6 million gallons of treated water into Puget Sound every day. This new program will allow the district to reuse these crucial resources while replenishing its precious groundwater supply. 
   This legislation amends title XVI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide the Lakehaven Utility District the technical and financial assistance necessary to implement its reuse project. 
   I am pleased to support this project, which I believe is crucial to maintaining wetlands and rivers in Washington State. The Northwest is faced with a salmon crisis that demands every available drop of water remain in our streams and riparian areas. The Lakehaven Utility District water reclamation project will ensure that the South King County community continues to rely on groundwater resources rather than turning to other sources that must be preserved for fish recovery.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, Members of this body, in speaking against a similar, though not identical, attempt to amend the Constitution of the United States 2 or 3 years ago, I spoke of amending the first amendment. 
   As I read this short and very simple proposal from the Senators from South Carolina and Arizona with respect to political speech, it does not amend the first amendment. It repeals it. It states that the Congress of the United States has the power reasonably to limit contributions or expenditures with respect to elections for Federal and State offices. That is exactly the power the Congress of the United States would have were there no first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Our actions in that respect would have to meet some test of reasonableness under the 14th amendment in that field as they do in every other. But for all practical purposes, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, ratified by the States 209 years ago, would be repealed with respect to political speech. 
   Now, it is not deemed that obscenity is a significant enough threat to the people of the United States to repeal or even to amend the first amendment in that respect. It is not considered important enough to change the first  amendment with respect to tobacco or alcohol advertising. But it is considered that free and open political speech, through anything other than an individual's voice, is now such a great threat to the free institutions of the United States that Congress--that is to say, incumbent officeholders--ought to be able to limit it in any way they deem reasonable. This is clearly, as was its predecessor in 1997, the most profound threat to first amendment rights, literally, since that Constitution was adopted. 
   The Alien and Sedition Acts in the last decade of the 18th century were, after all, only statutes that were subject to challenge under the Constitution. They also had an automatic termination date to them. They are nonetheless constant examples of how a Congress can misuse its powers to limit speech and are considered such in almost any thorough history of the Constitution and of the United States itself. 
   Now, what is it that leads us to this moment? Clearly, it is the feeling, the opinion, that too much money is spent on politics, that there is too much political speech, and that it is clearly too free. The distinguished colleague who sits in front of me and was recently a candidate for President was, I think, rightly critical of two Texas millionaires who advertised in a way he considered misleading and false. This proposal would say that they could be completely muzzled, that they could be denied the right to speak at all, if it was deemed unreasonable. And certainly the candidate who was the victim of such speech deems it to be unreasonable, as would many incumbents in many Congresses in the United States. 
   We are here dealing with this proposition: Too much money is being spent on politics. Not that too much money is being spent on regulating the activities of the people of the United States, not that too much money is being spent on social or political programs of the United States, but that too much money is spent in responding to those programs and to that regulation and that somehow or another the power of the Federal Government to regulate economic, environmental, and social activities is so benign that we can muzzle the criticisms of those who are adversely affected by that regulation. At least we can muzzle those expressions which are directed at changing the people who write the very laws that impose those regulations. 
   We can at the very least ascribe consistency and thoughtfulness to the promoters of this constitutional amendment who are also eloquent spokespersons for the original McCain-Feingold legislation, legislation that limits, that comes close to eliminating the right of an outside person so much as to mention the name of a candidate 6 weeks before an election. 
   Yes, if you want to say that anyone--including a newspaper editorialist but even more significantly, someone who does not own a newspaper--who wants to criticize a candidate for office in the 6 weeks before an election, if you want to eliminate that right, if you think it is desirable to limit or to eliminate that right, you do, in fact, need this constitutional amendment. 
   McCain-Feingold, as it came before this body, in that respect at least is clearly and blatantly and openly in violation of a constitutional provision, the first amendment, that says: ``Congress shall make no law respecting freedom of speech or of the press.'' That may be the single most quoted line in the entire Constitution of the United States. But the proponents of this amendment here today propose effectively to strike it from the Constitution as it relates to election campaigns for Federal or State or local office. 
   The statement of the case should assure its defeat. The statement of the case that somehow or another we are too political, that campaigns for office are too robust as they deal with this massive engine of the Federal Government, and that we should repeal one of the founding theories of this Government, the right of completely untrammeled and totally free political speech, to state that proposition is to defeat. 
   We should not repeal the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States with respect to free political speech. We should not modify the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States with respect to free political speech. We should, though we may lack the imaginations of James Madison and his colleagues in the first Congress, at least have the wisdom and the humility not to destroy what they wrought at the very founding of this constitutional Republic.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, throughout Washington state there are thousands of people who volunteer their free time to tutor, mentor, support our teachers and make a difference in their communities and in lives of our children. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an outstanding volunteer, Captain Jerry Burke of the Everett Police Department who has passed his love of the theater onto a group of elementary students at Madison Elementary in Everett. For his efforts, I am proud to award him with my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards. 
   Captain Burke participates in a program in which members of the Police Command Staff adopt an elementary school in the Everett School District. While it is no surprise to see a police officer donating his or her time to a local school, Captain Burke is teaching something a little out of the ordinary for a cop who used to go undercover to bust drug dealers--he teaches a drama class. 
   When Captain Burke first approached principal Joyce Stewart, she was intrigued by his Fine Arts Degree in Designing for the Theater and his experience teaching theater arts prior to entering law enforcement. Furthermore, she was already interested in creating a drama program to expose interested students to the fine arts. Though he had no prior experience in creating such a program, or in teaching drama to elementary school students, Captain Burke agreed to take on the challenge. 
   This program has been a tremendous success. Captain Burke and the school created a drama club open to fourth and fifth graders that meets after school one day a week. The program continues to grow and approximately 35 students are now participating. The program combines lectures with creative drama games that emphasize communication, visualization, creativity, and improvisation. More importantly, the students enjoy the club and Captain Burke. Fourth grader Shawn Cook said, ``Police officers are always supposed to be tough. Mr. Burke is funny and tough.'' 
   This spring's club is limited to 10 weeks since Captain Burke is attending the FBI academy in April, but he and Ms. Stewart are already considering options for spring of 2001 that would create a second creative drama class of third and fourth graders. The more experienced fifth grade students from this year's club are planning to put on the school's first ever dramatic production. Clearly, Captain Burke has made a significant contribution to the lives of these students and given them an interest that will last throughout their life. 
   One remarkable aspect of this program is that it demonstrates the importance of community involvement in our local schools. From this program, students will not only have an appreciation for the fine arts, but the will also have an appreciation for police officers and have a greater sense of community. I applaud the work of Captain Burke and wish his students the best of luck in producing their first play. Thank you to Captain Burke, and to all the members of the Everett Police Command staff for your contributions to local elementary schools.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I travel across Washington state, one of the first topics I hear about from local businesses and high-tech companies is their need for people with high-tech skills. A Poulsbo company, Paladin Data, has taken their efforts to find skilled employees to a new level by donating its time and resources to train teachers in some of Washington state's public schools. For its commitment to working with teachers, improving student learning and expanding their skills, I am pleased to present Paladin Data with one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards. 
   Several years ago, seven school districts in Kitsap, Mason, and Pierce Counties developed the West Sound School-to-Career Consortium which provides approximately 14,000 students with high-tech classes. This year Paladin Data will begin its first year of a three-year project that provides high-tech training to teachers involved with the West Sound School-to-Career program. Paladin Data is also contributing $50,000 in matching funds to a state grant of $100,000 to provide needed curriculum materials and onsite  teacher training in either a Paladin facility in Poulsbo or at a designated school district site. Moreover, each school district will determine what training their teachers will received based on the needs of their district and their students. 
   Paladin is giving our teachers more information and skills that they can take back to their classrooms and shows teachers what skills employers are looking for in perspective employees, giving their students a leg up on the competition. Paladin's involvement is not only improving the education of our students, but also giving them an accurate picture of what skills they need well-before they enter the job market. 
   The Washington Software Alliance reports that over 64,000 computer-related jobs are currently unfilled in the State of Washington--all for lack of properly trained workers. I find it encouraging to see companies like Paladin Data, that are contributing to our booming economy, are taking an active role in ensuring the quality education of our children. I am proud to acknowledge Paladin Data Systems Corporation's commitment to education and I look forward to hearing about more companies making a contribution to our children's future.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a number of my Republican colleagues have spoken on the floor about the absence of an energy policy on the part of the Clinton-Gore administration. I believe that description is only half right. It is true the Clinton-Gore administration has no express energy policy that would lead or even contribute to U.S. energy independence. But the Clinton-Gore administration, on the other hand, does have a very significant implicit energy policy. Under that policy, it discourages or prohibits exploration for either oil or natural gas over extensive and increasingly large areas of our country. 
   Under that implicit energy policy, it proposes to reduce the amount of hydroelectric power we have and, in fact, to treat hydroelectric power as though it were not renewable. 
   Under that implicit energy policy, it has given us an increasing dependence each year on foreign sources for petroleum products, now at 55 or 56 percent, and inevitably directed at 65 percent or two-thirds of that oil. Implicitly, it has given us an energy policy that resulted last month in the largest single trade deficit in the history of the United States, due, in major part, to imports of petroleum products and a trade deficit that will inevitably continue to increase. 
   So suddenly we do have a short-term explicit energy policy. It is to send the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America, hat in hand, to countries in Latin America, in Southwest Asia, and now most recently into Nigeria, to plead with these countries to lower the cost of the oil they send to us. This is a total abdication of the appropriate policy of an administration interested in the trade balance of the United States and in energy independence for the United States. 
   Mr. President, what is the answer to this question? Obviously, in the short term our hands are relatively tied. We do, however, have one option in front of us which we can engage immediately that will provide at least modest relief to the American people during the course of this energy crisis, and that is the elimination--whether permanent or temporary--of the 4.3-cent motor vehicle fuel tax that was imposed by the President and the Congress in 1993. 
   I am convinced we should follow that course of action. It is urgent for everyone. It is overwhelmingly urgent for the airlines of the United States that operate in a highly competitive atmosphere. They are being brutally punished, along with their passengers, with the increased airfare caused by that tax. 
   This is an option the Congress could and should take up and pass with extreme promptness. However, in the long run, the more important solution is a longer-term solution. That solution lies on two sides: the supply of energy for the people of the United States to use and the way in which we use that energy with appropriate conservation measures. 
   From the point of view of supply, when we deal with petroleum alone, we should change policies which have discouraged production in the United States--policies of regulation and taxation and hostility that have closed down existing sources of supply in various parts of the United States. 
   We should very seriously consider and move toward the creation of new sources of supply rather than cutting them off and prohibiting them, whether they are in the North Slope of Alaska or in various parts of the lower 48 States of the United States. We need to do this in order to have any leverage with the rest of the world with respect to the prices it charges us for petroleum supplies. This policy should apply not only to petroleum but to natural gas as well. 
   Second, I am convinced we should continue to encourage and should encourage even more the production of at least supplements to our petroleum supply that are totally within the control of the United States and that are renewable in nature. Ethanol perhaps ranks as No. 1 on this particular list. It can be produced by American grain. It adds to our supply, and it is, of course, completely within our own control, and it enriches the people who provide these agricultural commodities. 
   Next, from the point of view of conservation, I point out the utter and insane folly of proposing to remove dams from the Snake River that produce renewable and environmentally benign electric power. If those dams are removed, as many in the administration wish to do, we will end up putting 700,000 trucks on the roads of the northwestern part of the United States each and every year more than are on those roads at the present time--major trucks that carry grain and other products for export. The idea that we should be using all of that additional amount of diesel and gasoline fuel is simply, in my view, beyond reasonable consideration. 
   Finally, I believe we have to aim at the way in which we as Americans use power, and particularly motor vehicle fuels. Last July, for the first time in several years, this body was asked once again by me and by other Senators to go back to the successes of the 1970s and to reestablish a Government program to improve the energy efficiency of our automobiles and small trucks, the so-called CAFE standards. In the 1970s, this was one of the most successful programs--the single most successful governmental program--in history. We came close to doubling the average mileage of our passenger automobiles during that period of time. This crisis would not be a crisis; it would be an unmitigated disaster had those who perceived it not established and implemented those policies of the 1970s. But in the early 1980s, we abandoned that policy, and we have abandoned it ever since. 
   We have even gone so far in this body and in the other body to prohibit any study of increasing CAFE standards, as far as small trucks are concerned, and even automobiles at any time in the immediate future. When we voted on that proposition last July, 40 Members of this body--not a majority but a very substantial minority--voted in favor of it before there was a crisis. Now the  crisis is upon us. Now we have people wondering why it is our small trucks and SUVs are so energy inefficient. People are being punished by the lack of foresight of this administration and having the cost of operating those vehicles increase exponentially, and it is often not affordable. 
   I am convinced that in addition to providing a greater degree of supply from sources within the United States we must, once again, focus on making our use of that energy and particularly making petroleum energy more efficient. The best way we can do that is by going back to the CAFE standard regime we had a generation ago in the United States and doing what is technologically quite feasible to do by increasing anywhere from 20 to 50 percent the efficiency of the engines that use petroleum products. That would be a true energy policy--an energy policy both for the short term and the long term, a policy which is totally and completely lacking in the Clinton-Gore administration at the present time. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week the city of Bellingham was the site of a Senate field hearing on pipeline safety. This hearing comes after the unspeakable tragedy that took place when three young boys were killed after a gasoline pipeline exploded in Bellingham on June 10. 
   I want to share with you my thoughts from the hearing and outline future congressional action as the Senate Commerce Committee prepares to reauthorize the Office of Pipeline Safety this year. 
   Unfortunately, my Senate Commerce Committee colleagues were unable to attend last Monday's hearing in Bellingham, but I believe the committee has no greater priority than to making sure the pipelines running underneath our schools, neighborhoods, churches, and senior centers are safe. 
   Pipeline safety concerns aren't unique to Washington. We're seeing States such as Texas, Wisconsin, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania respond to various local pipeline issues from oil spills and leaks to siting battles. In the last decade, there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks, averaging roughly one per day. These accidents resulted in 201 deaths, close to 3,000 injuries and $778 million in property damage. And for the first time, a National Pipeline Safety Conference will be held in Washington, D.C. next month. 
   Though the sacrifice is one that no family and no community should have to make, the tragedy in Bellingham would be even worse if we did not learn from it and apply those lessons to try to prevent other accidents. To this end, last week's hearing was invaluable. 
   While the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, here's what we do know: 
   We know that many people in Bellingham were unaware that a pipeline was even running through their neighborhood. 
   We know that the Office of Pipeline Safety ignored enhanced safety requirements, including increased inspections inside pipes, in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in 1992 and 1996. 
   We learned that cities through which the Olympic Pipelines Company line runs have tremendous concerns with the integrity of the pipelines, and have had problems getting information and cooperation from the company. 
   We know that the National Transportation Safety Board has criticized OPS for its poor record of responding to NTSB recommendations. NTSB Chairman Jim Hall has even said, ``There's no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety is in charge or that its regulations, its inspections, its assets, its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task.'' 
   We know that right now, the power to oversee and regulate the safety of the millions of miles of pipelines running underneath our communities rests with the federal Office of Pipeline Safety under the supervision of the Department of Transportation. And in the case of implementing pipeline safety standards in Washington State they have failed miserably. 
   We learned that only a handful of States have the power to implement tougher safety standards, and when States are given this authority, their safety record is equal if not greater to that of OPS. 
   So, where does this leave us? 
   State government, local government, and citizen groups in Washington State were quick to answer the wake-up call from Bellingham and examine what they could do to improve pipeline safety. What they found was that while there are significant actions Washington can take to prevent and respond to accidents, such as improving the State's call-before-you-dig requirements, increasing public awareness, and training emergency response personnel, there is a lot the state cannot do with respect to prescribing safety standards because Federal law preempts state regulations. 
   Today is already March 23. We know this is going to be a short legislative year. Many will say we won't have the time to address this issue this year. I disagree. Congress is due to reauthorize the Office of Pipelines Safety and we've been told the administration will submit its proposal to Congress any day now. 
   Senator MURRAY and I are supporting legislation to give states greater authority in adopting tougher pipeline safety standards. Given the Office of Pipelines Safety's failure to make pipeline safety a priority, its reluctance to cede any authority to states, I feel we must move forward. 
   When I asked both the Office of Pipeline Safety and the NTSB last week to take a position on our pipeline legislation, the answer was less than clear. After listening to the painful and damaging testimony that scourged OPS's safety record and failure to comply with 
   congressionally-mandated safety requirements, I was speechless at their unwillingness to relinquish oversight authority to the states. The State of Washington, the people of Bellingham and communities along the pipeline route are ready and capable of implementing tougher safety standards. I demand OPS to take a firm position on this pipeline legislation. 
   I also request that my good friend and colleague, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, schedule a vote on the various pipeline safety proposals. 
   As I have said before, this pipeline legislation may not be perfect, and I believe we need to do some more listening before we arrive at the final pipeline safety proposal. NTSB officials highlighted the complexities of regulating pipelines that pass through a  number of States. They made their case as to why they should retain sole authority to regulate interstate pipelines. But it was an unpersuasive case. I encourage the Office of Pipeline Safety to consider my proposal to allow States which have at least 90 percent of a pipeline passing through their borders, to have greater authority in setting and implementing its own safety and inspection standards. 
   As Senator MURRAY and I await the administration's proposal, we agree that the following proposals must be included in the final legislation: 
   Allow States greater authority to adopt and enforce safety standards for interstate pipelines, particularly in light of the absence of meaningful federal standards. 
   This increase in authority should be accompanied by an increase in grants to States to carry out pipeline safety activities. 
   Improve the collection and dissemination of information about pipelines to the public and to local and State officials responsible for preventing and responding to pipeline accidents. This includes ensuring that operators are collecting the information necessary to accurately assess and respond to risks. The public should be informed about where pipelines are, what condition they are in, when they fail and why they fail. 
   Adopt more stringent national standards for pipeline testing, monitoring, and operation. 
   Ensure congressional mandates are followed, and make sure there are sufficient resources to enforce regulations. 
   Invest more in research and development to improve pipeline inspections. 
   Create a model oversight oil spill advisory panel in Washington State. This body would have the authority to not only respond, but to initiate the development of pipeline safety measures. 
   I have long believed that those closest to the problem are in a better position to help develop the solution. Families in Washington state, and across the country, have already paid to high a price for us to miss this opportunity to put higher federal safety standards into law.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for too many years I have worked in support of repealing the unfair Annual Earnings Test on Social Security. Incredibly, working seniors currently forfeit one dollar of Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn over the earnings limit of $17,000. 
   If an American spends a lifetime paying into the Social Security system with the guarantee that he or she will get their money when he or she turns 62 or 65 years old, no one should be able to take those benefits away simply because the beneficiary wants to keep working. Why should the federal government be discouraging those seniors who want to keep on working from doing so? As our country faces increasing demands for labor, we can ill afford to deprive ourselves of the skills and experience America's seniors have to offer. The federal government shouldn't be in the position of discouraging anyone from working: seniors should be allowed to make their own decisions. 
   Over the past few weeks, I have listened to and read the comments of numerous Washington state seniors who lose a portion of their hard-earned Social Security benefits simply because they do not wish to retire or stop working. I have been listening to these same comments for many years, and I can honestly say that today it looks as if common sense will finally prevail and a solution will pass the House and the Senate. Importantly, President Clinton recently changed his position on this issue and now says he will sign this legislation to abolish the Earnings Test. 
   I will cast my vote for abolishing this unfair tax. Repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test is a victory for seniors and every generation of Americans.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I had hoped to come to the floor today in support of the long-awaited, long-anticipated crop insurance reform bill. My colleagues, Senators ROBERTS and KERREY, have toiled over this legislation, laboring to ensure that the risk management activities America's farmers will undertake are fair, affordable, and comprehensive. 
   Instead, I understand that a few of our Democratic colleagues have placed a hold on the bill, while ironically, an editorial in the Washington Post this morning decries the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act and the very legislation I had hoped would pass today. 
   Mr. President, nearly every major commodity group in the nation supports the Roberts/Kerrey bill and have, through the voices of their membership, called upon us to act. Instead of working to pass crop insurance legislation growers from across the country have been anxiously awaiting, we instead find ourselves once again defending the principles of freedom to farm. 
   To use America's farmers as a pawn in an election year political game, at a time when the agriculture economy is in a serious state of flux, in my opinion invalidates their plight. When we should be passing comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that enhances the  safety net for American farmers, we instead find ourselves fighting to address a bill the farming community nearly overwhelmingly desires. 
   As of late, farmers in the Pacific Northwest have found themselves in this same game far too often. At the same time the Administration sends officials out to Washington state claiming to provide solutions to these serious issues, regulators under the Clinton-Gore watch are working to eliminate the water, transportation infrastructure, chemicals, and in general the tools necessary for farmers to continue their livelihood. 
   Last week, the Washington Association of Wheat Growers made the 3,000 mile trip to Washington, DC to encourage me to support the crop insurance reform we were supposed to address today. At a time when check books barely balance, fuel prices are outrageously high, while commodity prices are low, these folks asked for our help. Unfortunately today, these proud and previously profitable growers must wait. They must wait for several folks on the other side of the aisle to make a political monster of crop insurance before they can receive this desired reform. 
   Mr. President, when the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act finally comes before us here in the Senate, I will support the efforts of Senators ROBERTS and KERREY, of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and of those voices in rural America who demand crop insurance reform.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I travel across Washington state, one of the first topics I hear about from local businesses and high-tech companies is their need for people with high-tech skills. A Poulsbo company, Paladin Data, has taken their efforts to find skilled employees to a new level by donating is time and resources to train teachers in some of Washington state's public schools. For its commitment to working with teachers, improving student learning and expanding their skills, I am pleased to present Paladin Data with one of my `Innovation in Education' Awards. 
   Several years ago, seven school districts in Kitsap, Mason, and Pierce Counties developed the West Sound School-to-Career Consortium which provides approximately 14,000 students with high-tech classes. This year Paladin Data will begin its first year of a three-year project that provides high-tech training to teachers involved with the West Sound School-to-Career program. Paladin data is also contributing $50,000 in matching funds to a state grant of $100,000 to provide needed curriculum materials and onsite teacher training in either a Paladin facility in Poulsbo or at a designated school district site. Moreover, each school district will determine what training their teachers will receive based on the needs of their district and their students. 
   Paladin is giving our teachers more information and skills that they can take back to their classrooms and shows teachers what skills employers are looking for in perspective employees, giving their students a leg up on the competition. Paladin's involvement is not only improving the education of our students, but also giving them an accurate picture of what skills they need well-before they enter the job market. 
   The Washington Software Alliance reports that over 64,000 computer-related jobs are currently unfilled in the State of Washington--all for lack of properly trained workers. I find it encouraging to see companies like Paladin Data, that are contributing to our booming economy, are taking an active role in ensuring the quality education of our children. I am proud to acknowledge Paladin Data System Systems Corporation's commitment to education and I look forward to hearing about more companies making a contribution to our children's future.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two weekends ago I had the pleasure of joining a unique group of volunteers and high school students in Enumclaw, WA, in the first steps toward restoring a forested wetland on Newaukum Creek. 
   This project is sponsored by the city of Enumclaw and the Mid-Puget Sound Fisheries Enhancement Group (MPSFEG). MPSFEG and the city of Enumclaw have entered into an agreement for the group to remove nonnative vegetation and plan various native wetland species. The group will monitor the project for 3 years to ensure success of the project. 
   MPSFEG's Troy Fields and Fiona McNair were kind enough to explain the challenges facing Newaukum creek salmon, and how restoring such wetlands will increase water quality and habitat, and therefore increase the chances of young fish surviving. 
   MPSFEG is joined in this effort by a group of enterprising students from Enumclaw High school, led by their teacher Mike Buck. Mr. Buck has used many different sites in the watershed including this one as an outdoor laboratory for his science classes. Projects have included water quality and stream insect monitoring and restoration. 
   Mike's approach to teaching is unique, and one that I am wholly impressed with. He has taken it upon himself to involve these young people in science-based restoration projects where they can best witness the results of their efforts--in their own backyard. 
   It is for this reason that I was proud to award Mike Buck with an Innovation in Education award for excellence and creativity in hands-on science learning. This project is yet another example of why decisions affecting our children's education should be made locally, not in Washington DC. No federal bureaucrat could understand the  difficult prospects Newaukum Creek salmon face in their return home to spawn. And no federal bureaucrat could successfully turn that challenge into an educational opportunity that also works for returning salmon as Mike Buck has. 
   Therefore, I propose to my colleagues here in the Senate that this successful venture is further proof that local educators will be able to make the best decisions about the unique needs of their students.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the nomination of U.S. District Court Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court is, to put it mildly, controversial. His nomination has now been before the Senate for almost 4 years, a period of time close to a dubious record. He deserves a vote, and at least serious consideration of an affirmative vote, for that reason alone.  
   The President nominates, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints judges to the Federal courts. That constitutional system allows Senators as much latitude to approve or disapprove judicial nominations on the basis of the nominee's judicial and political philosophies as it does to the President in making those nominations. In my view, however, that senatorial prerogative does not extend to rejecting Presidential nominees solely on the ground that a Senator would have chosen someone else. If a nominee clearly falls within a fairly broad philosophical mainstream and is otherwise competent, he or she should probably be confirmed. 
   In my view, Judge Paez falls within that broad mainstream. I have considered carefully the objections of colleagues whose views I greatly respect. But I have also considered the views of Republicans and conservatives from California and who know Judge Paez best--including Congressman ROGAN. Their views persuade me to vote to confirm Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit. 
   The nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit, however, seems to me to create too great a risk that we are confirming someone for a lifetime appointment to the most influential circuit court in the country, who falls on the far side of the philosophical divide I described in my remarks on Judge Paez. Ms. Berzon has a relatively narrow scope of private practice in a highly ideological field, and has been active and ideological in the expression of her political views. Ms. Berzon also has no judicial experience, and so has no record by which to determine whether her ideological activism will be curtailed once she is on the bench. It certainly is possible that it would be. It is also possible that it will not. Given the concerns of many, including my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who voted against her confirmation, that the Ninth Circuit already is ideologically unbalanced, I simply am not willing to take this risk. I see no clear reason to consent, in constitutional terms, to her nomination.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during the course of the last 2 weeks, the health committee has been dealing with the vitally important subject of education and has been engaged over a period of many hours in the writing of a bill extending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of the United States. That writing process, in my view, has been highly constructive. It has also been ignored by the press of the United States and, therefore, by most of the people of the United States. It does not deserve that fate. 
   Education is a vitally important subject, and the Federal role in education, a role that has increased markedly over the course of the last several decades, is at a crossroads in the course of that debate--a debate which I hope next month will proceed to the floor of the Senate. 
   This is truly a defining moment in our history in Congress. We have an opportunity to greatly improve and change the direction of Federal Government funding for schools all across the United States of America. We get this opportunity only once every 4 to 6 years, when the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes before us. 
   I am convinced we will do that job best by listening to our constituents who have an immediate concern with education--an immediate concern because they are the parents of our public school students, an immediate concern because they are teachers in our schools, and an immediate concern because they are principals or elected school board members in those schools; in other words, people whose lives revolve around the education of the next generation of American young people. 
   I am going to try to do my part during the course of the recess over the next 10 days by once again spending a considerable amount of my time visiting schools in the State of Washington in Bellingham, Mount Vernon, Spokane, and Colfax, carrying on a tradition I have used increasingly over the course of the last 3 or 4 or 5 years. 
   What I found during those visits is that each school is different from every other school. They are united only in the concern of the people who work in those schools for the future of our children. Some of those schools need more teachers. Some need teachers who are better paid to compete with outside opportunities. Some need more classroom space. Some need better teaching for the teachers. Others need more computers. But different as those needs are, present Federal policy says here is what you must do with the money we provide you in literally dozens and perhaps hundreds of different narrow categorical functions, each of which requires a bureaucracy in Washington,  DC, to look over applications and to run audits, and each of which requires a corresponding bureaucracy in our States and in our local school districts to ask for the money and to account for how it is spent. 
   I have proposed, and a majority of the members of the health committee are now proposing, to add to this Federal formula a bill that I call Straight A's to inject what I consider to be some common sense in the way in which we help our schools in Washington, DC. 
   Straight A's will give to States all across the United States an opportunity to change from a process of accountability to a performance accountability. Instead of spending their time filling out forms to show that they have spent their money exactly as Congress has dictated, a State which elects to come under Straight A's will be able to take one to two dozen of these narrow categorical aid programs, combine them into one, and get rid of all the forms and most of this process accountability on the basis of one's promise. That promise is: Let us do what we think best for our kids, and we will do a better job. Our kids will do better. We will have standardized tests in our States and we will prove they are doing better, because we are allowed to make more of our own decisions or you can cancel the whole thing and take it back. 
   It is as simple as that. 
   It is the provision of trust in people who are putting their lives and their years into the education of our kids, the people who know our kids' names, rather than a group in the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or in this body which so often seems to feel it can and should act as one nationwide school board. 
   I have heard a lot from the defenders of the status quo over the course of the last 3 years. One of the first who criticized my earlier proposal said: My gosh, if we let them do that, they will spend all the money on swimming pools. Another said it might be football helmets. 
   All of them had one common thought: We don't dare let our educators and our school board members make up their minds; They would make mistakes; We know more than they do; We know more than the people in your hometown, Mr. President, in Kansas, or my people in the State of Washington, or the constituents of the Senator from the State of Virginia. Somehow we know the cure for 17,000 school districts across the United States. 
   The biggest of the present Federal programs is title I, originally passed 35 years ago to narrow the gap between underprivileged children and privileged children. The gap has not narrowed in that 35 years. Is it not time we give some of our States and some of our school districts the opportunity to say they think they can do it better? We think those right on the ground in our schools can do it better than taking direction from the Senate, the House, the White House, and the Department of Education in Washington, DC. 
   That is the opportunity we 100 Members of the Senate are going to be given very soon, I am convinced, by the action of a committee under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. JEFFORDS, and other dedicated members of that committee. I am disappointed the work they have been doing for the past couple of weeks has not gotten wider publicity and attention than it has received. I am now convinced that committee is going to present the most profound reform, the most hopeful new direction in the field of Federal education policy than we have received in a generation. 
   All 100 Members are going to have an opportunity to make those changes ourselves. I look forward to that opportunity. I congratulate the committee for the work it has already done.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to recognize the extraordinary efforts of one of my constituents, Ms. Tina Noble, to help women in her community market themselves to potential employers through the `Dress for Success' program. For her efforts, Tina Noble is one of the Washington Women 2000 ``Power of One'' Award recipients. 
   Dress for Success provides professional clothing for low-income women as they transition into the workplace. Many times these women are single mothers, trying to gain financial independence. Tina Noble, together with her small army of volunteers has helped over 500 women in the Seattle area get suited up for new jobs since she began the Seattle chapter of Dress for Success in 1998. 
   In addition to her community service, Tina is also a hero to her family as a wife and mother of three children. Tina is a wonderful example of the tremendous difference that one person can make in her community. I applaud Tina's efforts to help other women dress for and find success in the workplace. She is a most deserving recipient of the ``Power of One'' award.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I appear here today with my friend and colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER, to present to the Senate the  conference report on the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization measure. The compromise reached in this legislation is not only fair but constructive. It will provide necessary increases especially in capital funds for our aviation infrastructure and does provide a reasonable balance with the needs of that system and our limited Federal resources. 
   I went to the conference committee on this bill with a unique perspective because I sit on the Budget and Appropriations Committees as well as serving as the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. My duties on these committees allowed me to see the hard choices that must be made to stay within our tight budgets. 
   The final agreement reached with Chairman SHUSTER in the House ensures the trust fund revenues will be used for aviation spending. I joined Senator DOMENICI in supporting the Senate position on this issue, a position that allows for expenditure of these revenues for their intended purposes without tying the hands of the Appropriations Committee. That was an integral part of the final passage, and I commend Senator DOMENICI for his hard work on this issue, together with the tremendous contributions we received from Senator STEVENS. 
   One issue with which I have some reservations is amending the Death on the High Seas Act. I am pleased that the resolution amends the statute to bring the anachronistic law more up to date by allowing the recovery of certain types of non-economic damages. The resolution removes the cap on these damages contained in the Senate bill. I am also pleased that we have clearly retained the prohibition on punitive damages, which are not designed to compensate and which are so often abused. I think the resolution is good insofar as it reflects the Senate approach of keeping most aviation accidents on the high seas within the statute, thereby providing some semblance of certainty and uniformity. I have reservations, however, about the change demanded by the House conferees retroactively to change, from three to twelve nautical miles, the distance from the U.S. shore at which the Death on the High Seas act applies. Those who have wanted to take commercial aviation accident cases on the high seas out of DOHSA altogether have argued that this will cure the unfairness of different recoveries based on the chance of the accident happening over land or over the high seas. I have strongly disagreed with that proposition. Eliminating DOHSA leaves you with a dizzying array of State, Federal, foreign, or perhaps, no, law about which lawyers can fight endlessly, further postponing recovery. I trust those who have demanded that we complicate the federal law retroactively to take TWA Flight 800 litigation out of the coverage of DOHSA have fully considered the effects of that change. 
   My concerns with this issue are balanced with the positive aspects of this bill such as the removal of slot restrictions at Chicago O'Hare, Washington National, and the two New York airports. These provisions will improve competition, reduce fares, and provide additional service to small communities. 
   Another provision which will stimulate competition and help to bridge the funding gap that currently exists is an increase in the cap on the passenger facility charge. This provision gets to the heart of my guiding philosophy, which is to give local officials more decision-making power. 
   Although I favor an increase in the cap on the PFC, I realize that this is just one piece of the puzzle. We must look at the issues of our national aviation system in a larger context if we are going to meet the capacity demands of the 21st century. We cannot rely on unlimited federal funding to solve all of our problems. We must stretch our finite resources as far as possible. 
   A prime example of this is the modernization of the air traffic control system. This process has been ongoing for more than 15 years. We can no longer allow the program to continue the ``stops and starts'' of the past. Improvements must get on track, or, as the National Civil Aviation Review Commission warned us, the growing demand for air services combined with outdated equipment will soon bring gridlock and serious concerns about safety. 
   The Federal Aviation Commission needs to spare no effort over the next few years to modernize the air traffic control system. All of this needs to be done right, and be done now, to ensure continued safety and efficiency in the aviation industry. 
   Reforming the way in which the Federal Aviation Administration does business, and ensuring it is as efficient as possible, is a positive first step. This bill contains provisions, which I worked on with Senator ROCKEFELLER, to move the Federal Aviation Administration in the direction of being a more business-like entity. Positive reforms, not just increased funding, are integral to achieving our goal. 
   Although these reforms are a positive first step, I will continue to explore other possible options such as corporatization of the air traffic control system as the 2nd session of the 106th Congress continues. I believe we can learn from the work of countries such as Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, which have moved to privately run systems. The concerns of general aviation will be of paramount importance to me as this debate continues, and I welcome the input of all interested parties. 
   In summary, this agreement will allow both sides to reach our common goal, which is to ensure that we continue to have the safest, most efficient aviation system well into the 21st century. 
   I would like to take a minute to thank the Senate staff who worked tirelessly on this issue: Aviation subcommittee staff, Ann Choiniere, Mike Reynolds, Sam Whitehorn, and Julia Krauss ably tended the technical provisions of the bill. Wally Burnett with Senator STEVENS, and Cheryle Tucker with Senator DOMENICI were vital in negotiations over budgetary issues. 
   I also thank Jim Sartucci and Keith Hennessey from Senator LOTT's staff for assisting with the final negotiations. 
   Last but certainly not least are my own staff members. I thank Jeanne Bumpus for her diligent efforts on the Death on the High Seas Act, and Brett Hale, who is with me today, and who left his name out of these printed remarks. He deserves thanks for the hundreds and hundreds of hours he has put in on this bill from beginning to end. 
   Finally, as I began, I want to say it has been a great pleasure to me to work with my friend from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER, whose interest in this subject is very high and whose competence in coming up with correct answers is equally high. 
   This bill is a true partnership, and I have enjoyed working with him on coming up with these solutions on that score.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think we are quite close to the end of this debate. I wish to make only a few remarks, primarily in response to those of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, who spoke in opposition. 
   One reason this bill has taken so long to come before the Senate in the final conference report was an objection I shared with the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, and the majority leader to creating a new entitlement. 
   I do not believe, in the ultimate analysis, this bill does create a new entitlement. It does say that all of the money collected by the aviation passenger tax that has long been statutorily earmarked toward aircraft, airport, and airline purposes ought to be spent on that purpose. It does effectively guarantee that trust fund will be spent for the purposes it was created. That, it seems to me, is a good thing rather than a bad thing. 
   The Senator from New Jersey is correct in saying we will be required in the future, as I think we ought to be, to appropriate general fund money for aircraft purposes in the broadest sense. I suppose one can call that a subsidy to air travel. 
   The Senator speaks of Amtrak. My figures indicate that the roughly 20 million Amtrak passengers each year are subsidized by the general taxpayer to the extent of $28 per passenger per trip. Even if one assumed this bill would essentially require spending $2.5 million a year on the Federal Aviation Administration in general fund moneys over and above the trust fund, and even if we attributed every one of those dollars directly to the passengers of commercial aircraft, which of course we should not, that would be roughly $4 a passenger, or one-seventh the amount of subsidy to rail passengers. 
   The bottom line is that the Appropriations Committee still retains authority to shift funds among various capital accounts that are within the trust fund and still allow for a direct appropriation of whatever amount the Senate desires for general fund purposes. It will make it more difficult not to come up to authorized levels, but it does not make it impossible. 
   We all agree that the needs of our air transportation system are emergent and are large. This bill represents a major step forward to funding an adequate amount and will still allow judgments to be made between various forms of transportation and other needs of the country in an appropriate fashion. 
   This is a good bill, and I believe it ought to be passed with an overwhelmingly affirmative vote. 
   Has a rollcall vote been ordered on final passage?

   Mr. GORTON. I am here to address the issue of pipeline safety, an issue that people in most communities, cities, and towns do not concern themselves with unless, regretfully, a tragedy occurs, such as the one that took place in Bellingham, WA, last June. 
   The devastating liquid pipeline explosion that rocked the city of Bellingham and took the lives of three young boys rightfully served as a wakeup call and focused our attention on the need for pipeline safety reform. While pipelines continue to be the safest means of transporting liquid fuels and gas, and though accidents may be infrequent on the more than 2 million miles of mostly invisible pipelines in the United States, Bellingham has shown us that pipelines do pose potential dangers that we ignore at our peril. 
   In testifying on the Bellingham incident before a House committee last fall, I commented that while Congress had an obligation substantively to revise the Pipeline Safety Act in response to the clarion call for Bellingham, proposals for specific changes to the law seemed premature at that time. State and local officials in Washington State, as well as citizens groups, environmentalists, and various Federal oversight bodies, were just beginning to examine the accident and its causes. 
   The Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, has primary jurisdiction over this bill in the Senate, and last year I implored the chairman, Senator MCCAIN, and other committee members to make the reauthorization a top priority. Last week, at my request, the Commerce Committee scheduled the first Senate hearing on the topic of pipelines. 
   The field hearing to address the Bellingham incident and the State's response to it will be held in Bellingham, WA, next Monday, March 13. 
   I encourage my colleagues from the Senate Commerce Committee to come to Bellingham next Monday to hear firsthand testimony from the families of the victims and from local officials whose lives have been transformed by this tragedy. Theirs is a story which compels us to action. The families and the community will never forget what happened last June 10, nor should we in Congress. It is our duty to take the lessons learned in Bellingham and adopt tougher safety measures that will allow us to prevent future tragedies. 
   This hearing will, I hope, serve as guide as we debate the reauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act. And while a number of the studies and operational reviews commissioned after the accident are still incomplete, including those of the National Transportation Safety Board, on the cause of the accident in Bellingham and the report of the General Accounting Office as to the performance of the Office of Pipeline Safety, other reviews are complete. 
   Primary among these is the report of the Fuel Accident Prevention and Response Team, a task force convened by Governor Gary Locke and charged with reviewing Federal, State and local laws and practices affecting pipeline accident prevention and response. A significant contributor to this report was Mayor Mark Asmundson of Bellingham, whose efforts to learn from, educate others about, and rationally apply the lessons of that tragedy have been commendable. 
   The Fuel Accident Team recommended changes in law and practice at the Federal, State, and local levels. It revealed that there is a lot that can be done by State and local officials that is not being done, particularly in the area of emergency preparedness, public education, and adoption of appropriate set-back requirements to keep development away from lines. The Fuel Accident Team also found, however, that at least with respect to interstate pipelines, State and local officials are limited by Federal law from regulating many of the safety aspects of these lines, and that only the Federal Government can adopt or enforce requirements for inspection, emergency flow restriction devices, operator training, leak detection, corrosion prevention, maximum pressure, and other safety measures relevant to the safe construction, maintenance, and operation of pipelines. 
   While there may be good arguments that pipelines should be managed systemically and why inconsistent State standards could erode rather than promote safety, these arguments are fatally undermined by the absence of meaningful Federal standards. To tell State and local governments, as the Pipeline Safety Act effectively does, that they cannot require internal inspections of pipelines passing through their communities, under their schools and homes and senior centers, when 
   a Federal requirement for internal inspections is years overdue, strikes me as the worst kind of Federal conceit. 
   Amending the Pipeline Safety Act to relax Federal preemption and allow States to exceed minimum Federal safety standards was the first recommendation of Washington's Fuel Accident Team. Despite this recommendation, I understand that the administration's proposal for the reauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act will move in exactly the opposite direction, that is, it will propose to eliminate even the vague authority under which the Office of Pipeline Safety has appointed four States as its agents for purposes of inspecting interstate liquid pipelines. 
   The purported reason for further disempowering States is, I understand, OPS's perception that a system of inconsistent standards is unsafe, OPS's perception that a system of inconsistent standards is unsafe, and that States already have their hands full with regulating intrastate pipelines, which are far more extensive than interstate lines. But what if the States disagree with this attitude, which, in the absence of meaningful Federal standards is tantamount to saying that ``no standards are better than anything States can come up with''? 
   Yes, the interstate nature of some pipelines gives the Federal Government the option of regulating them and preempting States from doing so. If the Federal Government is not going to do its job, however, why should we prevent States from assuming responsibility for something as important as pipeline safety? 
   To its credit, in response to the Bellingham incident the Office of Pipeline Safety has proposed to complete a rulemaking on ``pipeline integrity'' by the end of this year. This rulemaking, years overdue, is not only supposed to address requirements for internal inspection and the use of emergency flow restriction devices in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas, but to adopt a systemic approach to pipeline safety that focuses not just on specific tests but on making sure that pipeline operators are accurately assessing risks, collecting and properly analyzing relevant data, and exercising sound judgment. Following the June 10 accident last year, the city of Bellingham conditioned the resumption of operations of a portion of the pipeline on the Olympic Pipe Line Company's adherence to certain process management standards borrowed from OSHA regulations applicable to oil refineries. This emphasis on a process management approach is, I believe, sound and should, I believe, be incorporated into any new Federal safety standards. 
   Once meaningful Federal standards for pipelines are in place, debate about  whether or not safety is advanced by allowing States to adopt and enforce stricter, but inconsistent standards, can begin. Even then, however, and certainly until then, I support the proposals in the legislation cosponsored in the House and Senate by all of the Washington delegation members to prescribe procedures for States to assume greater authority in the regulation of pipeline safety. Both H.R. 3558 and S. 2004 would permit States to apply for more regulatory authority from the Department of Transportation, which is charged with reviewing the proposals to ensure that states have the necessary resources and that the Balkanization of pipeline regulation will not degrade safety. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues from Washington to ensure that the following principles, many of which are reflected in the current S. 2004, are contained in the reauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act. 
   First, I support efforts to allow States greater authority to adopt and enforce safety standards for interstate pipelines, particularly is light of the absence of meaningful Federal standards. This increase in authority 
   should be accompanied by an increase in grants to States to carry out pipeline safety activities. 
   Second, I agree with Senator MURRAY that we need to improve the collection and dissemination of information about pipelines to the public and to local and State officials responsible for preventing and responding to pipeline accidents. We also need to ensure that operators are collecting information necessary accurately to assess risks and to respond. The public should be informed about where pipelines are located, what condition they are in, when they fail--we need to lower the threshold for reporting failures--and why they fail. We should ensure that relevant information is gathered and made available over widely accessible means like the Internet. 
   Third, in addition to providing an explicit mechanism for States to seek additional regulatory authority over interstate pipelines, Federal legislation should adopt some mechanism for ensuring that meaningful standards for pipeline testing, monitoring, and operation are adopted at the national level. Congress has directed the DOT to do some of this in the past. But as the Inspector General noted, some of the rulemakings are years overdue. To the extent that lack of funding can account for some of the delay we should ensure sufficient appropriations to allow OPS to complete the necessary rulemakings and develop the technology needed to conduct reliable tests of pipelines. 
   While I am reluctant to have Congress, rather than experts, prescribe specific testing and monitoring requirements, and while I fully appreciate the need for flexible testing regimes that recognize the differences among pipelines facing variable risks as well as the need for dynamic standards that advance with knowledge and technology, I am sympathetic to the position that specific mandates may be necessary in the face of inaction on the part of OPS. Congress has repeatedly asked OPS to conduct rulemakings and been ignored. As a consequence I can understand those who have lost patience and are prepared to put specific testing and operational prescriptions into Federal statute. 
   In addition to ensuring that OPS complies with years-old statutory mandates, I support the Inspector General's recommendation that OPS act upon, either to reject or accept, the recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board. I don't pretend to know whether NTSB's recommendations, that have been accumulating for years, will advance safety. It is unacceptable, however, that OPS should simply ignore them. 
   Fourth, I have heard from citizens' groups who support the creation of a model oversight oil spill advisory panel in Washington State. I see a real value in creating such a body, and empowering it with meaningful authority to comment on and influence State and Federal action or inaction. Such an advisory panel can continue to focus needed attention on the issue of pipeline safety when the painful memory of June 10 begins, for many, at the same time mercifully and regretfully, to fade.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill provides a generous contribution to the future of aviation in the 21st century. It significantly reforms the operations of the Federal Aviation Administration. It represents the collective wisdom of the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Commerce Committee, the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Aviation, and the majority and minority leaders of this Senate. We do not have many bills such as this. I commend it to my colleagues for passage.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will amend the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Program (YRBWEP), first approved by Congress in 1994 (PL 103-434). That legislation established a comprehensive framework for increasing critical flows in the Yakima River in order to reverse a longstanding trend of declining salmon and steelhead runs. 
   One portion of that legislation, Section 1208, authorized a specific project to electrify hydraulic turbines at the Chandler Pumping Plant near Prosser, Washington. By converting these pumps from hydraulic to electrical power, an additional 400 second feet of water would be added to a 12-mile stretch of the Yakima River below Prosser Dam called Chandler Reach. This project would increase survival rates and provide important new habitat for both the anadramous and resident fisheries in this critical section of the Yakima River. This electrification project is still a good approach to augmenting Yakima River flows, but early in its implementation an even better idea was developed that can nearly double the benefits projected from electrification. 
   This new approach could result in completely eliminating the need to divert water at Prosser Dam and Wanawish Dam for use by the Kennewick Irrigation District (K.I.D.) and the Columbia River Irrigation District (C.I.D.). This plan will require building a new pumping plant on the Columbia River and a pipeline to connect this new facility to K.I.D. This approach could add back to the Yakima River during critical flow periods the entire 759 second feet of water now diverted at Prosser Dam. This project might well be the key to the success of the rest of the YRBWEP program. For the extensive efforts being made farther upstream to be entirely successful, the lower sections of the Yakima River must provide the conditions necessary for salmon and steelhead to survive their journey to and from the upper river and its tributaries. The Chandler Reach and the lower Yakima must have sufficient water at the right time for anadromous fish to be able to transit this area. Without it, the programs upstream will be less effective. 
   The legislation I will introduce today authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to spend some of the funds previously authorized for the electrification project to develop this new approach. There are several studies and undertakings necessary to determine with certainty the efficacy and cost of this pump exchange project. These include carrying out a feasibility study, including an estimate of project benefits, an environmental impact analysis, and preparing a feasibility level design and cost estimate as well as securing critical right-of-way areas and such other studies as may be required. 
   This change in approach to enhancing flows in the lower Yakima is enthusiastically supported by the resource agencies of the State of Washington, including the Washington State Department of Ecology, as well as by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and many other primary stakeholders on the Yakima River, such as the Yakama Indian Nation. To date all organizations and agencies contacted want to see the necessary work done to develop this project further, and this legislation will provide the crucial resources to complete the feasibility and engineering studies. 
   By Mr. KENNEDY.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the extremely generous and thoughtful gift for the education of our nation's children that was announced today by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Although relatively young, the Foundation already has a track record of making significant contributions for the sharing of new technologies and improving the educational opportunities of all our children. For example, in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates provided $1 billion to establish the Gates Millennium Scholars program, which will provide scholarships for academically talented minority students who would otherwise not have the financial resources to attend college. 
   Today, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will announce a new gift of approximately $350 million, and more than $200 million of this gift will be directed to Washington state schools and districts. This gift is comprised of a series of grants that are designed to raise academic standards and help all students meet those standards. 
   The grants are broken into two elements. The first is a series of grants for the development state, district, school and classroom leadership. Our educators are doing an outstanding job teaching our children. This funding, however, will give our teachers even more support and enhance their education which will in turn improve the education of our students. This series of grants consists of $100 million for state challenge grants for Leadership Development, $45 million for the Teacher Leadership Project, and $25 million for national teacher training and teacher quality initiatives. 
   The second series of grants will encourage the development of model schools and districts. Throughout our state, educators and school administrators have hundreds of innovative and creative ideas to improve education. With this funding, educators can turn  their ideas into reality and implement new solutions and ways to teach. This series of grants consist of the $30 million Washington State School Grant Program which will serve approximately 140 schools, and the $150 million School District Grant Program which includes $50 million for 10-11 districts in Washington State. 
   Finally, the Foundation is providing the Seattle School District with a $26 million grant that will assist the district in its use of technology to help students meet Washington state's challenging academic standards. 
   I'm sure my colleagues join me in thanking Bill and Melinda Gates for their significant and considerate contribution to education. I know that current and future generations of students will benefit greatly from this gift. The education of our children is the key to the success of our country and the Gateses have given all of our students an even greater chance of succeeding.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to announce the winner of my 33rd Innovation in Education Award. This award goes to a national group sponsored by Boston Public Radio titled ``From the Top.'' I learned about this program when I attended a ``From the Top'' performance in Spokane on January 29th. Two students from Washington state, Stephen Beus of Othello and Justin Mackewich of Vancouver, participated in the concert and I was amazed by their technique and their immense talent. I was delighted to see such outstanding students excelling in the arts and am pleased to award Stephen and Justin and recognize this exceptional program. 
   Both Stephen and Justin are very gifted musicians. I was amazed by Stephen's skill at the piano and the Four Seasons Quartet that Justin played in was astounding. I hope to attend more of their concerts in the future. 
   ``From the Top'' consists of a series of public radio performances, taped in front of live audiences. These performances have been given across the country in places like Boston, New York City, Sarasota, Florida, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The concept for ``From the Top'' is to highlight the performances of exceptional, pre-college age, classical musicians. Indeed, their performances make a ``From the Top'' concert a remarkable experience. 
   An additional positive impact of ``From the Top'' is that it provides an arena for people of all ages to enjoy classical music. In today's modern world, we must take the time to enjoy the classics and encourage our youth to value the great symphonies and music from the past. ``From the Top'' is an excellent source for all ages and walks of life to learn more about classical music. 
   Each week, I give an ``Innovation in Education'' Award to individuals or groups within the education system who make outstanding contributions to the education of our children. I believe that ``From the Top'' gives our students exposure to the arts that provides an invaluable enrichment to any child's upbringing. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the great contributions of ``From the Top''.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my ardent support for passage of the Iran Nonproliferation Act. It is very likely that this legislation will pass the Senate by a margin matching or nearing the unanimous 419 to 0 vote in the House of Representatives last September. 
   The importance of this legislation should not be lost amid the widespread acclamation with which it will be sent to the President. This bill is aimed at controlling the transfer or sale of technology and expertise to Iran, especially from Russia, that will assist in its development of weapons of mass destruction and missiles designed to deliver these weapons. 
   This is a very real, very well-documented and very serious security concern for the United States and Israel, our nation's most-trusted ally in the Middle East. The Central Intelligence Agency has reported Iran has the capability to launch a missile that will reach Israel, and it is well known that Iran is pursuing development of nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry. 
   The Iran Nonproliferation Act provides for biannual reports on who around the world is transferring prohibited technology or information to Iran, and allows the President to take action against persons or entities found to be engaged in such activity. This bill also includes new steps to ensure the Russian Space Agency, which is a partner with NASA in the International Space Station project, is complying with Russia's official Iran anti-proliferation policy. 
   Media reports on the Iran election, held only days ago, show an encouraging shift in the attitudes of the Iranian people, a trend that we should applaud and encourage. Unfortunately, the structure of the Iranian government and its police services may well frustrate the will of the Iranian people, and the quest of its armed forces for weapon and missile technology proceeds apace. I look forward to the day on which Iran will be a good and peaceful neighbor. That day may be closer, but it has not yet arrived. 
   This bill is a necessary step towards our goal of nonproliferation and certainly merits a high level of bipartisan support, as well as the signature of President Clinton.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Friday, Oregon governor John Kitzhaber announced his support for a radical Clinton-Gore administration proposal to begin dismantling the Columbia-Snake hydroelectric system by removing four hydroelectric dams in southeastern Washington. That same day, in Seattle, campaigning for president, Bill Bradley also announced his support for this proposal. 
   Is support for destroying the Columbia hydro system now a litmus test for the Democratic Party and its candidates for public office? I hope not, because the importance of salmon recovery and the value of our Northwest hydro system is too important to every family and community in our region. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration--most prominently through Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt--has aggressively advocated dismantling dams. Specifically, the administration has devoted significant agency resources to study removal of the four Snake River dams in Washington. Even the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has publicly endorsed dam-breaching. Several other agencies list it as a serious ``option'' to recovery Pacific Northwest salmon.  
   I will state here again--as I have many times already--no proposal to remove Snake or Columbia River dams will pass in Congress while I am Senator. I know that my colleagues, Senator GORDON SMITH of Oregon, Senator MIKE CRAPO and Senator LARRY CRAIG, as well as Governor Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho share my view. 
   In addition, last year, Republican members in the House for Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Alaska--led by my friend Congressman Doc Hastings--co-sponsored a House resolution expressing opposition to the removal of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Scores of Washington State Senators and state legislators appeared at a rally last year in support of the dams. And unlike the Democratic presidential candidates, my friend governor George W. Bush has stated that he would not approve of such a proposal. 
   I particularly commend Governor Gary Locke for stating his opposition to this unwise position. Governor Locke has been especially courageous and thoughtful in representing the best interest of his constituents in spite of the criticism of many of his own supporters. Removing dams from the Columbia hydro system is bad policy. It is bad for people. It costs too much. And the value to salmon is highly questionable. What is certain is that dam removal will make the Northwest a dirtier place to live as it will put tens of thousands of added trucks on the road and as clean hydro power is replaced with coal or gas burning energy. 
   The case against breaching the Snake River dams is bolstered by evidence found in the Corps of Engineers own feasibility study. The Corps found that with existing dam conditions, the average survival rate through all four dams and reservoirs on the Snake River for juvenile salmon is already over 80 percent, and for adult salmon is 88-94 percent. In addition, in the dozens of appendices, summaries, charts, glossy brochures, and documents, there is little, if any, concrete, verifiable biological or scientific data in the Corps' study that shows that the removing even one inch of these dams would restore salmon runs. 
   At the same time, much of the Corps' own evidence in the feasiblity study verifies that the economic and social effects caused by dam breaching would be devastating to the region. The Corps' cost estimates, which are unrealistically low, assume that the economic impact measured in lowered farmland values, pump modification costs, and irrigation wells would exceed $230 million. 
   Replacing lost hydropower with other energy forms would increase electricity costs to local ratepayers by as much as $291 million per year. And increased highway and rail traffic costs would cost industries an additional $24 million per year, and $100 to $200 million a year to replace barging with trucking and rail. On top of that, the government, through your taxpayer dollars, would have to find an estimated $1 billion just to accomplish the job of removing the dams. 
   Throughout the study, the Corps acknowledges that breaching the dams would have an adverse effect on the environment, resident fish and wildlife, clean air, higher water temperatures, specifically through 50 to 75 million cubic yards of eroding sediment, increased dust and emissions from replacing hydroelectric power with natural gas, and increased annual pollution and safety concerns from highway and rail traffic. 
   What the Corps didn't say in the study is that today, the Columbia and Snake Rivers provide a transportation corridor that moves more than $13 billion in cargo comprised of exports and imports to and from 43 states. This system in 1997 alone handled 43 percent of all U.S. wheat exports and 11 percent of U.S. corn exports. That's a significant amount of food for the world that would have to be transported in other ways. 
   All of this comes at a time when the Bonneville Power Administration is reporting impending energy shortages for the Pacific Northwest and the Secretary of the Energy is traveling to the Middle East to try for cheaper oil to counteract increasing gasoline and oil prices. 
   Also lost on this administration and other dam removal advocates is the fact that salmon populations are declining everywhere including in watersheds where there are no dams. The National Academy of Sciences studied Northwest salmon issues and found that in river basins like the Chehalis basin and the Willapa basin where there are no dams, the decline of salmon populations, per capita, is identical to that of the Columbia River. Native salmon runs on the East Coast are in more serious decline than many in the Pacific Northwest and yet almost none of those salmon runs are from rivers containing hydroelectric dams. But are we still to believe that destroying the Columbia hydro system is necessary to save salmon? 
   And let's be clear about one more thing. Today, the dam removal advocates focus only on four dams that generate power for BPA on the Snake River. But let nobody be fooled. They and their political allies among the national environmental groups mean to destroy more of the Columbia hydro system than just these four dams. 
   If removing these four dams on the Snake River--dams containing fish passage facilities--is necessary to comply with the Endangered Species Act and other laws, then surely, Grand Coulee Dam without fish passage facilities blocking hundreds of miles of pristine salmon habitat must come down. Perhaps the Oregon Governor can explain why Oregon's Hells Canyon dam on the Snake River and with no fish passage capacity can survive under his criteria. 
   This debate is about preserving or dismantling the Columbia River hydro system. I will fight to preserve this system and fight to restore salmon runs within the context of this system. 
   I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last month I had the pleasure of visiting Wind River Middle School in Stevenson, WA. One of the reasons why the students at this school excel is because of its teachers and the commitment they demonstrate each day in their classrooms. One of the teachers who has made a tremendous impact on the education of her students is Ms. Traci Eccles. Ms. Eccles is a dedicated professional, a staff leader, a team player and most importantly, a teacher who encourages her students to grow. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Eccles' commitment to her students and award her with my 32d Innovation in Education Award. 
   As a teacher of language arts to 7th and 8th grade students for more than a decade, she is constantly working to improve the lives of her students. She has also teamed up with her colleagues to create school-wide programs on topics such as health and nutrition, student tolerance, and a hands-on study of the respective decades of the 20th century. 
   Six years ago, Ms. Eccles and her colleagues wanted to create more tolerance amongst their students and started a program to examine intolerance in the world and its impact. Eighth grade students must read a book by Elie Weisel, titled ``Night,'' that tells the stories of human suffering and degradation during the Holocaust. The students must also keep journals and take part in discussions of current events. 
   Student reaction to the Tolerance Unit has been profound. At the end of the unit, teachers can see a much higher level of awareness among students reflected in how they treat and respond to each other. I applaud Ms. Eccles and her colleagues for taking the initiative and developing a program that has impacted their students such a positive way. 
   In addition, Ms. Eccles took on another project to give students a first-hand look at their country's history through a program called the Decades Unit. The entire school is divided into different groups and participates in a week long program where students put together historical fashion shows, learn and perform popular dances of each decade, and create a time-line outlining significant events in United States history. 
   Ms. Eccles' great work deserves our recognition. Through their creative ideas, dedication and hard work, Ms. Eccles and her fellow teachers have improved the lives of our children and created a greater sense of community and togetherness in their school. 
   My many visits to schools around Washington state have shown me that the people who see our kids everyday are the ones who should have the greatest say in their education. It is teachers like Ms. Eccles who are both the true strength of our education system and who can prepare our kids with a foundation for the future. I will continue my work to give teachers like Ms. Eccles more freedom to innovate and improve the lives of our children.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to read portions of a proposed regulation found on page 173 of the January 3, 2000, issue of the Federal Register:  
   ``[I]t is important that individuals alter their daily behaviors,'' ``and for governmental entities to seek programmatic incentives, public education, regulatory changes, or other approaches.'' 
   ``Daily behaviors'' are further defined as ``Individual decisions about energy consumption for heating, travel, and other purposes;'' and ``individual maintenance of residences or gardens.''  
   Those passages come directly from a ``4(d)'' Endangered Species Act regulation for the Pacific Northwest proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The rule states flatly these are examples of activities that could kill salmon or steelhead through water, air, and ocean pollution, and that NMFS ``might or might not'' seek to regulate them as such under the rule. 
   Taken literally, if these rules are enacted as written, National Marine Fisheries Service could regulate how often individuals drive their cars, where and how property owners could plant or fertilize their lawns, gardens, or farm crops. They could dictate the content of county zoning, public works, building, and road ordinances, and possibly even suggest limits on the setting of thermostats in homes or public school classrooms, or the operation of public transit buses--all to protect salmon. 
   Washington citizens, and those in other Northwest States, would be asked to make a host of changes in their daily lives, but unfortunately, could be assured of nothing except for the certainty that a greater portion of their tax dollars would fund the salaries of even more Federal bureaucrats to draft more rules and regulations of this nature. This year, the National Marine Fisheries Service is asking  Congress to fund 41 new employees just to implement its West Coast salmon recovery plan. 
   Those proposals would represent a striking power grab by unelected bureaucrats if they were absolutely necessary to save whole species of salmon. But they are not. As I said in a letter to President Clinton 2 weeks ago, the Federal Government should be seeking to encourage and promote incentives for States, tribes, and local entities and private groups to come up with creative solutions to save salmon, not make it more difficult for them. 
   And that is exactly what these rules do. The rules go far beyond telling hundreds of farmers in the Methow Valley that they cannot exercise their water rights to irrigate their crops until they have National Marine Fisheries Service-approved fish screens installed at their own expense, as the agency told my constituents in north central Washington last year. 
   They would go beyond holding up the construction of bridges in Columbia County or cities' efforts to install stop lights, as the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon regulatory process has already done. 
   In short, these rules, if enacted as proposed, would be likely to slow down local salmon recovery efforts, rather than ``increasing people's flexibility in complying with the Endangered Species Act,'' as the National Marine Fisheries Service publicly claimed in mid-December. More Federal bureaucracy simply will not help local communities and private groups protect salmon and steelhead. 
   I also notice that the National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed a narrow set of exemptions within the rules, which could make the enforcement of the rule arbitrary and unfair against those who don't meet their stated criteria. The Oregon Department of Transportation, for example, would be in compliance with the rule in carrying out its road maintenance activities on roads abutting streams, because that agency agreed to implement special National Marine Fisheries Service-approved training for its road maintenance crews. No such exemption exists in the rule for private land owners anywhere or the Washington Department of Transportation to carry on the same activities. 
   The people of Washington State realized the importance of not allowing endangered salmon and steelhead runs to go extinct long before any Federal agency told them they should modify their own ``daily behavior'' as part of the effort. The only ``daily behavior'' that local salmon enhancement groups are concerned with in Washington right now is to restore salmon and steelhead runs right in the streams and rivers near where they live and work. And they are doing it. 
   Look, for example, at the successful efforts of the variety of agricultural, business, and tribal groups who formed the Skagit Watershed Council to produce an on-the-ground science-based strategy for prioritizing local habitat recovery projects. They came together, often disagreeing on other issues, but to work together on the most productive salmon recovery efforts--without the Federal Government telling them to do so. 
   Then there are the successful efforts of Long Live the Kings on the Wishkah River on Grays Harbor County, where low-tech, inexpensive habitat restoration methods helped double the returns of natural spawning salmon there in 1 year. 
   A captive brook stock facility was built with $1 million in private funds on Lilliwaup Creek on Hood Canal, and already the State of Washington has looked to that success in restoring the very most threatened local wild salmon runs. I can cite several more examples, but suffice it to say that local efforts are underway, and we should congratulate their efforts to proactively and successfully preserve salmon. 
   Proposing regulations of this sort, at the very least, would be putting the ``cart before the horse.'' The National Marine Fisheries Service must come forward with concrete goals of how many fish they intend to recover throughout the Northwest in areas they call ``evolutionary significant units.'' This is something that Congress asked the National Marine Fisheries Service to do in an appropriations conference report last year. The National Marine Fisheries Service was directed to determine and set numerical goals for Puget Sound areas by July 1 of this year, and, by then, to set a schedule for establishing numerical goals for all other areas in Washington State. 
   Why is this important? Well, very simply put: How can you mandate means, mandate lifestyle changes, before you know what you are trying to accomplish? In my view, having these numerical goals is critical to guiding the agency in any effort it makes to enforce 4(d) rules to protect threatened species. 
   Unfortunately, not only has the National Marine Fisheries Service failed to provide the required numerical goals for salmon species, it has yet to deliver the actual funding to the State. Last year, Congress approved $18 million to be provided directly by the National Marine Fisheries Service to the Washington State Salmon Recovery Board, so that the board could distribute funds for State and local salmon recovery projects, as well as fund implementation of the Washington Forest and Fish Agreement, which was authorized by the 
   State legislature. I am disturbed to learn that the National Marine Fisheries Service has not yet secured arrangements to distribute these much-needed funds to the State of Washington. As a result, the National Marine Fisheries Service is holding up State and local efforts to comply with the Endangered Species Act. 
   Even without funding, several counties and salmon enhancement groups throughout Washington have been working on their own plans to comply with ESA requirements. Many smaller counties, however, simply do not have the resources to meet the National Marine Fisheries Service process under the rules. They are nevertheless expected to scramble to come up with their own ordinances that will be ultimately reviewed and approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure that they are ``adequate to help conserve anadromous salmonids.'' 
   Aside from my concerns with the way these rules are written, I am not at all pleased that the National Marine Fisheries Service has decided to refuse even a modest extension of the public comment period, and has stated publicly that it wants to enact this rule by July. 
   Keep in mind, these lengthy, 20 plus page rules were only printed for the first time in the Federal Register about 5 weeks ago. After tonight, the public hearings process will already have been slammed shut. 
   That is why when I learned that the regional director of the National Marine Fisheries Service had scheduled all five of Washington's public hearings on these lengthy and complex rules within just a 7-day period, I asked for more opportunities for citizens to be heard. Most of the five hearings were so full of interested citizens that not everyone could find a chair or be given adequate time to have a face to face question and answer period with the very bureaucrats who want to have the authority proposed in these rules. 
   While the National Marine Fisheries Service recently agreed to two additional hearings scheduled on the same day and time, they flatly refused to extend the comment process, stating that ``a longer extension to the public comment period would not be likely to provide any new information, and would delay implementation of the rules, which the National Marine Fisheries Service feels are necessary for salmon conservation.'' It is disturbing that while they are often criticized for being too slow to process permit requests, when it comes to listening to people on highly controversial proposals, they can't move fast enough to enact them into law. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service owes the citizens of Washington and the Pacific Northwest a more responsible handling of their duties to enforce the Endangered Species Act. Section 2(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act requires the National Marine Fisheries Service to cooperate with State and local agencies to protect endangered species. I believe the National Marine Fisheries Service cannot fairly force rules and local and State agencies without first establishing the goals and objectives requested by Congress last year. I renew the request made by the appropriations conference for the National Marine Fisheries Service to provide the numerical goals and objectives for Puget Sound salmon, to provide a  framework for similar numerical goals and objectives for the rest of Washington and the Pacific Northwest, and to establish performance standards for salmon recovery projects. And they should do so before they enact these rules. 
   I conclude my comments by noting that any proposal which would regulate ``daily behavior'' certainly requires closer scrutiny than 30 days of public hearings and 30 more days of written comments. I commend those Washington citizens who are now working hard on local-based solutions to protect salmon, and offer them my full and continued support for the successful course they are taking to rebuild and restore salmon. I am concerned that the Federal Government, with rules drafted in this manner, would not help these on-the-ground local efforts. I will continue to call on Federal agencies not to dictate how best to accomplish ESA compliance. I request that the National Marine Fisheries Service address the valid concerns I and others raise regarding these proposals and to do so before they begin implementing these sweeping regulations.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it was just last week that I came to the floor of the Senate to share a legal brief outlining the weakness of the Department of Justice's case against Microsoft. But I repeated at that time a thought I have expressed several times on the floor of the Senate that perhaps the most long-lasting effect of this ill-begotten lawsuit would be on the U.S. international competitiveness and our place in the world that is changing so rapidly due to the development of both software and hardware in the computer industry and in the related high-tech fields. Yesterday, the other shoe dropped. The European Union announced an antitrust investigation against Microsoft, something, as I say, that I have been predicting for more than a year. 
   When the Department of Justice was asked about it, it said this action took them by surprise. I don't know why we should be surprised that the European Union is very much interested in restricting access of U.S. goods and services in Europe, whether they are software, airplanes, bananas, or a wide range of other goods and services, or why the Department of Justice should be surprised that the European Union investigates and reflects its own actions in a matter of this sort. In fact, the report of this lawsuit points out that it is easier to bring an antitrust case in Europe than it is in the United States. 
   We have simply opened up to European competitors the opportunity to cripple or destroy one of the most innovative and progressive of all U.S. corporations, one that bears a very significant share of the credit for the magnificent performance of our economy and for the changes in our lives. 
   Again, as is the case with the Microsoft action by the U.S. Department of Justice, this European investigation seems to have been sparked by an American competitor, even more perhaps than the European authorities themselves. But nothing but ill can come from investigations or actions of this sort. 
   This industry and our economy has grown because it is highly innovative, highly competitive, and very rapidly changing. Neither our antitrust laws nor European antitrust laws fit that very well--the Europeans probably less than our own, as they represent views in an economy that has been for generations far more stagnant than our own. 
   In any event, Mr. President, I regret to have to bring this matter to your attention and to the attention of my colleagues. But I have feared exactly this for more than a year. I fear that it will breed other copycat actions in other parts of the world that would also like to grab for free the innovations and progress that have meant so much to the United States and that are so important in reducing what is now the largest bilateral trade deficit in our history or in the world. 
   This is bad news. But it is bad news that is brought upon us largely by the ill-advised and ill-founded actions against Microsoft by our own U.S. Department of Justice.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I was sitting in the seat the Presiding Officer is occupying about an hour ago when the junior Senator from New York regaled the Senate with his views on education in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   He did me a great honor to denounce my proposal, Straight A's, rather specifically. But it did seem to me to be a strange and inverted world in which Straight A's, a proposal designed to empower education authorities such as parents, teachers, and superintendents--the very people who know our students by their first names--to say, somehow or another, this was an attack on local authority but that the issuance of thousands of pages of regulations, on hundreds of different individual categorical aid programs, at the Department of Education in Washington, DC, was somehow liberating. 
   The Senator from New York criticized our present education system as a failure, a statement with which I do not agree. I believe there are many improvements necessary, but my own experience, in literally dozens of schools over the last 2 or 3 years, has shown a tremendous dedication to better teaching methods, to the education of our children, to innovation, changes that I want to encourage. 
   In fact, if we look for something to criticize as a failure, we need look no further than the present Federal education system itself. Title I has now been in effect for 35 years. The difference in achievement between the kids it is designed to help and the less underprivileged children is as great as it was when the program began. Yet what we have from the Senator from New York and the Senator from Massachusetts is to have more of exactly what has failed and that perhaps 
   what is really lacking is sufficient direction from Washington, DC. 
   I do not claim to be an expert on what is needed for a higher and better education in the city of New York or in any other New York school district. However, I don't think the Senator from New York knows more about what the schools in my State need--I won't even say that I do--than the superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents of students in my own State. 
   What we seek--and this will be the great debate that will take place in this body in less than a month--will be: Do we trust the people who have dedicated their lives and careers to educating our children, to make the fundamental decisions about what they need in 17,000 school districts across the country and hundreds of thousands of individual schools or do we believe they need total supervision and control in Washington, DC, in the bureaucracy in the U.S. Department of Education? 
   We have increasingly followed that lateral line now for 35 years. It is a dead-end street. That is what has failed to work in connection with our education system. 
   For the first time, with the minor exception of the Ed-Flex bill we passed last year, we seek to restore some of that authority to our local school districts, to our teachers, and to our parents. That is what Straight A's is all about. 
   I suppose I should be honored to have my own program attacked specifically and by name because I think that means it is making very real progress. I know it is at home, whenever I go to a school or to a school administration building and discuss its ideas. Our teachers and our educators want more authority to make up their minds as to what their children need. Those needs are not the same in every school district. Not every school district has as its highest priority more teachers. Not every school district has as its highest priority more bricks and mortar. Not every school district has as its highest priority teacher education. Not every school district has as its highest priority more computers. But many school districts have any one of those as a highest priority, and many have some other. Each of them ought to be permitted, each of them ought to be encouraged, to make those decisions for the students. 
   A final point. The Senator from New York attacked this proposal as lacking accountability. We certainly have accountability now. The way our schools account for the spending of money under hundreds of present school programs is by filling out forms and by  being visited by auditors who make a precise determination as to whether $10 for one purpose has been used for some other purpose or not. It is a form of accountability that has required our school districts to spend more and more money on administrators and on filling out forms and less and less money on educating the students themselves. 
   We substitute for that one ultimate form of accountability, accountability measured by whether or not our students are doing better, by whether or not our kids are getting a better education. No State may gain the benefit from the provisions of Straight A's unless that State agrees to a form of testing, of actual achievement of the students, and promising if it is given this flexibility, those student achievement standards will rise, scores will rise in the period under which they are working with Straight A's. 
   It is neither more complicated nor more simple than that. 
   The goal of educating our children is to see to it that they are prepared for the world in which they will live. We are now able more and more to measure how those goals are met. Do our students read better? Do they write better? Do they compute better? The accountability in Straight A's is measured by those standards, not by how well their administrators and teachers fill out forms and not how well they come out in an after-the-fact audit. 
   I have every confidence that as a part of the very important debate over education and the renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will debate Straight A's. I am convinced as this body finishes its work it will be a part of the most constructive and most successful renewal of our activity in the field of education that this Congress has accomplished in generations.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce the Electric Reliability 2000 Act, a measure that deals with the somewhat mysterious world of the bulk electricity system. Although most Americans are not experts on the intricacies of interstate electric transmission grids, they need to have confidence that the system will work and their lights and heat will be there when they need them. 
   This nation's interstate electric transmission system is an extremely complex network that connects with Canada and Mexico. It has developed over decades with various voluntary agreements that allow areas to work together depending on changing power needs that vary from day to day and hour to hour and sometimes minute to minute. These voluntary agreements were developed after a disastrous event in 1965 led to a blackout in New York City and throughout other parts of the Northeast. 
   Yet a fundamental change has made this voluntary system unworkable for the future. With the expansion of competition in the wholesale electricity market--starting with the 1992 Energy Policy Act--the system of buying and selling wholesale power is now many times more complex than it was just a decade ago. With a stronger economy, electricity usage has increased while thousands of new electricity marketers and buyers have created new stresses on the system. 
   These stresses to the system have affected many parts of the country. In August 1996, a sagging power line in Oregon made contact with a tree, and combined with other factors led to a power outage that affected over 7 million consumers along the West Coast. Other outages have occurred in different parts of the country since that time. 
   To address this situation, more than a year ago a group of electricity industry officials began meeting to develop legislative language needed in this new era in electricity. They developed provisions that have been included as a small part of several bills, including the larger restructuring bills developed in the House and by the Clinton administration. 
   Events in recent months have lent urgency to this issue. I believe it is time to separate the issue of electricity reliability from the larger issue of restructuring. Our continued economic growth is fueled by electricity, and we need to assure the public that the power will be there for their homes and their jobs when they count on it. 
   The stresses in the system continue to mount. In the summer of 1999, Americans experienced a wide-range of severe electricity outages. The Department of Energy created a team of experts to investigate these outages, and it submitted its report last month. I quote from the report's summary:  
   In anticipation of competitive markets, some utilities have adopted a strategy of cost cutting that involves reduced spending on reliability. In addition, responsibility for reliability management has been disaggregated to multiple institutions, with utilities, independent system operators, independent power producers, customers, and markets all playing a role. The overall effect has been that the infrastructure for reliability assurance has been considerably eroded.  
   The report continues:  
   Moreover, historical levels of electric reliability may not be adequate for the future. The quality of electric power and the assurance that it will always be available are increasingly important in a society that is ever more dependent on electricity.  
   The report includes several findings that suggest a range of policy questions that need to be addressed in order to assure the reliability of the Nation's bulk power system. 
   The bill I introduce today includes what has been termed the ``consensus language'' that was developed over the past year by these experts who work on the reliability side of the electricity industry. This bill is not the complete solution to the reliability issue for this industry. It is a good starting point. It creates a process to develop enforceable rules for the bulk-power system, while giving various regions the ability to tailor these rules in ways that make sense for their individual systems and their specific geography. 
   In addition to setting up rules and a referee to enforce these rules, ``reliability'' also involves many other facets of the electricity industry that are not addressed in this bill: full and open access to transmission systems, effective conservation programs that can help reduce peak system demands, the ability to site electricity generation plants closer to the loads they serve, promoting small-scale distributed generation, such as fuel-cells, throughout the grid, and many other wide-ranging actions. Until we can gain a greater consensus of the need to address these issues, this bill provides the opportunity to begin these discussions. 
   Despite being described as a consensus bill, there may need to be changes to this legislative language so that it is effective. For example, there are ongoing discussions about the appropriate role for State regulators as their responsibilities relate to the interstate transmission system. Therefore I respectfully request Chairman MURKOWSKI to conduct hearings on this serious issue of the reliability of the bulk power system and also to hold hearings on this bill as the starting point for solving this problem.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as I have traveled throughout Washington State, meeting with parents and educators, I have learned about the unique needs that exist in each of our school districts. One of those challenges is teaching children who speak English as their second language. In Vancouver, Washington, Jason Lee Middle School has created a program called the Jason Lee English Transition System (JETS) that tackles this challenge head on and not only teaches English, but also identifies exceptional and special needs students and helps them to excel. I am proud to present my 32nd ``Innovation in Education'' award to the JETS program of Vancouver's Jason Lee Middle School. 
   Twenty-five percent of Jason Lee's students are English Language Learners [ELL] and speak 14 different languages. A majority of these students speak either Russian, Ukrainian, or Spanish, creating a diverse student body and enhancing every child's education. When a child begins to learn English at Jason Lee, they do not immediately enter mainstream classes and instead are taught in their native language to demonstrate their math and reading levels. Students must also go through an intensive instruction in English before they are brought into general education classes. This advance preparation means that ELL students are greeted with a more inclusive atmosphere and will have a greater understanding of their classes and coursework. 
   Another challenge that faces students new to the United States is understanding American culture while maintaining ties to their own native culture. The JETS program also recognizes this difficult adjustment by putting a great emphasis on encouraging both the celebration of the native culture and in actively encouraging parental involvement. 
   In addition, JETS has taken the further step of working to not only provide these students with a smooth transition into English, but it goes one step further and identifies gifted students and students with special needs. Too often, programs for non-English speaking students struggle to identify children needing special attention. Clearly, JETS has addressed that obstacle and serves as a model for school districts struggling with the same challenges. 
   The JETS program does not just teach students English, it identifies and addresses the many issues that a child new to this country must suddenly deal with and seeks an understanding of each student's learning level. I applaud the teachers and staff at Jason Lee Middle School for developing the JETS program which demonstrates the innovation and creativity that is happening in our schools today. I congratulate Jason Lee Middle School for its outstanding work in this field of education.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I had the pleasure--or displeasure--of being in Seattle during the now infamous World Trade Organization meeting last fall, shortly after Congress adjourned for the year. The images broadcast via the airwaves portrayed a negative image of Seattle and a narrow view of the debate in this country surrounding free trade. The spectacle of the ``Battle in Seattle'' that most of us saw on the evening news also did not accurately represent the full experience that law enforcement officers on the street endured. These officers suffered through appalling work conditions largely attributable to poor planning by public officials responsible for such preparation. In spite of these conditions, the incidents of confrontation and violence were kept to a surprising minimum. These fine men and women in law enforcement deserve recognition for their vigilance, their restraint, and their dedication. 
   Officers, wearing 60-70 pounds of tear gas drenched equipment, were forced to stand the line with minimal rest, no bathroom facilities, and little food--for shifts of 16 to 17 hours. Given the fact that officers endured a continual barrage of insults and projectiles from out-of-control protestors, I am surprised that there were not more instances where frustration and exhaustion temporarily superceded discipline and training. It is a credit to the men and women of the Seattle Police Department, the King County Sheriff's Office, the Washington State Patrol, and the many officers from other localities, that their restraint kept a bad situation from becoming much, much worse. 
   As with any confrontational event involving thousands of people, mistakes were made by both sides. It is clear, however, that the law enforcement officers involved with the WTO in Seattle overwhelmingly exhibited professionalism and conduct above and beyond the call of duty--for that they should be commended. To the officers who, against great odds, did everything they could to preserve peace and order, I offer my sincere thanks.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in November I had the pleasure of joining a unique group of students on a field trip to Coppei Creek outside of Walla Walla, Washington. The Advanced Placement biology class from Walla Walla high school, led by their teacher Anne Swant, has been engaged in an innovative program to study wild steelhead restoration and monitor water quality. 
   The Coppei Creek project is a collaboration between the Walla Walla conservation district, Tri-State Steelheaders, City of Waitsburg, and local landowners. This group came together after severe flooding damaged property and habitat in 1996. Their goal was to restore stream habitat for threatened steelhead while providing necessary flood control for adjacent farmlands. 
   As part of the ``Four Schools'' project Anne Swant's class has teamed up with John Geidl, a retired educator and executive secretary of Tri-State Steelheaders, to institute a ``classrooms in the stream'' project--teaching biology and scientific research techniques through real-life applications. 
   In addition to the work at Coppei Creek, the students helped design and construct in-stream habitat and riparian buffers for a fish-bearing stream on their own school campus. 
   For their leadership in this revolutionary program, I was proud to award Anne Swant and John Geidl one of my ``Innovation in Education'' awards for excellence and creativity in hands-on science learning and leadership in teaching community conservation. 
   This program, and the Coppei Creek restoration project are models of locally-driven conservation and education initiatives. This community has taken it upon itself, without unnecessary pressure from Washington DC bureaucrats, to engage in salmon habitat restoration and use it as an educational experience for future stewards of this precious resource. 
   Clearly, a good education in today's world requires much more than just solid academic instruction--it must also include a broader understanding of the application of those skills learned in the classroom. The Four Schools Project is an excellent example of this principle in action. I propose to my colleagues here in the Senate that this successful project is further proof that local educators will be able to make the best decisions about the unique needs of their students.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an appropriate time to bring my colleagues up to speed on the continuing saga that is the Microsoft anti-trust trial. Since I last came to the floor to discuss this issue, the industry, of which Microsoft is a part, has once again changed dramatically. For instance, American Online recently triggered the largest corporate merger in history with the acquisition of Time-Warner. This media giant is now poised to compete vigorously in every aspect of the Internet, from the wires that connect you, to the content you watch. To meet this challenge, Microsoft and a legion of its competitors must be allowed to compete vigorously in the ever-changing landscape of the information technology industry. 
   My fellow Senators will soon receive a ``dear colleague'' letter endorsing an amicus brief filed on behalf of Microsoft by the Association for Competitive Technology (ACT). ACT is a nonprofit association representing more than 9,000 companies in the information technology industry. ACT's membership is made up mostly of small and medium sized businesses but includes household names such as CompUSA, Excite at Home, Intel, Microsoft and Symantec. These members come from all walks of the industry, unified by the cause of protecting competition and innovation in the industry. 
   This brief was prepared by a bi-partisan group of legal heavyweights including former White House Counsels Lloyd Cutler and C. Boyden Gray as well as former Attorneys General Griffin Bell and Nicholas Katzenbach. It eloquently reinforces many of the points that I have made on the Senate floor for over a year now. In the end, I think you will agree that this document reveals the glaring weaknesses in the DoJ's case against Microsoft. 
   The amicus brief reinforces the point that current antitrust laws expressly allow, and even encourage, the kind of competitive activity that the government seeks to stop; the kind of competition that continues to benefit not only consumers, but the hundreds of thousands of high-tech workers and entrepreneurs in the software and hardware industries as well. It also sounds the familiar refrain that the government needs to take a highly pragmatic and cautious approach to antitrust enforcement in this dynamic industry. 
   Unfortunately, Judge Jackson found last year that Microsoft's Windows holds a lawfully acquired monopoly of the market for ``operating systems'' for Intel-compatible personal computers. Although Microsoft may later challenge this finding, the brief assumes for purposes of argument that the finding is correct. 
   The plaintiffs (the federal government and several states) charge that Microsoft, in adding the Internet Explorer browser to Windows and marketing the package, violated antitrust laws. The amicus brief--and the Supreme Court cases on which it relies--demonstrates that the purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect consumers and competition--not competitors--and that Microsoft, far from violating the antitrust laws, competed vigorously to the immense benefit of consumers. 
   Vigorous competition, which antitrust laws are designed to protect, produces innovation, better products, more efficient distribution, and lower prices. All of these results of competition are to the benefit of consumers. The antitrust laws do not require competing firms to be nice to one another, or protect firms against their more powerful rivals. It is not wrong for any company to want to take business away from its rivals. 
   The antitrust laws encourage a firm that holds a lawfully acquired monopoly to compete hard to keep that monopoly. They also encourage such a firm to enter other fields where, by competing with better and cheaper products, it can benefit consumers. 
   Judge Jackson found that the widespread use of the Windows operating system has made it is a platform for a vast range of computer applications that consumers now enjoy. 
   Judge Jackson also found that when Microsoft added a superior Internet browser (Internet Explorer) and offered it to consumers at no extra charge, these actions gave consumers better access to the Internet and spurred its rival Netscape to improve the quality of its ``Navigator'' browser and to distribute it at no charge. 
   Microsoft did not drive Netscape's Navigator out of the browser market. On the contrary, even Judge Jackson found that Netscape's ``installed base'' has more than doubled since 1995 and will continue to grow in the future. Browser competition remains vigorous. 
   Microsoft did successfully break into the browser market and did obtain a share of that market for itself. The single most important reason, as even Judge 
   Jackson found, is that Microsoft rival AOL itself chose and re-chose Internet Explorer over Navigator, even though AOL now owns Netscape. AOL made that choice because Microsoft offered a better product, better service, and better marketing support than did Netscape. 
   Microsoft's agreements with PC manufacturers and Internet access providers to distribute Internet Explorer were lawful agreements designed to help Microsoft break into a browser market in which Netscape was the overwhelmingly dominant firm. It was good for competition and consumers, for Microsoft to introduce competition into that market. 
   The plaintiff's theory is essentially that Microsoft, once it had a lawful monopoly in the operating systems market, should not have aggressively entered the browser market, because Netscape's dominance of that market might have led to more competition in operating systems. That theory is bad law. Again, the law protects consumers, not competitors. Consumers benefit when any firm, including one holding a lawful monopoly, competes aggressively to challenge another firm's incipient monopoly in a related field. 
   This competition helped usher in the most important change occurring on earth today. The power of information has been taken from a few large centralized institutions and put directly into the hands of people in every town and village across our globe via the Internet. 
   Not only is the number of users increasing exponentially, but the amount of information available to them is also growing at an unprecedented rate. The International Data Corporation estimated the number of web pages on the World Wide Web at 829 million at the end of 1998, and projects that the number will be 7.7 billion by 2002. 
   The explosive growth of the Internet will eventually have a fundamental impact on every aspect of American life, and will introduce a vastly different landscape in high-technology than exists today. Users will not necessarily  use stationary personal computers to access information, but instead rely on Web phones, palmtop computers and similar technology that is developing at an exponential rate. Microsoft must be allowed to compete in order to survive this transition. 
   Although Microsoft is a large and powerful company, it faces aggressive present and future competition in every field it enters, and if it wants to maintain its present position it must compete vigorously on every front, with innovations, improved quality and lower prices. That is exactly what antitrust policy seeks to promote. 
   For a court to enter into this vitally important and rapidly changing field and seek to dictate what products shall be made and sold by which firms would be a tragic mistake. For example, if a few years ago a court had ordered Microsoft not to add Internet Explorer to Windows, there would today be fewer hardware manufacturers, fewer software developers, fewer applications, and a far less developed Internet, and the world would be a poorer place. 
   The best solution for both the administration and the courts is to retire from the field and to allow the most dynamic company in the history of technology to continue its growth in a competitive market, free from government interference.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, welcomed to the chair in which the Acting President now sits the Vice President of the United States in his capacity as President of the Senate. It was out of order for me to speak at that point, and I regret the fact that I was unable to do so because my message is to the Vice President of the United States. 
   Leaving this place, he is now on his way to Seattle, my home State, in pursuance of the Democratic nomination for the Presidency. On a number of occasions during the course of the last year when the Vice President has graced us with his presence, I have asked on this floor and elsewhere that he address some of the controversial and burning issues in the Pacific Northwest, usually without getting a particularly significant response. 
   I don't intend to do that today. I welcome the Vice President to Seattle, and I am going to ask him for his help and for a favor to the people of that city and the region. 
   Early last year, the Clinton administration picked Seattle out of 40 city applicants to host a conference by the World Trade Organization for an extended period of time. Careful preparations for that meeting were made by the administration, by State officials, by officials in the city of Seattle and in the surrounding area, and by private organizations that desired to take part in the WTO meetings. 
   We, as is customary when a major international conference goes to an American city, recognized the extra costs that would accrue to Seattle and the region by directing the State Department to reimburse Seattle and surrounding communities by upwards of $5 million for the extra costs of law enforcement that were inevitably to be a part of that WTO conference. Senator MURRAY, my colleague, and I joined in strongly supporting that proposal, and it was accepted, not only by the Senate but by the Congress, memorialized in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. 
   As we all know now, to our regret, the preparations for that WTO meeting were inadequate to meet the deluge of demonstrators who descended on Seattle, some of them quite violent in nature. While in my view our law enforcement officers performed in exemplary fashion under extremely difficult circumstances, neither the political preparation for that meeting on the part of their superiors, the disposition of the law enforcement officers, nor their leadership was up to the task. We ended up with a very regrettable and probably disastrous experience in the city with security for the organization, added to, very significantly, for the future of our trade relations by what I consider to be the utterly inappropriate performance of the President of the United States in undercutting his own negotiators. 
   Nevertheless, the net result was approximately a cost of $12 million to law enforcement over and above what would normally have been the circumstances. Not only does that exceed by a margin of more than 2 to 1 the $5 million that we directed be added as assistance for those efforts, but the State Department of the United States of America has flatly refused to reimburse Seattle or any of the other communities in the area by so much as $1. 
   I may say, the State Department seems quite happy to reimburse the costs of all of the Members of both Houses of 
   Congress who went to Seattle for that conference, but a direction from this Congress, a direction from this Senate, that the Seattle area deserved a $5 million contribution to these law enforcement problems has, to this point, been utterly ignored by the State Department. Seattle and other local officials have been spurned in all of their efforts to get that assistance by what I consider to be weak and inadequate grounds.

   Mr. GORTON. I asked in the letter that the Vice President, in his exalted position in this administration, do his very best to see to it that the State Department ends this arbitrary action and promptly reimburses the region with that entire $5 million figure, to be distributed as is most just among the various agencies that incurred those  costs. This is a simple request. It is a request to the Vice President of the United States to see to it that the United States keeps its obligations, obligations which to this point have been disgracefully ignored. 
   I am certain the Vice President has sufficient authority and importance in the administration that his views on this case, if they are made known forcibly and well, will be acted upon. I hope very much he will do exactly that and help us, at least for a modest degree of compensation for what was an extremely unhappy experience in the community as a whole and among our law enforcement officials.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the coming weeks, one of the topics we will no doubt address is this issue of school safety. 
   I want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of a group of students and teachers in eastern Washington in addressing violent crime in their community and making their school a safer place for all students. The Leadership Class at Naches Valley High School has done an excellent job at incorporating creative solutions and programs to curb gang activity and encourage fellow students to do well in school. For their efforts, I am presenting these students and their teacher, Mr. Sanford Jetton with my ``Innovation in Education'' award. 
   Naches Valley is a rural school district at the foot of the eastern side of the Cascade Mountains. For years, Naches Valley High School reflected the small community values with little conflict between students. In 1996, it discovered it was not immune from the problems that are common-place in most large urban schools--gangs, drugs, depression, crime, to name a few. 
   When the high school had its first incident of gang violence, students in the Leadership class were both frightened and angry. While such a reaction would be expected, their response was anything but typical. Not only did the students confront the gang members, challenging them to be positive contributors to the school atmosphere, but they proactively worked with their principal, their Leadership teacher Sanford Jetton, the Mayor, and the deputies from the sheriff's department to address the problem. 
   The students helped write a town ordinance which declared the local park to be part of the school grounds for an hour before and an hour after school, or whenever that park is being used for school activities. This allows for disruptive students to be dealt with both by law enforcement and the school's own ``zero tolerance'' gang policy. 
   As a result of this direct intervention, most of the gang members relinquished that affiliation and eventually graduated from Naches. In addition, there have been no further incidences of gang violence at Naches Valley High School since 1996. 
   The Leadership class did not stop with the problem of gang violence. Its members looked for innovative ways to promote drug and violence prevention through school and community service. The list of student-initiated accomplishments is quite impressive: 
   The class established a Student Accountability Board (S.A.B.) which provides alternative consequences for students pulled over by the sheriff's office for traffic violations. The S.A.B. has resulted in a 50 percent reduction in traffic citations. Seat belt use among students has also risen from 63 percent in 1997 to 93 percent in 1999. 
   Working with the University of Washington, the class prepared a suicide awareness program which has since spread to six other schools. 
   The class initiated a ``Student Sharing Solutions'' program which teams up schools throughout the Yakima Valley for such events as a countrywide graffiti paint-out.  
   The class has also taken the lead in such projects as replenishing local food banks and in raising money for a fellow NVHS student who was severely injured in a car crash and whose family has no medical insurance. 
   These young leaders, and their teacher have been recognized in their community at problem solvers and generous servants. In 1998, the Naches Valley Leadership Class received the Greater Yakima Chamber of Commerce Service Award. 
   As the Senate prepares to take on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I believe we in Congress would do well to trust students and teachers, like Sanford Jetton and his Leadership class with more freedom and flexibility to create these types of innovative programs. 
   That is why I have introduced my Straight A's education bill to give parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members with the flexibility to make the best decisions about how to educate our children and provide measures to keep states accountable for the results.

I would have done so in spite of my high approval of most of the tax extenders and of many of the work initiative provisions. Nevertheless, the bill included an unwise and ill-considered new tax credit for the use of chicken waste for power production. That provision could never have survived standing alone.

Therefore, I believe that the grant should be made available only to a refinery that meets the Small Business Administration's definition of small; that is, less than 75,000 barrels per day capacity of petroleum-based inputs and less than 1,500 employees.

   Mr. GORTON. It has to do with the nature of the technology itself. As the Senator may know, diesel engine manufacturers currently are in the process of developing new technologies with the potential to radically reduce harmful diesel emissions, but which will require fuel with very low sulfur content in order to work effectively. To reduce the environmental impact of diesel emissions, the EPA is considering new regulations which would require significant reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel. 
   Large-scale, fully-integrated refineries are capable of cost-effectively producing low-sulfur diesel fuel using the traditional technology for removing sulfur from gasoline and diesel fuel, called hydrodesulfurization, or HDS. However, small refineries do not have that capability. HDS is a highly complex, energy intensive, and expensive process. As a result, it is not well-suited to small refineries, which generally are much more simply configured and produce a smaller variety and quantity of refined products than large refineries, and therefore cannot justify the expense of building and operating HDS units. 
   BDS, on the other hand, is a simple, efficient, and low cost technology which uses much less energy than the traditional HDS technology. A BDS unit is likely to cost 50% less to construct and operate than a traditional HDS unit. For these reasons, BDS technology is particularly well-suited to small refineries and holds great promise as a cost-effective alternative for producing low-sulfur diesel fuel. Because small refineries will be the principal users of the BDS technology if it works like we hope it will, it makes sense to first try it out at a small refinery. Therefore, we believe that the grant for a demonstration project should be directed to a small refinery.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. Additionally, I also understand that the day before this ``deal'' was announced, Judge Dwyer held a status conference with all the parties, including the defendant-interveners. The government attorneys told him that no agreement had been reached, and that the next mediation session was to occur on December 2. The Judge then set December 3 for the next status conference. Apparently, this Administration has as much trouble speaking with any probity to the Judicial Branch as they have recently with the Congress. It appears that the Judge's admonition to include the ``defendant-interveners'' in the discussions was ignored.

   Mr. GORTON. I concur with the observations of my colleague from Idaho. The sales in question have not been made available to operate. They are still subject to the impossible survey requirements that caused the injunction to begin with. That is why I would urge the Administration in the strongest terms to return to the negotiating table with the defendant-interveners and address their concerns. 
   Specifically, there should be an agreed-upon time-frame and a date certain for the completion of the agreed-upon survey requirements. Failure to conduct a good-faith effort to complete the settlement process in the fashion ordered by the Judge should be grounds for withholding final approval of the agreement.

I would also like to point out that the Interior subcommittee has questioned this initiative previously.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like briefly to address Section 2002 of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, which is an amendment to the Omnibus package, to clarify its meaning with my colleague who drafted the provision. 
   There are a number of United States companies that have applied to the FCC for licenses to operate non-geostationary satellite systems in the so-called ``Ku-band.'' These firms are spending substantial amounts of private capital to develop satellite systems that will provide a host of telecommunications services to benefit the public. The satellite systems that have applied for licenses in the Ku-band are designed to operate globally on a primary basis, and already are treated as primary users of the Ku-band in the International Table of Frequency Allocations. 
   Mr. President, I bring this up because section 2002(a) directs the FCC to consider issuing licenses, possibly in the same bands, for new terrestrial communications services that provide local television to rural areas. Section 2002(b)(2) provides that the FCC must ensure that any new licensees for local television in rural areas do not cause harmful interference to primary users of the spectrum, presumably the Ku-band spectrum. 
   I want to clarify that Section 2002(b)(2) requires the FCC to prevent harmful interference not only with those who have been designated as primary users on the date of enactment of this Act, but also with prospective primary users of the Ku-band. If the FCC were to misinterpret this section, that is, if the FCC prevented only harmful interference with those who are primary users on the date of enactment, the public could be denied the substantial benefits of emerging satellite technologies.

   Mr. GORTON. I am pleased that the Senate will pass the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act before the end of this session. Each year 250,000 Americans suffer from sudden cardiac arrest. It can claim the life of a promising young athlete, a friend of family member regardless of age or health. Sudden Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart's electrical impulses become chaotic causing the heart to stop pumping blood. Tragically, 95% of Americans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrest will die. 
   This bill helps to fight this killer by asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop public access to defibrillation programs for federal buildings. Public access to defibrillation programs include improving access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), training those likely to use the devices, ensuring proper medical oversight of the program and maintaining the devices according to manufacturer's guidelines. An AED is a small, laptop-sized device that is easy to use and can alalyze the heart rhythms of cardiac arrest victims to determine if a shock is warranted and, if necessary, deliver a life-saving shock to the heart. The devices are so important because for every minute that passes before a cardiac arrest victim's heart is returned to normal rhythm, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. 
   This bill also provides important gap-filling Good Samaritan immunity for the few states that have yet to pass AED access laws. It will help ensure that people who respond to an emergency and use an AED to help cardiac arrest victims needn't fear frivolous lawsuits. It also provides reassurance to nonmedical facilities such as adult day care centers, the first aid station in a shopping mall, casinos, fitness clubs, sports stadiums, a health clinic in a business, an airport, ambulance, firetruck or other locations where AEDs may be beneficial that they can make these lifesaving devices available. 
   I want to thank Senators JEFFORDS and FRIST for their help in moving this bill forward. I am also grateful to the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross and the thirty-three other health organizations that have worked so hard to ensure passage of this bill. This is a good bill, it will help save lives and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure that it is signed into law.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation of Ronald Gould to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Since 1975, Ron has practiced law at the Seattle law firm of Perkins Coie, specializing in commercial litigation, and the numerous letters of support and recommendation that I have received throughout this long process attest to the high regard in which he is held by the legal community in Washington state. 
   Ron's admirable professional and academic record, however, while alone enough to qualify him for the federal bench, is only a small part of what will make him an asset to the Ninth Circuit. While distinguishing himself professionally, Ron has actively participated in volunteer legal, civic, and community organizations and projects too numerous to recite in full. 
   In addition to being a former President of the Washington State Bar Association, Ron Gould has served on the historical societies for the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, has co-chaired, with Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire, a project to develop mediation in high schools, and has been a member of Washington Women Lawyers, and the Washington Association of Lawyers with Disabilities. 
   Among the many non-legal, civic organizations in which Ron has been involved is the Boyscouts of America, for which Ron has served on the Executive Board of the Chief Seattle Council since 1984. 
   Ron's legal and life experience has been extraordinary. So extraordinary that I am pleased to vote to confirm him to one of the positions of highest honor and responsibility in this country.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it was recently reported that Department of Justice anti-trust chief Joel Klein attended a party to celebrate James Glassman's new book ``Dow 36,000.'' During the party, Mr. Klein, who is prohibited from buying and selling stocks while he serves in his current post, was overheard saying to the author, ``Wow. Dow 36,000--I hope it'll wait until I get out of office.'' Mr. Glassman reportedly responded that Mr. Klein was already doing his part to keep the Dow down. 
   Mr. President, I am here to report that not even Joel Klein and the Department of Justice can shake the confidence of investors all across this great land who responded to Judge Jackson's Findings of Fact with a mild yawn. Apparently, investors understand that punishing trail blazing companies that have brought dramatic and positive change to consumers never has been, and never should be, the American way. 
   Despite the Government's attempts to turn the public against Microsoft, Microsoft continues to be one of the most respected companies in America. A majority of Americans believe Microsoft is right and the Government is wrong in this current lawsuit. In fact, a Gallup poll conducted over the weekend suggested that 67 percent of Americans still have a positive view of Microsoft despite the efforts of the Federal Government. 
   Judge Jackson made clear early in the case that he shared the administration's desire to punish Microsoft for being too successful. His Findings of Fact do not remotely reflect the phenomenal competition and innovation that is taking place in the high-tech industry every day. Reading the Findings, it is clear that even this judge could not document tangible consumer harm. Judge Jackson's thesis is that Microsoft is a tough competitor and that that toughness must stifle innovation and must harm consumers. But the judge could document no tangible harm *.*.* and this is why he will be reversed. 
   When you look at the world around us, whether in the workplace, at home, in schools, you see first-hand how 25 years of innovation in the high-tech industry has empowered and enriched people from all walks of life. 
   Every family and every community in America has benefited from the information revolution fueled by Microsoft. Sitting on the desktop in every office, school and hospital is a machine that brings power directly to people. Ten years ago only governments and large institutions had the power that so much information and knowledge brings. Today, because of competition among software and Internet businesses, that power runs to people and to families in cities and towns everywhere. 
   While the trial was going on, the high-tech industry has changed dramatically and reinvented itself a dozen times. Competition is alive and well and consumers are reaping the benefits. 
   Do the following numbers sound like they come from an industry that is stifled by monopolistic practices? 
   In 1990, there were 24,000 software companies. Today there are 57,000. And this growth shows signs of accelerating even further. 
   The high-tech industry accounts for 8.4 percent of America's GNP and one-third of our economic growth. 
   This year, the software industry alone will add almost $20 billion in exports to America's balance of trade. 
   It is particularly amazing that Judge Jackson found that barriers to entry into the market are too high. Apparently Linus Torvalds didn't get that memo. The 21-year-old student at the University of Helsinki recently disseminated into cyberspace the code for a computer operating system he had written. This experiment has evolved into the Linux operating system, which now has over 15 million users and is supported by such industry heavyweights as IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Compaq, and Sun Microsystems. 
   Also fascinating is the fact that the co-founder of Netscape, Marc Andreessen, created the technology for the Netscape web browser when he was a student at the University of Illinois. Four years later, the company he founded sold for $10 billion. Clearly, anyone with a great new idea can compete in this fast-paced competitive economy. 
   Although Microsoft is at the center of this fantastic growth that has helped 
   the economy and brought incredible technological advances to consumers, its position as a market leader is not secure. It remains true that anyone, from any background, can by hard work and determination, take on the most successful corporation of the 20th century. As the explosive growth of Linux shows, Microsoft, too, must be allowed to compete, or be relegated to the slow lane of the information superhighway. 
   The competitive environment in high-tech has never been stronger. Every day new alliances change the face of the industry. America Online has transformed itself into a web, software, and hardware dynamo by purchasing Netscape, forming an alliance with Sun Microsystems, and investing heavily in Gateway. It is competitors like this who are positioned to ensure that vigorous competition, which is a boon to consumers, will lead the way into the 21st century. 
   Should the Federal Government intervene, our entire economy will suffer. By picking winners and losers, stifling innovation and attempting to regulate through litigation, the Federal Government can do immeasurable harm to an industry it admits it doesn't even understand. Need I remind you that these are the same people who have brought you models of efficiency such as the IRS? 
   Regardless of the exponential growth and vigorous competition in the high-tech industry, Judge Jackson seems convinced that consumers have been harmed by Microsoft. This he believes despite the testimony of the government's own witness, MIT professor  Franklin Fisher, who when asked whether consumers have been harmed by Microsoft, responded, ``On balance, I'd think the answer is no.'' 
   Nevertheless, I was stunned when listening to Joel Klein proclaim that the Findings were great news for consumers. When is it good news for consumers to learn that the Federal Government is now running the high-tech industry? When Bill Gates, Scott McNealy (Sun CEO), or the head of a new high-tech start-up want to integrate new products or features into their software they will first have to get clearance from the de facto CEO of high tech, Joel Klein. 
   Speaking of the Associate Attorney General, if you were watching CNN last Friday evening without the volume on, you would have thought from the looks on their faces that Janet Reno and Joel Klein had just won the POWERBALL lottery or been given $10 million dollars by Ed McMahon. Mr. President, I repeat--this decision is not good news for consumers. The findings represent a terrible precedent, not only for Microsoft, but for high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, Austin, TX and the Dulles corridor in Virginia. The message is: if you get big, or too successful--you will be punished. The Department of Justice is keeping an eye on you--be careful or you may be next. The capital of the high-tech world isn't in Silicon Valley or Washington State, it's conveniently located within our Department of Justice on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   But, Mr. President, I have been a frequent critic of the Department of Justice's attacks against Microsoft and the high tech industry for a long time now. I will continue to ask questions--I will continue to defend the ability of high-tech companies that wish to compete without the threat of government intervention. I will continue to be deeply concerned about how the Department of Justice's action on Friday will jeopardize America's standing as a global leader in the field of technology. 
   The Department of Justice has now invited Microsoft's foreign competitors to use their governments to limit Microsoft's success. Joel Klein has just tilted the balance of power in favor of high tech companies abroad, in effect saying to Microsoft: Slow down and let the rest of the world catch up. 
   But I am sure many of these same questions and concerns will be raised by Microsoft's own employees next week when they host Vice President GORE on the Redmond campus. 
   To conclude, I repeat: This case should be dropped because antitrust laws exist to protect consumers--people who buy goods and services. Antitrust laws were not created to protect Microsoft's competitors, but that is what this Justice Department is doing. It is using the power of the Federal Government to punish Microsoft for being too successful in comparison to its competitors. 
   In the end, I believe, higher Federal courts will throw this case out. The truth and the correct legal analysis will prevail--Microsoft has not harmed consumers and, thus has not violated our antitrust laws.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two major debates are taking place in the Congress and in the White House at the present time, two major debates relating to education. 
   Tomorrow we are likely to take up an amendment to establish the Teacher Empowerment Act. And tomorrow we will almost certainly deal, finally, with the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, an appropriations bill that includes billions of dollars for public education in the United States of America. 
   There is a profound difference between the President of the United States and what I believe is a majority of the Members of both Houses of Congress over how that money on education should be spent. This morning's Washington Post summarizes that argument in quotations from our majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the President of the United States. 
   Senator LOTT said:  
   The big issue is, who controls it? Will Washington bureaucrats assert and control where this money is used, or will there be some discretion at the local level, based on what local needs are, whether it's books or computers or training for teachers, or for teachers themselves?  
   The President of the United States, according to the Washington Post:  
   ......told reporters that the federal money for new teachers does not belong to states and local school districts. ``It's not their money,'' he said.  
   What arrogance. The money does not belong to President Bill Clinton. This is money that comes out of the pockets of the American people across the United States, money they want to be used on the most effective possible education for their children. 
   The American people believe very firmly that decisions relating to the education of their children can be made more effectively and more sensitively at home by elected school board members, by superintendents, by principals, by teachers, and by parents than they can be by bureaucracies in the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or even by that national superintendent of public instruction, the President of the United States. 
   In fact, during the course of this debate over whether or not we should grant more authority to local school districts and to teachers and parents, a number of studies have come out on the question of whether the primary need in education in the United States is more teachers. 
   One of them comes from my own State from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee, the ``K-12 Finance and Student Performance Study.'' That study, just a little bit earlier this year, stated:  
   An analysis of 60 well-designed studies found that increased teacher education, teacher experience, and teacher salaries all had a greater impact on student test scores per dollar spent than did lowering the student-teacher ratio. According to one researcher, ``Teachers who know a lot about teaching and learning and who work in settings that allow them to know their students well are the critical elements of successful learning.'' Given limited funds to invest, this research suggests considering efforts to improve teacher access to high quality professional development. A recent national survey of teachers found that many do not feel well prepared to face future teaching challenges, including increasing technological changes and greater diversity in the classroom. 
   The legislature's approach to funding K-12 education is consistent with the JLARC [Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee] and national research. The legislature has provided additional funding for teacher salaries, staff development, and smaller classes, with more funding going to support teachers and less for reducing the student-teacher ratio.  
   In fact, the chart accompanying this study shows that increasing teacher salaries is 4 times more cost efficient than reducing class size, increasing teacher experience is 4.5 times more cost efficient than reducing class size, and increasing teacher education is 5.5 times more cost efficient than reducing class size. Given this information, it is clear that the President of the United States is putting politics ahead of academic achievement for our children. 
   There is another interesting statement on this subject written in April of this year by Andy Rotherham at the Progressive Policy Institute, an arm of the Democratic Leadership Council. He now, incidentally, works for the President. But he wrote in April:  
   ..... President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable and essential; however, mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs. 
   During the debate on the Clinton class-size proposal, it was correctly pointed out that research indicates that teacher quality is a more important variable in student achievement than class size. In fact, this crucial finding was even buried in the U.S. Department of Education's own literature on the issue.  
   Finally, another quite liberal organization, the Education Trust, agrees that we cannot afford to make schools hire unqualified teachers. Kati Haycock, executive director of the Education Trust, said yesterday:  
   The last thing American children need--especially low-income children--is more under-qualified teachers. If the White House hopes to ensure that the Class Size Reduction program will boost student achievement, it should accept the Congressional Republicans' proposal that would allow only fully qualified teachers to be hired with these funds. 
   Teacher quality matters, and it matters a lot. Highly qualified teachers can help all students make significant achievement gains, while ineffective teachers can do great  and lasting damage to students. The difference between an effective teacher and an ineffective teacher can be as much as a full grade level's worth of academic achievement in a single year. That--for many students--can make the difference between an assignment to the ``honors/college prep track'' and an assignment to the remedial track. And that assignment can be the difference between entry into a selective college and a lifetime at McDonald's. 
   Yes, small classes matter, but good teaching matters more. Our kids can have it all--smaller classes and better teachers. But first, the adults in Washington need to put aside the partisan bickering and remember what really matters--the best interests of American students.  
   This is exactly what we are trying to do. It is what we are trying to do in this last great appropriations bill: Saying yes, more teachers is a very important priority, but school districts ought to be able to decide that perhaps teacher training is even more important than that, or perhaps there is another higher education priority in their schools, in their communities, in their States. 
   Tomorrow, when we debate whether or not to add to this bill the Teacher Empowerment Act, we will be doing exactly the same thing, saying we in this body in Washington, DC, do not know all the answers, that there is not one answer for 17,000 school districts across the country; and we ought to trust the people who are spending their lives educating our children. 
   This is a vitally important debate, and one that the children can only win if we grant flexibility to those who are providing them with that education.

   Mr. GORTON. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy bill at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Under the previous order, there will be up to 4 hours of debate on the Hatch amendment No. 2771 regarding drugs, with a vote to follow the use or yielding back of that time. The votes on the nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun and Linda Morgan will be stacked to follow the vote on the drug amendment. Thus, Senators can expect three back-to-back votes between 12 noon and 1 p.m. tomorrow. There are a number of amendments pending on the bankruptcy bill, and it is hoped that they can be disposed of in a timely fashion, along with any other amendments Senators intend to offer to this legislation. The Senate may also be ready to take action on the remaining appropriations bills during tomorrow's session of the Senate. Senators should adjust their schedules for the possibility of votes throughout the day and into the evening. The leadership appreciates the patience and cooperation of his colleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process prior to Veterans Day.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during the past several weeks, a community in my state has come together to combat racism in their schools. One person, a student at Puyallup High School, has taken this problem head on and devised a way to bring his fellow students together in their fight against racism. 
   This student, David Poffenberger, an 18-year-old senior, designed a t-shirt that will be distributed to all of his 1,900 classmates in order to demonstrate Puyallup High School's united front against racism. 
   In one of his art classes, David created a design for the shirt--two silhouetted groups, one black and one white, united by a single handshake. David completed the shirt by adding the phrase, ``Bridge the Gap.'' With the encouragement from one of his art teachers, Candace Loring, David took a week off from swimming practice and visited with local community groups to turn his plan into reality. 
   The high school Booster Club, alumni association, the Puyallup Elks, and the Good Samaritan Hospital all contributed to his effort, raising over half of the $5,128 needed to print and distribute the shirts. The Booster Club has also agreed to cover the remaining amount in addition to their own $1,000 contribution. 
   David's principal, Wanda Berndston, credits him for single-handedly spearheading this effort to improve awareness throughout the school. In the midst of an unfortunate situation, it is often the individuals who are closest to the problem who can best offer solutions. 
   I commend David for his determination to make his school a better place for all students and am proud to present him with one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I expect the financial services modernization conference report will pass both the Senate and House with large majorities. I certainly understand the strong support for this sweeping legislation, though I must register my strong displeasure and firm opposition to the punitive unitary thrift charter provisions included in this measure. The language approved by the conference committee and favored by the Clinton-Gore administration unfairly, unnecessarily and without compelling reason eliminates and restricts existing authorities and powers of the unitary thrift charter. 
   I am proud to represent a state where the thrift industry is thriving. Washington state thrifts manage over $200 billion in assets. It may surprise some to learn that the largest unitary thrift in the nation, Washington Mutual, is headquartered in Washington state. One does not expect a financial institution of this size to be based in Washington. Though, knowing this fact, one should not be surprised to learn of my significant interest in how this legislation affects my largest financial institution constituent and a major Washington state employer.  
   I support virtually all of the conference report's modernization provisions: eliminating the 1933 barrier to the affiliation of banks, insurance companies and securities firms that will allow consumers greater choice at reduced costs; the compromise agreement reached between the Federal Reserve Board and Treasury Department on the regulation of operating subsidiaries; improving the Community Reinvestment Act; expending Federal Home Loan Bank provisions that will allow greater access for small business and farm loans; and the inclusion of privacy protections for consumers. 
   These provisions do contribute to the modernization of our nation's financial services industry from the Great Depression era laws under which they have been operating. These changes represent positive advances for the future. Such is not the case with the unitary thrift charter provisions. The unitary thrift language is regressive and punitive--a step backwards for financial modernization and a black-mark on an otherwise favorable bill. I sincerely regret that delusional fears about the non-existent and impossible mixing of banking and commerce under a unitary thrift charter have prevailed over fact and reason. Neither the FDIC or the primary regulator have identified any safety and soundness concerns during the three decade existence of unitary thrifts. Not one. 
   It is clear that this legislation unfairly treats Washington Mutual and other unitary thrifts, and for this specific reason I seriously considered voting against the conference report to protest the injustice of the unitary thrift provisions. After listening to and speaking with Chairman GRAMM to clarify the impact of the unitary thrift charter provisions, however, I concluded that I will support passage of the conference report. The unitary thrift provisions are completely contradictory to this legislation's goal of modernization, yet I find the clarifying statements of Chairman GRAMM to be of sufficient reassurance that I will not vote against this conference report.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to applaud the members and volunteers of the Mt. Baker Parent-Teacher Association that have successfully raised over $100,000 for its schools. Mt. Baker is a small, rural community just south of the Canadian border that lacks a sufficient tax-base to cover the costs of buying new technology for its schools. 
   In an effort to raise funds to purchase up-to-date resources for their students, volunteers from the PTA opened a small restaurant with their own time and resources. To date, this venture has provided over $100,000 to improve education in Mt. Baker. For that reason, I am pleased to present one of my Innovation in Education Awards to the Mt. Baker PTA. 
   In January of 1989, 20 parents took out a loan and purchased a run-down restaurant booth at the Northwest Washington Fair Grounds. Parents and volunteers spent countless hours cleaning and preparing the restaurant for its opening in March of 1989. For the past 10 years, volunteers and parents have worked at hundreds of community events to feed the fairground visitors, raising money that funded new research and learning equipment for math and science students, field trips across western Washington, and countless other tools for learning that have enhanced the education at all Mt. Baker schools. 
   The volunteers at the Mt. Baker PTA demonstrate that local educators and parents know what their students need to succeed and deserve the freedom and flexibility in the Federal education funds to better educate their children. 
   The innovative thinking and hard work of the Mt. Baker community teaches its students of the importance of a good education and how a community can work together to achieve a common goal. The Mt. Baker PTA is an example for all of us to follow. I hope that my colleagues will join me in commending the people of this community for their hard work to improve the education for their children.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on few occasions is this body faced with a bill that is supported by such a vast, diverse, and a broad based list of industries and organizations, such as the NAACP, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Council on Africa, and the National Retail Federation. The African Growth and Opportunity Act provides a real chance for the U.S. to engage in new trading partnerships with the sub-Sahara Africa, but also provides a mechanism to assist those countries to bolster their own economies. 
   This bill is important not only because of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, but for the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the Generalized System of Preferences Program (GSP), and the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs contained therein. It is essential that the Senate reauthorize the GSP and TAA and discontinue the practice of simply extending these programs year by year. This all encompassing trade package, the result of three years of negotiation, deserves passage. 
   What is also essential about this trade bill, is the manner in which the United States can give a hand-up to the Caribbean Basin and sub-Sahara Africa. After the death and destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch, the Caribbean nations have been struggling to regain the economic hold necessary not only to sustain their inhabitants, but to continue to prosper in the world economy. Instead of providing blanket financial assistance, the Caribbean Basin Initiative provides a mechanism and an avenue for these nations to begin rebuilding their economies. The tariff preferences provided in this bill, on products not previously covered by the 1990 CBI, will allow this region to expand economically, and integrate them into the international trading system. 
   In addition, these Caribbean nations have asked and desire similar treatment to those afforded Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement. These nations aspire to have the ability to broker trade deals with the United States in order to ensure their economic longevity in the region. 
   Trade with Africa is just as significant. According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa in 1998 was approximately $6.7 billion, or 1% of total U.S. exports. Conversely, the U.S. imported approximately $13.1 billion from sub-Saharan Africa. The African Growth and Opportunity Act establishes the protocol and trade mechanisms necessary to engage in future endeavors with these countries. The bill provides for benefits under the GSP for sub-Sahara Africa as well as benefits for the textile and apparel industries. As my colleagues know, these benefits were constructed not to inhibit, but to enhance these industries in the United States. All garments and apparel manufactured in Sub-Sahara Africa must consist of U.S. thread, yarn, and other components. 
   For my own State of Washington, passage of this bill means additional export markets for our highly sought after wheat, world-renowned aircraft, and the various other commodities and goods and services that has made Washington the most highly trade dependent state in the nation. For example, the leading exports to sub-Saharan Africa include aircraft, wheat, and aircraft parts. Incidentally, 68% of the aircraft utilized in sub-Saharan Africa is produced by the Boeing Company. Boeing estimates that these nations will eventually require at least 270 new aircraft valued at approximately $20 billion. Naturally, the 330 in the current fleet will require new parts and services. I cannot over emphasize the importance of these numbers alone, not only to Washington state, but to all the Boeing employees nationwide. 
   But free trade does not exist for the soul purpose of exports. Through the mechanisms and tariff reductions provided in the CBI, Northwest companies such as Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer have an opportunity to expand and import new materials and apparel. 
   Mr. President, again I reiterate the importance not only of the content of this trade bill, but of the far-reaching support for its passage. Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN have repeatedly reminded our colleagues of the many, many organizations and entities that support this bill. Religious leaders coupled with business, and agriculture working with the apparel industry--these partnerships emphasize the importance of expanding and enhancing free trade to sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this omnibus trade bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a landmark Labor, Education, and Health appropriations bill. It is a landmark in more than one respect. From my perspective, however, it is especially notable for two features relating to our assistance to the education that is being provided to children all across the United States of America. 
   The first is this bill, in reaction to the President's budget message of much earlier this year, ends any dispute about the generosity of support for education on the part of either the President or the congressional majority. In fact, this bill includes some $300 million more for education purposes than did the President's budget message earlier this year; $2 billion more than last year--$35 billion in total. 
   Mr. President, $35 billion is not an inconsiderable sum. But of that portion that goes to our common schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, it still will represent only about 7 percent of the number of dollars that go into providing an education for future generations of Americans. But there is not a dispute in this bill over whether or not we should fund education with this relative degree of generosity. In that respect, this is a landmark bill. 
   But as we deal with the question of education, I believe it to be a landmark in more than just that respect. This bill, in its present form, represents the first modest turn from a direction that we have taken for three decades or more. During the last 30 or 35 years, the Congress and Presidents of both parties have piled one categorical aid program for education on top of another. Each of those programs has its own rules for eligibility. Each has its own rules as to how money should be spent. Each carries with it its forms to be filled out and its audits to be performed and to be examined after the fact. 
   The President's proposed budget added a number of new categorical aid programs to those already in existence and, I believe, shortchanged a number of the most vital educational programs that have been a part of our system literally for decades. As a consequence, this bill provides considerably more money for impact schools than the President's budget called for. Impact schools, of course, are those schools on or near military reservations, Indian reservations, or other Federal property in which a peculiar and unique burden is placed by the fact that the Federal Government has employees or beneficiaries in the immediate vicinity while at the same time owning tax-exempt property that does not, as property, pay its fair share or any share of the cost of operating those schools. 
   Most national administrations, most Presidents of the United States, have not much liked impact aid. It took me some time to determine in my own mind why that was. I think it is because once the formula distributes so many dollars to a school district in impact aid, the school district decides how the money is going to be spent to advance the education of its students. There aren't any rules and regulations from the U.S. Department of Education telling school districts how they must use that impact aid. As a consequence, it has never had much of a lobby in the Department of Education or in administrations either Republican or Democratic. 
   A second area in which this bill includes more money for education than did the President's original request is for IDEA, the education for the disabled. This body proudly reauthorized IDEA just 2 years ago, including in it a provision that we would come up with 40 percent of the costs that that bill, for the education of the disabled, imposed on school districts all across the country--40 percent of those costs. This bill, more generous than the President's budget, actually funds about 9 percent of those costs. Members of the Congress and the President got to congratulate themselves on passing a bill mandating education for the disabled. They got to congratulate themselves on a promise that, very bluntly, I think, neither side had any intention of keeping. We do not, in this bill, come close to that 40-percent requirement, but we do better than the President of the United States did in his budget submission.  
   From my perspective, however, the most important change takes place in connection with a program that began last year designed to put more teachers in the classroom, especially more teachers in the classroom up through the third grade, a proposal that, for all practical purposes, could be used only for that purpose, whether more teachers in those primary grades was the primary need for each and every one of the 17,000 school districts in the United States or not. 
   I don't believe my State is different from many others. My great friend and frequent ally, the Senator from West Virginia, is on the floor. I suspect he has a greater percentage of school districts in his State than does Washington State that don't receive enough money under this program to hire one teacher because they are simply too small. So this bill, after an extended debate between the two sides in which one side said we have to continue the program entirely unchanged, whatever those school districts' priorities are, and our side that says we have to trust the school districts to spend that money for any educational purpose they desire--two rather dramatically opposed points of view--takes a halfway position between the two. 
   It states that the primary goal of this $1.2 billion is to put more teachers in the classroom but that if school districts have other priorities or if they don't get enough money to do that for even one teacher, they can, in fact, use it for improving the quality of teachers they already have through more training or for some other educational purpose they believe is more significant than the top-down mandate in this bill. 
   I hope that will be appealing to the President of the United States. It does express at least a qualified degree of trust on the part of the Congress in the dedication and intelligence and knowledge of the men and women who run our schools, either as elected members of school boards or as full-time superintendents, principals, and teachers, to make decisions that will improve the quality of education of their children. 
   I have never been quite certain why it is that Members of the Senate think they know more about the needs of schools all across the country than do the people who make their entire careers out of providing that education, but that has been the net result of what we have done. This is a modest move in the other direction, a reflection of the fact that early next year, when we debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will debate exactly that kind of issue: Who knows best what our young people need, we in Washington, DC, or those who run the hundreds of thousands of schools in the United States of America. 
   This bill also begins to keep a promise we made a relatively short time ago significantly to increase funding for health research through the National Institutes of Health. 
   This bill is a landmark in one other vitally important respect. As generous as this bill is to education, as generous as it is to health programs and to other programs included within it, it is a part of a pattern of 13 appropriations bills that spend almost $600 billion in discretionary money in the course of the next year but do not touch the Social Security trust fund. Last year, for the first time in decades, we ended up with a budget that was not only balanced but in surplus to the tune of $1 billion without touching a dime in the Social Security trust fund. We are absolutely convinced, I think most of us, that we should make the year 2000 the second consecutive year in which that takes place and keep on following exactly those same policies. 
   We can pass this bill and the other appropriations bills still unresolved without dipping into the Social Security surplus and without increasing taxes on the American people. That truly is a landmark. We thought when we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we might get to this point in 2002 or 2003. We got to it in fiscal year 1999. 
   This morning's newspapers printed excerpts of a speech by Alan Greenspan on the nature of our economy and on the fact that it has actually been growing more rapidly and is more robust than most of our statistics had indicated. Chairman Greenspan has made it very clear that actually balancing the budget and paying down the debt is a key factor in keeping the economy of this Nation moving forward. 
   We have a bill that I commend enthusiastically to all of the Members of this body. It is generous with education dollars, as it ought to be for one of the highest of all priorities in any society, the education of its future generation; it provides at least a modestly greater degree of trust in our professional educators and in our elected school board members with respect to how to spend that education money; it deals generously with our need for health research; and it is a part of a pattern that will continue the 1-year precedent of balancing the budget without invading the Social Security trust fund, without breaking the promises we have made not only to those who are retired today but those who are working today but will depend on Social Security in the future, 
   that the money they pay into Social Security is for that purpose and that purpose only. For that reason, I highly commend this bill to the Senate of the United States and hope it is passed and approved by the President of the United States.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, in introducing a bill to rationalize the federal management of spectrum that is used by entities for their internal wireless communication needs. The legislation does essentially three things. First, it recognizes that auctions are not an appropriate means of allocating spectrum for these private users, and so exempts from auction that spectrum that is used for private wireless applications. Second, it directs the FCC to reallocate an additional 12 megahertz of spectrum to private wireless users, who, over the years, and despite the efficiencies they have obtained through shared use, have lost spectrum and currently do not have enough to meet demands in some areas. Third, the legislation authorizes the FCC to collect lease fees for the use of the 12 MHZ to be reallocated. 
   One of the biggest challenges in preparing this bill, Mr. President, has been to define the class of beneficiaries, that is, to identify what is a ``private wireless'' system. The definition in the measure we are introducing today may not be perfect, and I look forward to working with all interested parties to ensure that the definition covers the appropriate class of users. The intent, however, and one that I believe is captured in the current definition, is that we recognize that there are thousands of corporations, utilities, farmers, and other entities, that use spectrum purely for their internal communication needs, with applications that range from reading utility meters from a distance, to operating sprinkler or irrigation systems, to communicating over hand-held radios in the middle of the woods, a factory floor, or a construction site. This use of the spectrum, Mr. President, is economically vital to our economy, as it enhances the productivity of all of these users and, in many cases, makes their operations possible. 
   A distinguishing characteristic of private wireless users, and a reason that we are proposing that they be treated differently than other spectrum users, is that the private wireless users' application of the spectrum is often specifically tailored to the needs of that user, that is, it is a unique application that is not offered by commercial wireless providers. 
   Currently, private wireless users are licensed on a site-by-site basis by the FCC. Their license applications are coordinated by spectrum managers who attempt to maximize the efficiency of the spectrum and eliminate mutually exclusive applications by requiring that the spectrum be shared by multiple users. In this way, hundreds of different users can and do operate their internal wireless communications systems within a given geographic area. When the users' needs change, as they frequently do, as companies open new production facilities, begin work at new construction sites, or extend their service area, the spectrum coordinators, (spectrum allowing), will propose a new sharing arrangement and obtain a new site-specific license for the user. 
   The geographic based auction concept that the FCC is currently proposing for some of the spectrum now being used by private wireless, makes little sense for these private users. Unlike a commercial wireless provider, whose service must be operational within the entirety of a broad geographical license area, an individual private wireless user may require use of the spectrum only at single site within the area proposed to be auctioned. Moreover, private wireless system users are not in the business of  providing communications services, and don't want to be--so it is not in their interest to acquire, through auction, exclusive rights to the use of spectrum in a large fixed geographic area, when they will use only a small fraction of it, their site 
   may change, and they lack both the expertise or the desire to rent out what they do not need. 
   Recognizing that auctions are ill-suited as a means of allocating spectrum to private wireless users, however, is not to say that the public should receive no compensation for the use of this public resource. Unfortunately, the desire to raise revenue from the sale of spectrum appears to have overtaken the need to ensure that spectrum is used efficiently and that current, economically valuable applications, are not disrupted by a rush to sell in order to raise revenue. The proposal in this measure to allow the Federal Communications Commission to collect lease fees for the use of private wireless spectrum is, I believe, a way to reintroducing some rationality into our spectrum management policies, while ensuring a return for the taxpayer. 
   The legislation we are introducing today, Mr. President, is not a final product. It stakes out, however, a very important claim, and that is the importance of the private wireless spectrum users to the smooth and efficient operation of our economy. I look forward to working with all interested parties to improve, and pass swiftly, this important measure.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a life lived richly is the phrase that comes to my mind as I think of John Chafee: A life lived richly, not of the material things of this world but in the magnificent service he provided from the time before he was old enough to vote until his dying day; a life lived richly in the love and honor and respect of those who knew him best, many of whom are Members of this Senate, but love and honor and respect that came from his fellow citizens of Rhode Island and from men and women all across the United States of America. 
   I knew John Chafee for only 18 years. The word ``only'' and the phrase ``18 years'' do not generally go together, but even that relatively extended period of 18 years was only a modest fraction of the life of service performed by John Chafee. As a U.S. Marine before his 21st birthday, and through many battles and two wars, as Governor of the State of Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and for almost 23 years as a Member of this body, John Chafee dedicated his life and his entire career to the people whom he represented in the State of Rhode Island and, beyond that, to the grand concept that is the United States of America. 
   Unlike my eloquent colleague from New York who just spoke, I only served on a committee of this body with John Chafee for a relatively short 2 years. But I do remember vividly the work of several years in his office here in the Capitol in what seemed at the beginning almost a forlorn hope to balance the budget of the United States and to put this Nation and its economy on the sound footing that has been so evident in our economic successes over the course of the last few years. 
   As was the case with his work on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, that effort was a bipartisan effort, with most of its time being spent with the cochairmanship of the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. BREAUX. It was not at first successful, but it was the immediate parent of the success that this body, the entire Congress, and the President of the United States had in 1997 with a result that was greater than the expectations of any of those who began that lonely struggle or who were in on its completion. It might accurately have been said that success would not have taken place as dramatically or as soon without the dedicated efforts of John Chafee. 
   On a lesser but still significant level because, of course, each one of us does represent a particular constituency, I can remember vividly the way in which John Chafee, a Senator from Rhode Island, would make requests of me in connection with each of the year's Interior appropriations bills I have managed, softly and diffidently, but with a persuasive manner and reasoning and a persistence that lasted until the conclusion itself--a conclusion that, if my memory serves me correctly, was always favorable to Rhode Island and to the specific requests John Chafee made, partly on the merits of the case and partly because of the respect and love I held for John Chafee, along with all of my colleagues. 
   He did love his small State. He cared deeply about its people and carried the burden and responsibility of representing them both lightly and well. John Chafee, not surprisingly for a former member of the U.S. Marines with many battles and much conflict under the flag of his country in his early life, was not afraid to be alone even in this body and even in contentious times when he believed, as he often did, that his position was the right one. Equally, he was not afraid to join with others to test his ideas against the ideas of others and to reach a conclusion that could command the respect and the votes of a majority of this body. 
   He was a highly successful Member of the Senate, and so we will miss him, even though, in a way, some can envy a man who, continuously from the age of 18 or 19 until his dying day, was permitted to serve his country in so many ways and in so vital a fashion. 
   Now we are constrained to bid him farewell. But he goes with our admiration, our respect, and our prayers.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude and my appreciation to the House of Representatives for an action it took last week, under the leadership of Congressman GOODLING, chairman of the House committee dealing with education. The House has now passed the Academic Achievement For All Act, or Straight A's, a concept and a crusade in which Mr. GOODLING and I have joined as sponsors in our respective Houses of Congress. It is so dramatic a reform, so dramatic an expression of understanding on the part of the majority of the Members of the House of Representatives, that those who provide educational services for our children--their teachers and principals and superintendents and elected school board members, not to mention their parents--ought to be empowered to use the money they receive from the Federal Government for that education in a way they deem best, given the circumstances of each child and of each of the 17,000 school districts in the United States. 
   That philosophy is very much at variance with the standard philosophy of Acts of Congress, which increasingly over the years have told our schools in detail what they must teach, how they must teach it, and how they must account for it if they are to receive a modest percentage of their budgets that Congress itself supplies to them. 
   In order to pass Straight A's through the House of Representatives, Mr. GOODLING and his supporters had to scale it back to a 10-State experiment. 
   Even at that level, I believe it will be a dramatic reform, not simply because it provides this trust in our local educators and parents and school board  members, but because it carries with it a requirement for accountability that is a real bottom line requirement; that is to say, in order to take advantage of Straight A's, a State must have a system of determining, through some type of examination or a test, whether or not it is actually improving the educational achievement of the children under its care. It is only results that count in Straight A's and not how you fill out the forms or what the auditors say you have done with the money. 
   I believe we in the Senate will take up Straight A's in that form, or in some similar form, sometime during the winter or very early spring of the year 2000 when we deal with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But I am delighted that we have made such progress already in the House of Representatives. 
   Simply to ratify some of my remarks, I want to share with my colleagues comments that we have received from across the country about this dramatic change in Federal education policy:  
   I am pleased to offer my support to the Academic Achievement for All Act. This proposal, if enacted into law, would serve to complement the Commonwealth of Virginia's nationally-acclaimed national education reforms.  
   Governor James Gilmore of Virginia.  
   A new relationship between the states and Washington, as reflected in Straight A's, can refocus federal policies and funds on increasing student achievement.  
   Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.  
   Straight A's would allow us to use federal funds to implement our goals while assuring taxpayers that every dollar spent on education is a dollar spent to boost children's learning.  
   Governor John Engler of Michigan.  
   I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. I'm a superintendent. And what GORTON is trying to do would be the best for our kids.  
   Superintendent Joseph Olchefske, Seattle public schools.  
   The Straight A's Act will allow those closest to the action to make decisions about education in their own local school district.  
   Robert Warnecke, Washington State Retired Teachers Association.  
   Senator GORTON's Straight A's proposals is well-conceived with great flexibility for states and districts. It would help to focus federal resources where they are most needed.  
   Janet Barry, Issaquah Superintendent and 1996 National Superintendent of the Year.  
   I look forward to the debate in the Senate on these changes with particular delight because the House of Representatives' majority has already said that this is the direction in which we ought to lead the country.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the 2000 presidential election has already captured the interest of the national media, and once again the media struggles to make sense of one of this nation's most complex and confusing practices--the presidential nomination system. It is a tenet in this country, the greatest democracy in the world, that all citizens have an equal voice in choosing who will be the nominees for the final race for President of the United States. If there is one thing that has remained constant in the American system, it is democratic participation in our electoral process--a basic creed that has guided us toward wider participation and more direct election of our leaders. Ironically, however, every four years we are witnesses to the fact that the current system by which this country chooses its presidential nominees is not only arbitrary, but in many ways incompatible with the notion of equal participation in the nominating process. 
   One of the most memorable political cartoons I have had the pleasure of reading was drawn during the 1996 election by the cartoonist for a local paper in my home state of Washington. This cartoon illustrates just how bizarre the current presidential primary process really is. The cartoon features Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton brainstorming at the Constitutional Convention. Ben Franklin turns to his colleagues in jest and rattles off an idea for the presidential election system. He reads from his sheet of paper,  
   The President shall be chosen from among those persons who can hone complex ideas into simplistic sound bites, defame the character of their opponents, hide their own blemishes from an intrusive swarming press corps and--get this--win the most votes from a tiny number of citizens in a remote corner of New England!  
   To which Alexander Hamilton replies,  
   Very droll Franklin, you're quite the comedian.  
   Mr. President, I agree with the cartoonist that what our Founding Fathers would have regarded as a ridiculous way to choose a president is now reality. It is no joke--this IS how our Presidential nominating system works. 
   For some time Members of Congress, party activists, the states, and academics have all advocated reform of the Presidential nominating system in this country. The flaws in our current system are obvious. The system is unstructured, confusing, and it gives small states that hold early primaries or caucuses a disproportionate amount of influence on the final outcome. The lack of uniformity and clear guidelines in the system creates a system whereby states compete for an early position in the nominating process in order to attract candidates and to have some kind of influence in the nominating process. Small to middle-sized states that select delegates later in the game risk being shut out of the process all together and face having a limited role in choosing the Presidential nominee. While the 2000 primary schedule has not yet been solidified, the first primary will be held at the earliest date in history, and an alarming number of states have moved or are considering moving their primary earlier in the year with the hope of influencing the nomination process. 
   Clearly, the system does not allow for equal participation by all the states. It undermines the ideal of equal participation in the electoral process by giving certain states, year after year, far more leverage than others. This unequal balance of power, if you will, compromises the integrity of the nominating process. 
   At this time, while this country's Presidential nominating system again begins to receive national attention, I believe it is fundamental that the American people and this Congress begin discussing methods to improve the current system and introduce reforms to encourage wider participation and more direct nomination of Presidential candidates. 
   I am introducing, today, a bill to provide for a rotating regional selection system for the nomination of candidates for Presidential elections. This bill will establish four regions comprised of 12-13 states from the same geographic area in the country. All states in a region will hold primaries or caucuses on the same date either the first Tuesday in March, April, May, or June and no region will vote in the same month. The order in which each region votes will rotate with each presidential election cycle, allowing each region to have the opportunity to be the first, second, third, and last region in the country to vote. 
   This bill introduces much needed uniformity and structure to a system that lacks real composition. It will eliminate the drive by the States to gain ``first-in-the-nation'' status and the ability for one or two small states to influence the entire nomination process. Under this plan each state will have equal opportunity to participate and influence the nomination process. This bill will also establish greater uniformity and structure by instituting much needed guidelines for states, delegate selection, and the role of Federal Election Commission. 
   Obviously, since we are well into the presidential nomination process for the 2000 Presidential race this bill, if enacted, will apply to 2004 and election years thereafter. 
   In summary, Mr. President, I look forward to discussing this proposal with my colleagues in the coming weeks and months. I believe it is imperative that we do everything we can  to improve the practice by which we nominate our country's leader.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this week, I had the pleasure of visiting twice with students, educators, and parents from the Edmonds School District. During that visit, I heard more about a community effort that demonstrates the value of local ideas and local innovation. The program is titled, Wake Up. Get Real. and is the product of Edmonds-Woodway High School students who are taking leadership roles in eliminating substance abuse and violence in their schools. 
   Some of those students are here this week in Washington, DC, and were able to join me on one of my regular radio shows where they shared their creative work with members of the media from across Washington State. While they are in town, I would like to take this opportunity to present them with one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards. 
   Wake Up. Get Real.'s strength lies in the grassroots, community-oriented nature of its effort, led by students, to reduce the violence and substance use that can tarnish a school's learning environment. The program is young, as it was only created this past spring, at the behest of students concerned about the perception of unsafe schools and an increasingly negative public perception of teens. 
   Rather than accept such a situation, the students embarked on a crusade that upholds respect, dignity, and integrity while teaching their peers that there are a vast number of students who choose not to participate in substance abuse or in violent activity. Additionally, the students are teaching educators about what is causing problems in their school and helping them to eliminate alcohol and drug use and violence in their classrooms. 
   All told, Wake Up. Get Real. generates increased community awareness; provides intervention and prevention from dangerous behavior at all grade levels (K-12); promotes increased educator focus on health as a factor in student learning; provides education materials for adults and students; and offers efficient access to referral resources. 
   For a program with such young roots, one would expect that it would still be in its infant stages. Rather, Wake Up. Get Real. already touts widespread community support from the school district, local health care providers, area law enforcement, and even the Drug Enforcement Administration. Community support has been so strong that public service announcements are currently being run on various cable channels to heighten local awareness of this important campaign. 
   When I began my Innovation in Education award program, my goal was to highlight the importance of local control in education. I couldn't ask for a better example than the students who lead Wake Up. Get Real. They have rallied the support of the community behind them and I commend them for their work in changing their schools for the better.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the conference report on the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The conference report represents a good faith effort to merge the spending priorities of the House, the Senate, and the administration, and to resolve the concerns voiced by the administration about various legislative provisions in the bill. I think the conference report is a solid, bipartisan bill that deserves the overwhelming support of the Senate and the signature of the President. 
   The bill totals roughly $14.5 billion in discretionary budget authority, which is a significant increase from the levels contained in the House and Senate passed bills. Some of this increase is attributable to the House and Senate insisting upon funding for specific programs, and much of the increase is due to the efforts of the conferees to meet the spending priorities of the administration. While the bill before you represents an increase of about $500 million over the fiscal year 1999 level, it is still $500 million below the administration's request level. 
   In developing the fiscal year 2000 Interior bill, the top priority for both the House and Senate committees was to maintain the core operating programs of the land management agencies, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and the cultural agencies funded in this bill. Because Interior bill agencies are highly personnel-intensive, simply keeping pace with the cost of Federal pay raises requires an increase of more than $300 million over the fiscal year 1999 level. This leaves little room from programmatic increases and new initiatives. 
   The conference report before you, however, does contain significant increases for targeted, high-priority programs. The bill provides roughly $28 million to increase the base operating budgets of more than 100 units of the National Park System, while also providing funds for a focused effort to enhance our limited understanding of the tremendous natural resources present within the Park System. The bill also includes an increase of $25 million for the operation and maintenance of the National Fish and Wildlife Refuge System, and increases for critical grazing management, road maintenance, wildlife and fisheries management, and recreation programs within the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. 
   For Indian programs, the bill provides the full administration request for the Office of the Special Trustee--the Secretary of the Interior's No. 1 priority within this bill. I fervently hope that these funds will enable the Secretary to clean up the Indian trust fund management mess that has been allowed to accumulate over many years. The conference agreement also provides an increase of $130 million for the Indian Health Service, and increases within the Bureau of Indian Affairs for law enforcement, school operations, school repairs, and school construction. 
   With regard to the cultural agencies in this bill, I am pleased that the conferees agreed to the Senate position with regard to the National Endowment for the Humanities, thereby providing a $5 million increase. I was disappointed that the House would not agree to a similar increase proposed by the Senate for the National Endowment for the Arts, but anticipate we will try again next year. I also note that the bill includes $19 million for the Smithsonian to complete the federal commitment to construction of the National Museum of the American Indian on The Mall, and $20 million to  continue renovations at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
   In addition to the programs I have mentioned, the conferees made a concerted effort to address some of the specific funding priorities voiced by the administration that were not included in either the House or Senate bill. The conference agreement includes $30 million for the Save America's Treasures Program for historic preservation, a grant program of particular importance to the First Lady funded for the first time last year. The conference agreement also provides funding for Federal land acquisition at levels higher than in either the House or Senate bill, including $40 million for the purchase of the Baca Ranch in New Mexico. 
   With regard to issues of policy, the conference agreement embodies a great number of compromises with both the House and the administration. The legislative provisions, or ``riders'' about which the administration has complained most vociferously have all been modified or scaled back significantly to address administration concerns. 
   The one year moratorium on oil valuation regulations contained in the Senate bill has been modified to provide a maximum of a 180-day delay while the Comptroller General reviews several aspects of the proposed regulations. 
   The provision in the Senate bill regarding millsites--which would have permanently refuted the Solicitor's opinion on this issue--has been limited to a 2-year provision that prohibits application of the new Solicitor's opinion to existing plans of operations, plans of operations filed prior to May 21, 1999, and patent applications that have been grandfathered under the terms of the Interior bill since fiscal year 1995. This provides some degree of fair treatment to those who have invested millions of dollars in the permitting process, only to find that the ground rules have been radically changed by the actions of a single bureaucrat. 
   With regard to grazing, the conference agreement includes a 1-year provision that is substantially similar to the provision signed into law as part of last year's bill. This provides for renewal of expired grazing permits pending completion of environmental review, but maintains completely the Secretary's right to renew, alter, or reject a renewal application upon completion of such review. The Senate bill included a permanent provision that was opposed by the administration. 
   The conference report embodies many more compromises such as those I have just described. I want to thank Chairman REGULA, his staff and the House conferees for their willingness to work through these many complex and difficult issues. I have thoroughly enjoyed my relationship with Chairman REGULA since becoming chairman myself, and admire his commitment to supporting, overseeing and, when needed, critiquing the important programs and agencies funded in this bill. 
   Finally Mr. President, I note that there are three corrections that need to be made to the conference report. The number for the Historic Preservation Fund in the National Part Service should be $75,212,000, the number for Forest Service land acquisition should be $79,575,000, and in section 310, ``1999'' should read ``2000.'' Mr. REGULA and I will take the necessary steps to ensure that thee corrections are made. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. It is a good bill that deserves our vote, and deserves the signature of the President.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will object to the request at least in the form in which it was presented. It seems to me there ought to be a right for anyone on this side of the aisle to speak first, after the conclusion of any speech on that side of the aisle. If the request is only for the order of speaking of Members of that side of the aisle, with the clear understanding that if a Member on this side of the aisle wishes to succeed one of them, that he or she may do so, then I will not object.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for all of the hours that have been spent on the debate on the particular bill that has been before the Senate, this year's form of McCain-Feingold, I believe it was summarized best, with the most striking degree of contrast to the paradox imaginable, last Friday by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD. He came to the floor of the Senate and specifically singled out the Microsoft Corporation, based, of course, in the State I represent, in an attempt to make a direct link between campaign contributions and/or contributions to political parties and the appearance of political corruption. In order not to misstate in any respect, I will quote briefly from the remarks of the Senator from Wisconsin:  
   Apparently Microsoft and their allies are not seeking to directly affect the litigation that is being conducted with regard to Microsoft by the Justice Department at this time; what they are trying to do, according to this article [an article in the newspapers on that day] is cut the overall funding for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. In this context, if somehow things don't look right, there is the ever present possibility that there would be an appearance of corruption.  
   The Senator from Wisconsin then went on to relate how he recently read that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is the world's wealthiest individual. This led the Senator from Wisconsin to say:  
   I have no idea what Microsoft's or Bill Gates' actual contributions are, and I am not suggesting that they are making those contributions to influence funding of the Justice Department. But for us to create a scenario where Mr. Gates could give unlimited amounts of money rather than the old $2,000 of hard money, or a Microsoft PAC could give more than $10,000, to just have it be unlimited I believe almost inherently ..... creates an appearance of corruption that is bad for Microsoft, bad for the Justice Department, and bad for the country.  
   It is 2 weeks ago that the General Accounting Office issued a report indicating the Department of Justice had spent, so far, $13 million in a lawsuit that it has brought against the Microsoft Corporation. Included in that $13 million is a considerable amount of money for public relations efforts on behalf of that lawsuit. 
   I think much of the speculation fueled by those public relations experts is that the Department of Justice, if it has the opportunity, may well ask the court literally to break up what has been the most successful single corporation, the single corporation most responsible for the dramatic change in the way our economy is run of any corporation in the United States. So we have an administration and a Government spending $13 million to prosecute a case against this corporation, speculating that it may ask for the breakup of the corporation. But for the CEO of that corporation to spend more than $2,000 in political contributions or for its political action committee to spend more than $10,000, that is an appearance of corruption which must be controlled by the Federal Government. 
   The bill the Senator from Wisconsin was promoting at the time he made this speech would say that corporation and that individual could not give $1, either to the Republican or the Democratic Party or to any of their subsidiary organizations, designed to be used for the education of voters or indirectly for the election of an administration more favorable to entrepreneurship in the United States. And this is denominated campaign election reform designed to deal with an appearance of corruption. Absolutely amazing--the Microsoft Corporation, not accused of doing anything wrong at all but simply because a Member of this body or the Department of Justice itself says there might be an appearance of corruption, should be deprived of any effective means of defending  itself in a political court of public opinion. The Government can spend $13 million or twice or three times $13 million engaged in the prosecution; the company cannot attempt to influence either the amount of money the taxpayers give to that Department of Justice or, more profoundly, the nature of the next administration that may or may not follow the same antitrust philosophy itself. 
   Now, I guess I can lay it out. I am the Senator from the State in which Microsoft is located. Close to 15,000 of my constituents are employed by that company. They have transformed not only my State and my constituency in a magnificently positive fashion but the entire United States of America and have had a tremendously positive impact not only on America's image in the world but on its economic success in the world. 
   You bet I defend them. You bet I hope in my next political campaign I will have its support. I already do, to a certain extent. That is totally public and above board. I would be totally remiss in my duties if I didn't do so. But to say, in a world with a Government that may be trying to destroy the company, that it is appropriate for this body to tell it that it effectively cannot participate in the political system or, for that matter, its employees can't effectively participate in preventing the Government from destroying their livelihoods in the corporation that they bring up is bizarre. Apparently, those who want to change the laws and ban political parties from raising so-called soft money say they do it to remove the appearance of corruption. But they will define what the appearance of corruption consists of so once anything that they dislike is described by them as an appearance of political corruption, all limitations are off. 
   They can do whatever they want. They can restrict first amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States in whatever way they would like to restrict them. The first amendment may permit, to an almost unlimited extent, pornography, but it doesn't guarantee the right of an individual or a group of individuals operating through a corporation to defend their livelihoods and their existence. 
   At the outset of this debate, the proponents were asked to come up with any incidents of actual corruption. In fact, they go out of their way to say there aren't any, or there aren't any that they know of, or there aren't any that they are willing to report. But they say: In our mind's eye, the present system creates an appearance of corruption; therefore, we can say to Microsoft, we can say to General Motors, we can say, for that matter--in theory, as they work through political parties--to liberal individuals or interest groups that you cannot contribute one dollar to the political party of your choice, to the political party you deem is most likely to allow you to conduct your business and your affairs in a profitable and constructive manner. 
   No attack on the first amendment rights of free speech could be more open or blatant than that. It says, simply, once we use those magic words ``appearance of corruption''--and we will define that phrase and we will define every activity that can be described by that phrase in our minds--we can then tell you that you are out of business; you can no longer participate, except with very modest contributions directly to candidates of hard money. And this philosophy isn't limited to the rather bizarre nature of the bill before us, which says that of the 5,000 to 7,000 registered organizations that say they want to participate in the political system through the use of soft money and so-called issue advertising, it prevents only six of them from doing so--three Republican formal organizations and three Democratic formal organizations. 
   This bizarre bill says it is perfectly all right to contribute this money to any of the other several thousand such organizations, but it is only the historic political parties in the United States, around which we have organized for almost our entire history, the activities and support of which somehow or another create an appearance of corruption. 
   Now, of course, the original McCain-Feingold bill did go beyond that and did say that no matter how seriously your most passionate interests as an individual or a group are attacked by the Government, or by a rival political organization during the last 60 days before an election, you could never mention the name of the candidate for office. Well, I think, for all practical purposes, we all know that proposition is simply blatantly unconstitutional. It flies in the face of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   But, this afternoon, at least for the more than 1 hour that I listened to speeches on this subject, the actual bill that is before us was almost not mentioned at all. All of the criticisms were aimed at the money chase through which candidates go, the demeaning nature of having to ask people directly for money to fund candidates' activities. But neither in McCain-Feingold 1 nor McCain-Feingold 2 is that subject dealt with at all. Not a word, not a line has anything to do with contributions to individual candidates. 
   ``McCain-Feingold lite'' has to do only with contributions to political parties for purposes other than the direct advocacy, 
   election, or defeat of a particular candidate. How that is supposed to corrupt the process is, for all practical purposes, unstated. There is not the slightest allegation that Members somehow do things that they would not otherwise do because someone has given their political party an amount of money that can't be used directly for their own election. 
   ``McCain-Feingold heavy'' is hardly a selfless effort on the part of any Member of this body because what ``McCain-Feingold heavy'' says is that your name, Mr. President, my name, and the names of all other Members can't even be mentioned in one of these ads for 60 days before an election. Boy, that is certainly comfort for the political class--take everyone out of the business for the last 2 months before an election of communicating their own ideas about candidates independently of a candidate himself or herself. 
   Now, we are also told that we didn't get enough time to debate this matter and that the debate wasn't broad enough. I was here when we came very close to a unanimous consent agreement for a week's worth of debate on this issue. The whole thrust of that set of negotiations was that we could start with whatever the Senators from Wisconsin and Arizona wished, but there would be lots of amendments--amendments from the Democratic side of the aisle, amendments from the Republican side of the aisle, and several votes on a wide range of ideas. 
   But what actually happened was, on the second day--I must say, over the objections of the Senator from Arizona, who sits right in front of me--the minority leader and the minority whip set up a situation under which nobody else's amendments except theirs could be brought up, until theirs were completely dealt with. 
   My friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, came down here with a proposal in which I joined that said, OK, let's have a little bit more balance; let's increase the amounts of hard money contributions that we like--almost, though not quite, back to the level they were in 1974, in real dollars. And then at the same time, we will impose soft money limitations of the same amounts in which we have hard money limitations. There are even a few Members on the other side of the aisle who thought that was an idea worthy of discussion. But we weren't allowed to discuss it. We weren't allowed to put that one up. They used their perfect parliamentary right to squeeze it down to their own proposals. And now they complain because their own proposals could not get a sufficient number of votes to bring them to any kind of final decision. 
   Now, in an ideal world, I don't think we should limit either of these kinds of contributions. I think we should make them all public and make them public promptly. But if we are going to do so, I can't see the slightest rationale in the world for saying that the limitation in certain forms of speech to six organizations across the United States of America is zero, while limitations on everyone else with that kind of money do not exist at all, and limitations on direct contributions of candidates are so low as a result of 25 years of inflation that anyone who truly wants to participate has to do it in a different division. 
   One of the primary reasons more money goes every year into so-called soft money contributions is the fact  that hard money contributions directed to candidates are increasingly limited simply by the passage of time and by inflation. But then, of course, there would be other forms of soft money that aren't even remotely covered by even the broad version of McCain-Feingold. That is the political advocacy of every major media in the United States--of newspaper, radio station, and television station. What is the value of those contributions on editorial pages across the country? Does the average citizen who is brought up having an interest in government have the same influence over the political process as the editorial director of the New York Times? Of course not. Does that individual have the same influence as the head of Common Cause or the National Rifle Association or the AFL-CIO? Of course not. Both latter organizations are at least membership organizations which sometimes to a certain extent reflect the views of their members. 
   The newspaper editorial writer reflects only the views of the newspaper owner or the newspaper publisher or the decisionmaker within that newspaper. Of course, those newspapers want to limit other people's voices. From their perspective, the first amendment is the total protection, from their view, and it is. But to exactly the extent they can limit the voices of others, their voices will be heard more loudly. And little is heard about the fact their voice is louder than that of the average citizen. But the first amendment does not say everyone has an equal voice in the public marketplace. It does say everyone has an equal vote in an election. But with respect to the marketplace and political ideas, it simply says Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of speech. And every member of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in 1974, when the last case came before it, said that freedom of speech to be effective does allow and require the use of money to make it carry further than any of our individual voices do on a windy day out of doors--every single one of them. 
   So the idea that somehow or other all voices have to be heard equally is not only not found in the Constitution, it is not found in any free society. To allow the Government to try to determine what voice each person sends is exactly a power James Madison and the draftsmen of the first amendment said they would not allow the Government to do. 
   Let me return to the point at which I started, which does at least have a virtue of dealing with the bill that is before us and not the lamentations of many of the Members on this floor that have nothing to do with the bill that is before us. 
   They are saying, in effect, in one instance named by the Senator from Wisconsin, that a company now being prosecuted by the Federal Government may not participate effectively in the political world out of which that prosecution grew, may not participate effectively in supporting candidates or a political party that will have a profoundly different view on antitrust laws. The Government can spend an unlimited amount of money. Editorials writers can write an unlimited number of editorials. But the very subject of that prosecution, the very subject of those editorials, cannot participate effectively in the political process that brought about the prosecution in the first place. 
   The very statement of that kind of limitation is an 
   argument--in my view an overwhelming argument--against this proposal at the present time. The marketplace of ideas is disorderly. The marketplace of ideas is open. The marketplace of ideas is often dominated by those who have the most ideas, the greatest stake in whether or not they carry. No citizen is limited in his or her participation. But each citizen can spend as much of his or her time and effort and money as he or she deems necessary at least to see to it those ideas are heard effectively by the people of the United States in a free country. 
   I deeply hope Microsoft and the employees who work for it in my State and elsewhere will have decided by this time next year that they need a new administration with a very different direction of the United States in order to keep providing for this country the kind of leadership they have provided. I am not sure I have persuaded them of that yet, but if I do, and if others do, they should not be artificially limited with the statement that freedom of speech is for someone else but, for all practical purposes, not for you when your very existence is threatened. 
   That is what this is all about. And I don't think views on the floor of the Senate--or at least the votes--are going to be changed by another week's worth of debate. 
   I am unhappy only with an alternative idea, somewhat more reasonable and somewhat more balanced, that the very tactics of the people who are now protesting the end of this debate prevent this presentation. 
   We will try at least to put it in play for the next time around. But for now, it seems to me appropriate to move on to another subject.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1997, Congress created the Mark-to-Market program, which was designed to preserve the affordability of low-income rental housing and reduce the long-term costs to the Federal government. The program is designed to restructure the mortgages for HUD insured properties so that they can be supported by market based rents. 
   Under the Mark-to-Market program, HUD enters into agreements with State and local housing finance agencies, as well as a limited number of private firms, called Participating Administrative Entities or PAEs. The PAEs underwrite and recommend the financial restructuring of these properties. Under the agreement, the PAEs determine rent levels, how much of a new mortgage the property can support with those rents, and how much of a second mortgage HUD will have to hold on the property in order to ensure that the restructuring is economically feasible. The program also allows the housing finance agencies to provide financing for the new first mortgage on the property, even though they have inside knowledge of how the agreement is negotiated and structured. 
   However, the legislation creating the program recognizes that a conflict of interest can exists where the housing finance agency that is charged with restructuring the mortgage provides financing for the same property. In this situation, HUD is to establish guidelines to prevent conflicts of interest. Despite this provision, the legislation before us today requires the Secretary to approve financing by a HFA under the risk sharing program where the financing meets certain terms and conditions. Under this language, it is possible that the housing finance agency can gain an unfair advantage over other lenders who want to compete to provide financing. This could happen if the housing agency has the opportunity to review all submissions for financing and structure its own proposal so that no other lender can compete. In addition, property owners will have virtually no voice in determining who provides a mortgage on their property if they wish to stay in the program. 
   It is the intent of this bill, in the interest of all parties, that all lenders be given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field in providing financing. To this end, HUD should exercise its authority under the conflict of interest requirement and undertake an independent review of the financing proposals. This could be accomplished, for example, by having the housing finance agency submit all lenders' proposed financing packages to HUD and include a statement justifying its position on the recommended financing. This independent review will allow the best financing alternative to be used for restructuring and will allow lenders to compete on a level playing field.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when is it okay for a gun to be at school? I find it hard to think of an instance when it is. In fact, a few years ago Congress was so concerned about guns at school that it passed a law that required school districts to implement a zero tolerance policy for guns or lose their Federal funding. Schools must expel a student who brings a gun to school for a year. 
   Three weeks ago a young man at Lakeside High School, a public school of 520 students in the Nine Mile Falls School District in eastern Washington, brought a handgun to school. Thankfully, school authorities were notified quickly and nobody was hurt. Students and parents were understandably upset that such an incident would happen at all, and assumed that the situation would be dealt with in accordance with the district's ``zero-tolerance'' policy for such matters.

   Mr. GORTON. To the best of my knowledge, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I am reading from a web site of the Senator from Arizona, which includes the sentence that says, and I quote, ``Pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited contributions from special interests.'' 
   In this particular list, entitled ``The List Goes On and On,'' the very first example is a $1.3 million earmark for the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle, WA. 
   Just what pork barrel spending is and just how that spending is a result of unlimited contributions from special interests is a matter that the Senator from Washington fails totally and completely to understand. 
   I say to the Senator from Kentucky that the appropriation was the result of a request made by the U.S. Trade Representative in what I believe is a Democratic administration to the two Senators from Washington for assistance in financing a governmental operation--a U.S. governmental operation--the U.S. Trade Representative's participation in that World Trade Organization meeting to be held in Seattle. 
   I ask the Senator from Kentucky, since the Senator from Arizona has refused to answer these questions of him,  or similar 
   questions from the Senator from Utah, how in the world can an appropriation to a unit of the U.S. Government to conduct trade negotiations be either pork barrel spending or the result of unlimited contributions from special interests? Can the Senator from Kentucky enlighten me on an answer to that question?

   Mr. GORTON. A second question: There is a second accusation on another portion of the web site: The part that ``This `Pork Delight' took the form of the 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Special interest unlimited campaign contributions were a key ingredient in the pork stew that is choking the American people.'' 
   One of those is, ``An exemption for the Crown Jewel mine in Washington State to deposit mining waste on additional land surrounding the mine, even though other mines were denied similar permission.'' 
   First, I ask the Senator from Kentucky, I don't see any appropriations or any use of the taxpayers' money in that connection. I have checked with the mining company in question that tells me they have never made a soft money contribution to any party or any group whatsoever. 
   I have letters from the county commissioners of the county in question praising this action--in fact, from a labor union that is usually not a supporter of the Senator from Washington on the same account--because this is one of the most poverty-stricken counties in the State of Washington, the Federal Government having closed almost all the timber harvests on public lands, other organizations having bought up other timberlands to prevent their harvest, and the administration being in the process of cutting off irrigation water to farmers. After 7 years of study and $80 million in complying with every single environmental law in the State of Washington, or for that matter the Federal Government, this company was denied its permit after a 100-year policy by a single bureaucrat. 
   I ask the Senator from Kentucky, in the absence of an answer from the Senator from Arizona, isn't this what we are supposed to do, represent our constituents? What soft money contribution could possibly have influenced this? One may certainly disagree with the policy.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Arizona said he wants to get back to the issues involved. I assume the Senator from Kentucky would agree with me that reasonable Members can differ on questions of high public policy, on the way in which we finance political campaigns, on how the Constitution of the United States with its unequivocal demand that Congress shall pass no law respecting the freedom of speech should be interpreted; that all of these are appropriate matters for debate, but that they are far better debated upon the merits, and, in general, accusations of a corrupt system, and rather specific examples pointed at individual Members without the slightest degree of proof, without evidence at all that they were related in any respect whatsoever to this matter--that these are separate questions but they are related questions when the proposition----

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we start from the most fundamental of all propositions, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. That amendment reads as it affects this debate, ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press''--``no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.''  
   The Supreme Court of the United States quite properly has determined that meaningful freedom of speech requires the expenditure of money and has been loathe to accept any restrictions upon the use of money to broadcast one's ideas about political propositions in the United States. 
   At least several speeches that I have heard during the course of the day--most notably earlier this afternoon by the junior Senator from California--quarreled with that fundamental proposition in the first amendment. About 30 of the Members of this body a year or so ago were courageous enough to vote for a constitutional amendment that would have limited first amendment rights. They were wrong, in my view, but they were highly principled to do so. Any meaningful limitation on political speech, in the view of this Senator, will require an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. GORTON. The quarrel of the general proponents of these ideas is with the Constitution of the United States and most expressly with the first amendment. The drafters of that amendment did not say that the Congress could attempt to equalize the rights of speech of each individual citizen of the United States. They simply said that political speech was open and could not be restricted in any way by the Congress of the United States. 
   If unlimited or, rather, if the right of some people to communicate more widely than others could be restricted, presumably we could treat as soft money the money spent by the New York Times to editorialize on this issue or that of a television network. Obviously, the editorial director of the New York Times has a stronger voice heard by more people than the average citizen. And so, of course, does a group or a corporation, for that matter, whose rights and money is at risk in debate here in Congress. 
   Those who feel at risk with respect to the policies that we adopt have an absolute right to speak out in that connection. It is a right that the proponents of this bill in general terms don't want to restrict. Few of them, however, have proposed constitutional amendments or limits on free speech in the arts or in literature or with respect to pornography. We are faced with the paradox in this debate that the proponents think the only kind of speech that ought to be limited is political speech, the kind of speech the first amendment drafters had in mind when they wrote the first amendment. 
   In a narrow phase of this bill as it appears before the Senate, the only evil organizations whose activities are to be controlled or whose contributions are to be not limited or banned of a certain kind are the two major political parties and their organizations. This bill at this time has no limitation on the contribution of soft money to other organizations that have political agendas. It cannot constitutionally limit issue advocacy. It can't even limit individual express advocacy as long as that advocacy is disclosed. 
   I suppose I find it most paradoxical the proposition that we base these controls on corruption or the appearance of corruption when the appearance of corruption is primarily created by those who want these limitations. Presumably, whenever they say that a particular act carries with it the appearance of corruption, that means it is the case and that the limits they propose on political speech are, therefore, valid. 
   That simply is not the case. Political controversy in the United States from the time of the first Congress in 1789 and the passage of the first amendment has often been disorderly; it has involved a number of outrageous charges as well as careful political thought; it has benefited those who want to put the greatest amount of time and money and effort and press into expressing their ideas. It has not been regulated by the Congress of the United States and somehow or another we have been successful. 
   The idea that cynicism or opting out of the political process is going to be improved by passing laws is a triumph of hope over experience. It hasn't happened in connection with any such law here or in any other State at any time in the past. We have gotten this far in the history of the United States with its most successful free government by prohibiting the control of political speech on the part of the Government of the United States. We will survive the next 200 years far better without any such prohibitions than if we grant them. 
   Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. That is our command. This is an attempt to cause such an abridgement.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during my service as a United States Senator representing the State of Washington, I have consistently reiterated one message to the growers and producers I represent. While I am not a farmer, and could not possibly pretend to understand the intricacies of the business, I will always do my best to understand farmers' needs and work on agriculture's behalf. But there is one message growers in the State of Washington have emphasized to me that I understand without question. When times are tough and the check book doesn't balance, families feel the pinch. 
   When times are tough, I have asked farmer after farmer, ``why do you do this?'' The job is terribly difficult, so much of what growers depend upon is unpredictable, and for two years in a row now, world markets have driven prices so low that fathers are telling their sons and daughters not to enter the family business. 
   But immediately after I question their dedication to their livelihood, I'm reminded of the golden, rolling wheat and barley fields of the Palouse. I remember my countless visits to Yakima and Wenatchee and seeing the lush, vibrant greens of the orchards, rising up out of the dust bowl that was once Central Washington. I think about the hearty breakfast I ate that morning and the apples and sandwiches packed away in my grandchildren's lunches. So much of what farmers do and what they produce is a part of our daily lives, that their existence in this country is paramount and deserves recognition. 
   Farmers are proud, tough, hardworking Americans. Apple growers in the State of Washington, for example, don't like to come to my office and ask for help. In the past few months, however, I have visited with many growers who are visibly despondent. Washington leads the nation in apple production, and over the past year, it's estimated that producers have lost at least $200 million in the fresh market. From Tonasket to Wapato, the message from orchardists was clear--we need help. 
   Over the past two months, I have communicated to my colleagues and others the significance of identifying a mechanism to assist fruit and vegetable growers in the disaster assistance package. During debate on the Senate floor in early August, I was able to assist in securing $50 million specifically for fruit and vegetable relief. In the conference report we're addressing today, potential relief for these very growers is incorporated in the $1.2 billion available for crop loss assistance. While I am frustrated that the specific designation for fruits and vegetables was removed, I am particularly pleased that apples were mentioned specifically. 
   Apples are not the only commodity produced in Washington that could stand to benefit from the crop loss section of the package. Asparagus growers, hard hit by weather and a lack of labor have lost thousands of dollars in fresh product. Potato growers who have also been impacted by poor growing conditions can approach the U.S. Department of Agriculture for assistance. Many are surprised to learn that the State of Washington produces more than 230 food, feed and seed crops, and I hope that many of these commodities will receive the assistance they require. 
   Wheat growers in Washington will also benefit from the $5.5 billion available for market loss in the disaster  package. The nearly $.60 cent per bushel payment to growers will most certainly ensure that the highly demanded soft white wheat our farmers produce will continue to flow to recovering Asian markets. 
   While the disaster package contained in the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill is most certainly the highlight of the legislation, there are other important, annual funding priorities included. As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to ensure that the research demanded and deserved as a result of the passage of the Farm Bill is provided for the Pacific Northwest. From research for hops to disease eradication in cherries, this bill provides funding necessary to ensure the longevity of the essential public-private investment in our nation's food production. 
   Language and funding in this bill directed at the implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act are also essential. Programs related to export enhancement and market development received the favorable attention growers in my state demanded. And the land grant universities are secure in knowing that the formula funds necessary for continued excellence in education are available. 
   With all that said, there are many in this body who know I was not pleased with the removal of Senator ASHCROFT's sanctions relief amendment in the conference report. Sanction relief is essential for the long-term prosperity of agriculture in America. While I received a commitment that the Senate would take up this issue before the adjournment of this session, I cannot over-emphasize the absolute importance and sincere necessity in addressing this issue. Food and medicine sanctions do not cripple regimes or dismantle communist governments. Instead, they hurt our family farmers and keep food out of the mouths of those who cannot provide for themselves. I initially refused to sign the conference report over this issue, and sincerely hope the Senate will address this matter in the very near future. 
   I am also not pleased with the manner in which this bill was dealt with in the waning hours of conference. Conferees were literally locked out of decisions related to the sanctions issue, dairy, and items included in the disaster package. This ``top-down'' philosophy is not what should drive the passage of appropriations bills. 
   All in all, Mr. President, what we have before us today is a good bill. Its contents include year-long negotiations on a variety of issues related to the essential functions administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While some issues have caused me to struggle with my support or opposition to the legislation, the benefits of its passage are overwhelming. It is my hope that the President will give his blessing to the bill so that our struggling farm economy can receive the charge it needs to rejuvenate our agriculture communities.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have followed the Senate's consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty with great interest, and am impressed particularly with the statement made last Thursday by Senator LUGAR--whose experience and knowledge on matters of foreign affairs and national security is highly respected by both Republicans and Democrats. I associate myself completely with his views. 
   I agree with Senator LUGAR that this treaty is unverifiable, jeopardizes our national security by eliminating our ability to modernize and increase the safety of our existing weapons, and will fail to achieve its principal goal: to provoke a roll call of countries that the simple phrase ``rogue nations'' conjures up in the minds of all Americans (North Korea, Iraq, and Iran, as well as China, Russia, India, and Pakistan) to refrain from engaging in nuclear testing. 
   First, I join Senator LUGAR in expressing my regret that the Senate is considering the treaty at this time. It has been my strong preference that consideration of the treaty take place after the election of the next President. President Clinton's record on this treaty has been one of political maneuvering and a legacy quest, with shockingly little attention dedicated to how this treaty serves our nation's  security and foreign policy objectives. But the timing of the debate and its duration are both the results of demands by the President and Senate Democratic leader. 
   My support for allowing a new President, should he or she support the treaty, to make his case to the Senate based upon its merits and that administration's broad foreign policy goals, however, does not mean I am not fully prepared to vote against the treaty if the vote takes place at this time. 
   Senator LUGAR presented a thoughtful and well-reasoned, though devastating, indictment of the treaty: the treaty will prevent the United States from ensuring the reliability, effectiveness and safety of our nation's nuclear deterrent, which means we will not be able to equip our existing weapons with the most modern safety and security measures available; the treaty is not verifiable--not only due to our simple technical inability effectively to monitor for tests, but due to the lack of agreement on what tests are permitted or not permitted under the treaty and the cumbersome, international bureaucracy that must be forged to conduct an inspection if tests are suspected; and, most importantly, that the treaty is unenforceable, lacking any effective means to respond to nations that violate the Treaty's conditions. As Senator LUGAR  stated, ``This Treaty simply has no teeth........The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the possible implementation of sanctions........For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could be brought to bear by the international community.'' 
   As I have already said, this debate is premature. It may well be that the passage of years and the development of our own technology might make ratification of the treaty advisable. It is not so today by a wide margin. I must, therefore, vote against ratification in the absence of an enforceable agreement to leave the issue to the next President.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the current political climate in our society is becoming increasingly disillusioned and thus less involved in public life and civil discourse. More than ever, we need public servants who combine vision, integrity, compassion, analytic rigor and practicality. As the first school of public affairs at a public university, the Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington has trained public servants and leaders in the Northwest for 37 years. The school's mission is motivating a new generation towards excellence in public and non-profit service and restoring the confidence, involvement and investment in public service. 
   Recently, the school was renamed for Daniel J. Evans, a longtime public servant for the people of Washington state who embodies the Graduate School of Public Affairs focus and values. As a governor, U.S. Senator and regent for the University of Washington, Dan Evans has stood for effective, responsible, balanced leadership. His public service legacy has touched so many citizens and has greatly impacted the state of Washington. Dan Evans' involvement in the Graduate School of Public Affairs will provide students the opportunity to learn from someone who represents effective, responsible and balanced leadership and who embodies the school's ideals. 
   The Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington has played a vital role in public policy and management and is now positioned to become the region's primary source of expertise and outreach on public issues. I have strongly endorsed these efforts and believe it is worthy of our support and investment.

   Mr. GORTON. My colleagues have been very clear as to their position on this issue. As a member of all three of the interested committees, Budget, Commerce, and Appropriations, I appreciate this issue from all the different perspectives. In short, I believe that we need to spend more on aviation infrastructure investment, but that increased investment should have to compete with other transportation and other discretionary spending priorities. I think the record shows that Senator SHELBY, Senator STEVENS, as well as the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Arizona are strong advocates for the importance of investing in airport and aviation infrastructure. I share their concern that firewalling or taking the aviation trust fund off-budget would allow FAA spending to be exempt for congressional budget control mechanisms, providing aviation accounts with a level of protection that is not warranted and I will not support such a proposition in conference.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we will take such measures as are necessary to see whether or not the objection can be withdrawn or we will simply go ahead and debate the substitute amendment. Let me add three other matters. 
   First, we will attempt to get a unanimous consent agreement on the filing of amendments as early and as promptly as we possibly can so debate can be carried forward. 
   Second, as Senator ROCKEFELLER pointed out, there are two additional amendments to this substitute amendment that can be put up whether or not the substitute amendment has been agreed to. One has to do with the air traffic control system and its modernization. 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER and I and many others, as the Senator from West Virginia pointed out, have worked diligently in that connection, and we believe that proposal now is not controversial, though it is of vital importance and we hope it can be agreed to promptly. 
   The other amendment, of course, is the amendment dealing with slots at the four or five busiest airports in the country. There may be some controversy in connection with that amendment. In any event, we hope that each of those amendments will be adopted relatively promptly. Members are urged to bring their amendments to the floor or to speak to the managers about concerns they have that may be solved relatively easily. 
   Under the statement made earlier today when this session of the Senate began, it is at least possible there will be further votes on this bill today after the vote on the Transportation appropriations bill at 5:30 p.m. In any event, there certainly will be by tomorrow. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I am going to explain this amendment in some detail, as it has been the subject of both long negotiations and much controversy internally in the Commerce Committee in the almost 7 months since the Commerce Committee bill was reported to the floor, and today. 
   I will say right now, for my friend and colleague from Illinois, after I have spoken on the amendment and Senator ROCKEFELLER has made any remarks on the amendment that he wishes, at the reasonable request of the Senator from Illinois, after any remarks he wishes to make, we will not take further action on this amendment today. The Senator from Illinois may have an amendment to this amendment. He may simply debate against and speak against the passage of this amendment. He prefers to do that tomorrow. At least informally, I will undertake that it will be the first subject taken up tomorrow. I am not certain I can give him absolute assurance of that, but I believe it should be the first subject taken up tomorrow, the debate to take place on it, and the positions of the Senator from Illinois presented. 
   There are other Members of the body who may also wish to amend this amendment. This amendment is central to this overall debate. Once we have completed action on this amendment, I suspect most of the other amendments to the bill will require much less time and will be much less controversial. 
   In any event, the background to the high density rule that is the central subject of this amendment is this: 
   In 1968, that is to say, 31 years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration established a regulation to address serious congestion and delay problems at five of the nation's airports. That regulation, known as the high density rule and implemented in 1969, governed the allocation of capacity at Chicago O'Hare, Washington National, and JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports in the New York City area. Newark was later exempted from the rule, so it now applies only to four airports. 
   The high density rule allocates capacity at the four airports by imposing limits on the number of operations (takeoffs or landings) during certain periods of the day. The authority to conduct a single operation during those periods is commonly referred to as a ``slot.'' 
   The Gorton/Rockfeller amendment consolidates all of the negotiated agreements to lift the high density rule, the slot rule, at Chicago O'Hare, LaGuardia, and JFK, and to ease the high density rule and the perimeter rule restrictions at Reagan National. 
   With respect to Chicago O'Hare, the amendment would eliminate the high density rule at O'Hare, effective April 1, 2003. 
   Regional jets and turboprops would be exempt from slot requirements effective January 1, 2000, for service to airports with fewer than 2 million annual enplanements. There are two additional conditions that would have to be met before carriers could take advantage of this interim regional jet/turboprop exemption. First, there could be no more than one carrier already providing nonstop service to that airport from O'Hare. Second, the exemption would only be available for new service in the market, such as when a carrier is adding a frequency to the applicable market, or upgrading the aircraft that provides its existing service in the market from a turboprop to a regional jet. 
   Regional jets would be defined as aircraft having between 30 and 50 seats.  
   Limited incumbent air carriers would also be exempt from the slot requirements at O'Hare, effective January 1, 2000. The terms ``new entrant'' and ``limited incumbent'' air carrier are often used interchangeably. Limited incumbent air carriers are currently defined as those carriers that hold or operate 12 or fewer slots at a high density airport. The Gorton/Rockefeller amendment would redefine limited incumbents as those carriers that hold or operate 20 or fewer slots at a high density airport. The limited incumbent would be exempt from the high density rule only if they were providing new service, or service that they were not already providing in a market 
   The Department of Transportation would be required to monitor the flights that are operated without slots under the exemption from the high density rule. If a carrier was operating a flight that did not meet the specified criteria, the Department of Transportation would be required to terminate the authority for that flight. 
   O'Hare is currently slot controlled from 6:45 a.m. to 9:15 p.m. The amendment would reduce the slot controlled window at O'Hare from 2:45 p.m. to 8:15 p.m., effective April 1, 2002. 
   International service to O'Hare would be exempt from the slot requirements beginning April 1, 2000, except or foreign carriers where reciprocal access to foreign airports for United States carriers is not available. 
   Carriers would be required to continue serving small hub and nonhub airports where the carrier ``provides air transportation of passengers ..... on or before the date of enactment'' of the bill using slot exemptions. This period of required service at O'Hare would last until March 31, 2007. 
   A carrier could get out from under these requirements if it could demonstrate to DOT that it is losing money on the route. 
   The amendment would terminate the high density rule at LaGuardia and JFK, effective calendar year 2007. 
   Regional jets would be eligible for slot exemptions for service to airports with fewer than two million annual enplanements. There are two additional conditions that would have to be met before carriers could get a regional jet slot exemption. First, there could be no more than one carrier already providing nonstop service to that airport from LaGuardia or JFK. Second, the exemption would only be available for new service in the market, such as when a carrier is adding a frequency to the applicable market, or upgrading the aircraft that provides its existing service in the market from a turbo-prop to a regional jet. 
   Regional jets would be defined as aircraft having between 30 and 50 seats. 
   Limited incumbent air carriers would also be eligible for slot exemptions at LaGuardia and JFK. Limited incumbent air carriers are currently defined as those carriers that hold or operate 12 or fewer slots at a high density airport. The Gorton/Rockefeller amendment would redefine limited incumbents as those carriers that hold or operate 20 or fewer slots at a high density airport. 
   The amendment would ease the current criteria that enable new entrant/limited incumbent air carriers to acquire slot exemptions. The Department of Transportation is currently authorized to grant these slot exemptions when to do so would be in the public interest, and when circumstances are exceptional. On most occasions, DOT has interpreted the ``exceptional circumstances'' criterion to mean that there is no nonstop service in the route proposed to be served. In other words, DOT would grant an exemption only when there is no service between the city proposed to be served and the high density airport. The amendment would eliminate the ``exceptional circumstances'' criterion. 
   The amendment would establish a 45-day turnaround for all slot exemption applications submitted to the Department of Transportation. If the Department does not act on the application within 45 days, it would be deemed to be approved and consequently the carrier could initiate the proposed service. 
   Carriers would be required to continue serving small hub and nonhub airports where the carrier ``provides air transportation of passengers * * * on or before the date of enactment'' of the bill using slot exemptions. This period of required service at LaGuardia and JFK would last until calendar year 2009. A carrier could get out from under these requirements it it could demonstrate to DOT that it is losing money on the route. 
   Next Reagan National. The amendment would establish 12 perimeter rule/slot exemptions for service beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter. To qualify for beyond-perimeter exemptions, the proposed service would have to provide domestic network benefits or increase competition by new entrant air carriers. 
   The amendment would establish 12 slot exemptions for service within the perimeter. Carriers could only apply to serve medium hubs or smaller airports from Reagan National. 
   The amendment would establish a 45-day turnaround for all slot exemption and perimeter rule exemption applications submitted to the Department of Transportation. If the Department does not act on the application within 45 days, it would be deemed to be approved and consequently the 
   carrier could initiate the proposed service. 
   On another subject, safety and delays, the Department of Transportation concluded in a 1995 report entitled, ``Report to the Congress: A Study of the High Density Rule'', that changing the high density rule will not affect air safety. According to DOT, today's sophisticated traffic management system limits demand to operationally safe levels through a variety of air traffic control programs and procedures that are implemented independently of the limits imposed by the high density rule. The Department report makes assurances that Air Traffic Control, ATC, will continue to apply these programs and procedures for ensuring safety regardless of what happens to the high density rule. 
   Many improvements have been made in infrastructure and air traffic management in the 30 years since the high density rule was first implemented, which should allow for additional operations without additional delays. 
   Improvements on the ground, including high speed runway turnouts, additional taxiways, and larger holding areas at the ends of the runways allow more efficient utilization of the gates and ground facilities and thus increase the capacity at high density airports. 
   Enroute, approach and departure air traffic management improvements have increased the air space capacity above high density airports. 
   In 1968 there were no ``flow control'' measures. Aircraft stacked up in the air rather than being planned and routed for arrival. Modern ATC flow control has significantly increased the airspace capacityu, while improving safety. 
   Greater precision radar has decreased aircraft spacing requirements, thus increasing capacity without sacrificing safety. Further improvements are expected with the existing Global Positioning System, GPS, Technology, allowing for additional capacity increases. 
   Future initiatives at Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia and JFK will permit growth without undue operational delays. 
   Airspace redesign, essentially the rethinking of the approach, departure and routing of aircraft, was proven effective in a recent pilot project a Dallas-Fort Worth. Redesign efforts are currently underway for the Chicago area and other airports. 
   Other FAA programs, such as RNAV (area navigation) and the National Route Program, already in use in some locations, will further enhance enroute and terminal capacity. 
   Technology improvements such as digital data transfer between controllers and pilots, automation tools for managing traffic flows, and precision location devices such as GPS will greatly increase capacity throughout the national airspace system. 
   The recent ATC problems were due in part to the unique combination of adverse weather and the introduction of new systems at key airports. The gradual phaseout of the high density rule will allow time to fix these problems, and for the growth in capacity to match the increased air traffic control capability. 
   The amendment allows 7 years before the slot rule is removed for the New York airports, and more than 3 years for Chicago. This phaseout allows adequate time for the FAA's initiatives to be in place. 
   Even if there is some increase in delays, in both Chicago and New York,  competitive nearby airports such as Midway and Islip provide a natural safety valve. 
   Many new entrant carriers operating point-to-point have found that using nearby secondary airports is a profitable way to offer service to major cities. If delays and the associated costs do increase in Chicago and New York's major airports, more operations will naturally move to these secondary airports. 
   Madam President, that is an explanation both of the details of this amendment and the rationale for the amendment. Again, in connection with the bill as a whole, this represents the level of partnership between Senator ROCKEFELLER and myself, but as broad consultation and as much agonizing discussion over the details as can possibly be imagined under circumstances on a subject so important.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, last Friday, I joined my friend and colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER, in introducing S. 1682. This measure is the culmination of input from a broad range of aviation interests. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I have been holding a series of meetings with industry representatives searching for input on how we can make a positive legislative impact on the current air traffic control system. 
   Three common themes emerged from these meetings: First, there will be a crisis in the aviation industry if we continue to experience the delays that plagued the system this summer. Second, the Federal Aviation Administration is doing a better job of responding to these problems under Administrator Garvey. The third point is, incremental changes are probably the best approach to take in reforming the system, as much as the Senator from West Virginia and I might very well prefer a more drastic reform. 
   The amendment we have just introduced is the text of that S. 1682. 
   Madam President, by now I am sure you have heard the analogy that fixing the air traffic control system is similar to trying to change a flat tire while traveling down the highway at 60 miles per hour. While I don't view the problem as being that daunting, I certainly think we can use a few good mechanics to help get the FAA back on the right track. I think the legislation Senator ROCKEFELLER and I have introduced is a step in the right direction. While I am in favor of an end result that goes much further, positive action is needed. At this time, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
   Our approach would attack the problem from the management side. It is no secret that the FAA has a history of problems controlling costs and schedules on large-scale projects. We hope the creation of the chief operating officer position, with responsibility for running and modernizing our air traffic control system, will inject the necessary discipline into that system. S. 1682, the current amendment, would also create a subcommittee of the Management Advisory Committee to oversee air traffic control services. Of course, in order for there to be a subcommittee of the MAC, we must first have an MAC. I am assured by the FAA that the Management Advisory Committee will be appointed soon. Let me assure you that this subcommittee chairman will not look favorably on any further delays on this question. 
   As we prepare to move into the 21st century, the NAS must be prepared to  meet the challenges of increasing demand on an already strained system. A blueprint for this system should be a top priority for the FAA. S. 1682, this amendment, authorizes $12 million a year for the FAA to develop a long-term plan to provide direction. The most radical portion of this bill and the amendment deal with an innovative financing pilot project. This provision would set up a mechanism to establish public-private joint ventures to purchase air traffic control equipment. Ten projects for ATC modernization equipment will be selected, $5 million per project, with a total cap of $500 million. FAA seed money would be leveraged, along with money and input from the airports and airlines, more quickly to purchase and field ATC modernization equipment. 
   As I stated earlier, this is not the final solution to our air traffic control system woes. We hope, however, that this will be the first step in a long journey to ensure Americans 
   continue to enjoy the safest, most efficient aviation system in the world. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment. 
   An oversight committee for air traffic control: The bill and the amendment provide the FAA Administrator with authority to create a subcommittee of the current Management Advisory Committee, a 15-member panel appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to oversee air traffic control services.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, we have now a unanimous consent agreement pursuant to which all amendments must be filed by 10 a.m. tomorrow. We appreciate the managers being apprised of those amendments to determine whether or not we can agree with some of them, unchanged or with modifications. We will probably go back to the fundamental amendment on slots to which the Senator from Illinois has objected and to which at least one Senator from Virginia, if not other Senators, have amendments to propose first thing tomorrow when we return to this bill. 
   If, however, there are amendments that can be agreed to relatively quickly, we may do that later on this evening after the votes at 5:30. 
   We will not debate either the Department of Transportation appropriations bill or nominations, so Members can come with amendments to this bill until 5:30 this afternoon. If they do, we will attempt to deal with them. If they don't, we will begin tomorrow. I know the leadership and certainly the managers of the bill want to finish this bill some time tomorrow. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the bill that is before us today, an appropriations bill for a wide range of subjects, including education, includes just four lines on this subject:  
   $1,200,000,000 shall be for teacher assistance to local educational agencies only if specifically authorized by subsequent legislation.  
   Now, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, described this money in this fashion because the chairman of the HELP Committee, the committee in charge of education in this body, has conducted a long series of detailed hearings on education in the United States toward the goal of renewing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Sometime next month or, at the latest, in January or February, the committee chaired by Senator JEFFORDS will report that Elementary and Secondary Education Act to the floor for debate. I will be surprised if the debate on renewing our most fundamental educational bill does not last at least a week. But it is simply because these issues are so vitally important and so key to the future of educational quality, so key to the achievement of our students, so key to their performance in a 21st century world, that it is not a debate that should be conducted on an appropriations bill in a 3-hour period. 
   I must, incidentally, say that this is 3 hours more than was devoted to the subject last year, when the first installment of this 100,000 teachers program was authorized. It was authorized as a part of that massive, overweight, end-of-session proposal that included at least half a dozen appropriations bills and hundreds of pages of authorizing language, the content of which most Members were entirely unaware when they voted on it. 
   The amendment of my colleague from the State of Washington is, at the very least, premature. She presents issues that are significant and important. They do deserve debate. I think there is a considerably better way. The way we wrote it last year created some overwhelmingly significant problems. It created, first and foremost, in the State of Washington, our own State--and I suspect in every other State in the United States--a situation in which a very large number of school districts got too little money to hire a single teacher. Slightly over 50 percent, slightly over half, 154 of the school districts in Washington State, didn't get enough money out of this program to hire one teacher, already distorting the priorities set forth in the bill. 
   Interestingly enough, I don't think this is a debate that ought to divide liberals from conservatives, much less those who believe in a Federal role in education from some, though I know of very few, who do not. 
   In the course of the last year, after the passage of that bill, I have been working with some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and with many on my own side of the aisle to come up with a set of ideas as to how we provide more trust in the people who have devoted their entire lives to education as teachers and principals and school board members and, for that matter, parents. We have heard from various of the academic organizations and think tanks, both on the liberal side of this spectrum and on the conservative side of the spectrum. 
   Interestingly enough, a paper was recently published on this field, authored by Andrew Rotherham of the then Public Policy Institute, a very liberal think tank. Here is what he said in the section of his paper on the subject of teacher quality, class size, and student achievement:  
   Now a part of Title VI of ESEA, President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable and essential. However, mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.  
   That describes perfectly the proposal before us right now: Washington, DC, knows best. This criticism was written by a scholar at a liberal think tank on education. But, interestingly enough, that scholar has now left the Public Policy Institute and works as President Clinton's Special Assistant for Education Policy today. His study is on our side of this issue, not on the side of this issue presented by the previous amendment. 
   I was disturbed by the way in which the bill came before us because essentially the bill says that if we don't pass authorizing legislation for this particular program, the schools lose the $1.2 billion. I believe, as does the committee that reported this bill, we should be providing our schools all across the United States with more means to provide quality education for their students. 
   So I really think in the debate over my amendment that at least we ought to secure a unanimous vote, whatever the views of Members on the amendment by my colleague from the State of Washington, because the amendment that is now before you, which I have offered, simply says that if Congress does not authorize this program by June 30 of next year, the schools will get the money anyway for any valid educational purpose, and they will get it in exactly the same dollar amount in every single school district in the country that they would have gotten had the Murray amendment passed and  had we authorized the program she proposes. 
   But what is the big difference? The big difference is that in the Murray amendment we are telling every one of 17,000 school districts in the United States that we know better than they do what they need in order to provide education for their students. Somehow or another, an immense ray of wisdom has descended on 100 Members of this body who know more about the needs of a rural district in North Carolina, more about the needs of New York City, more about the needs of 256, I believe it is, school districts in my own State, more than the men and women who have been elected school board members in each one of those school districts, more than the superintendents they have hired to run their schools, and more than the principals who preside over each of their schools or the teachers in those schools or the parents in those districts. 
   That is not a supportable proposition. That is not a supportable proposition. 
   Obviously, the needs of school districts vary from place to place across the country. Obviously, there are thousands of school districts that already have ideally low class sizes and have other urgent needs for the improvement of the performance of their students. 
   I am convinced that when we get to the debate over the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we are going to make profound changes in an act that has had wonderful goals for decades and has largely failed to meet those goals. I am convinced that one of the principal reasons those goals have not been met to anything like the extent we would wish is the fact that we are telling all of the school districts how to spend the money on literally hundreds of different programs. 
   I have a better idea, I am convinced, than even this 
   amendment I proposed here today--the idea that we allow States to take a large number of these Federal programs and spend the money as they deem fit, with just one condition, that one condition being that the quality of education be improved as shown by testing students by their actual performance. 
   Let me go back again to this critique by Mr. Rotherham: ``Illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense of results''--``means at the expense of results.'' 
   In one amendment here today, we are saying to every school district in the United States: Here is what you have to do with respect to the structure of your schools. We are telling them nothing about what they have to do from the point of view of the performance of their students. But when we get to the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will have that opportunity to go from a set of Federal programs for which the school district becomes eligible by filling out forms and meeting requirements set out here by the Congress of the United States or the U.S. Department of Education to one that says: Use your money to improve student performance, and if you do, if you keep on using it that way, you can keep on using it that way, but that is the only condition--provide a better education. 
   As an interim step, my proposal says if we don't agree on some of the proposals here, we are still going to trust you, Mr. and Mrs. member of the school district boards, and all of the professional educators, all of the men and women, the hundreds of thousands, millions of men and women in the United States who are dedicating their entire careers to education to being able to do the job. 
   Earlier this spring, when we came up with the proposition--that we passed last year without debating it--of a program that created a tremendous amount of awkwardness in half of our school districts because they couldn't hire a single teacher with the money, the associate executive director of the State school directors association in my State of Washington wrote this to us:  
   At some point elected officials in Washington, DC, simply must trust local education officials to do what is in the best interests of the kids in their community. We all have their best interests at heart.  
   Yesterday and this morning, all we heard from the other side of the aisle was that if we don't pass that previous amendment from my colleague, the 30,000 teachers who have been hired in the last year will all be fired and they will all be out on the street. We heard that from Member after Member on the other side. 
   If we do it my way, each of these schools districts will have the same number of dollars. Are they going to hire teachers with it? Do we have so little confidence in the ability of our schools to set their own priorities that 30,000 teachers will be out on the street? If we did, it would be because it was the unanimous opinion of school districts across the country that this wasn't the right way to spend money on improving education. 
   I expect that most of the money will continue to be spent on teachers--a very large amount. But it will be a little more in one district and a little less in another because each one of them will have different needs and different priorities. 
   No. Between these two ideas this is a great gulf. Each of us, I guess, has a strong ego, and humility is not a virtue widely practiced in the Congress of the United States. 
   However, it doesn't take a great deal of humility to say maybe the teachers in my State know more about education than I do; maybe our principals and superintendents know more about running their school districts than we do; maybe the elected school board members who run for just that office and are in the communities and are working with the parents know a little bit more about what their schools need in 17,000 different school districts across this country than do 100 Members of the Senate. 
   Members who vote for that other amendment will be saying: We know what's best; you don't. We know what's best. Do it our way. It's the only way to do it. 
   Those who take a different philosophical point of view will say: Let's provide our schools with the tools to do the job, but let's let them determine how to do the job. 
   Beyond that, my own amendment ought to unite us. We certainly ought to assure the money goes to the schools, and then when we have that week-long or 2-week-long debate this winter and decide how much Federal control we are going to impose, whether we are going to begin to provide more trust, the money will be there; it will be guaranteed to each of the school districts. But we don't need to do it here and now in a relatively brief debate. We do not need to say we know better than they do what their students need. 
   Guarantee the money for our schools through this amendment, guarantee our schools can set their priorities through their own professional educators, through their own parents, their own often amateur members of the school board, without our having to tell them how to spend every dollar. 
   I believe we should vote in favor of this amendment and against the other.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the beginning of his remarks, the Senator from Massachusetts said the Senator from Missouri, not having read the Murray amendment, made a factual error. I regret to say the Senator from Massachusetts, obviously, has not read my amendment when he stated it allows 15 percent to be used for administration and not go to teachers. In fact, the distribution formula under the Gorton amendment is identical to the distribution formula under the Murray amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is remarkable how a relatively short amendment and even debate can be misconstrued. 
   The amendment we have before us that will be voted on in about 30 minutes is less than 10 full lines long. Twice, the senior Senator from Massachusetts has said that it authorizes the States to take 15 percent of the money for administrative purposes, in spite of having been corrected after the first mistake. 
   In fact, in clear English, it states that the distribution will be for school districts in exactly the same form as would be the distribution under Senator MURRAY's amendment. I don't believe Senator MURRAY's amendment allows 15 percent to be taken out by the States for administrative expenses. Neither does mine. That is one point that has been made on the other side during the course of the debate. 
   Another--very recently by the junior Senator from New York, and by others--speaks of the tremendous waste and abuse in the use of this money for football teams and the like, which seems to be the inevitable consequence of trusting elected school board members to manage their own schools. 
   A few years ago when we began this debate I made a remark that I repeat now. How is it that voters who are so wise as to choose us to represent them in the Senate will be so foolish and so stupid as to choose school board members in their own communities who will take any money we give them and throw it away on frivolous, noneducational purposes if we allow them to run their own schools? 
   No one has answered that question. Yet this entire debate on the other side of the aisle has been taken up by Members who either implicitly or often explicitly, as is the case with New York, are willing to state that they know more not only about the schools in their own States but the schools in the other 49 States as well, and unless we tell every one of the 17,000 school districts in the United States of America precisely how to spend their money, they will waste that money. 
   More than 90 percent of the money spent on schools in the United States is spent by States and local school districts. Unless the proposition is that all of that money is wasted, that our whole system is so dysfunctional that we should abolish school districts, abolish elected school board members and simply run all of our schools from Washington, DC, unless that is the argument, the proposition on the other side arguing against my amendment simply falls by its own weight. 
   As I said earlier, I think the proposition proposed in the Murray amendment is clearly debatable. It wasn't debated last year. It was poked in a huge omnibus bill at the end of the session, unknown to most of the Members of both Houses of Congress. It has been debated for a total of 3 hours today. It needs to be debated against other competing ideas of at least equal and I think greater merit when we debate renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act sometime during the winter of next year. Perhaps by that time, with various ideas spread out, we can do a better job. 
   The Murray amendment, in order to breach one of our rules, has had to be written in an awkward fashion. It is an authorization but it is an indirect authorization. It deserves much more serious consideration than we are giving it this afternoon. It deserves debate against much more serious and broad ranging ideas. 
   It does seem to me, however Members vote on it--and Members who don't trust local school districts and think superintendents are incompetent, who believe that principals and teachers don't have the interests of the kids they are educating in mind, can certainly vote to tell them exactly how to spend this money by voting for the Murray amendment--even those Members ought to vote for my amendment because mine simply says if we don't adopt the Murray amendment or don't adopt something similar to the Murray amendment between now and the 30th of June of next year, the school districts will get the money in any event, and it is only in that ``any event'' they will be able to use it for any educational purpose they deem appropriate for the improvement of their students. If both amendments are defeated, the schools may forfeit the money entirely. 
   I trust Members on the other side will at least be objective enough to agree to the proposition that we ought to adopt my amendment unanimously and then determine whether or not this is the time, without any real debate, to say we have to have one more program added to the literally hundreds we already have on the statute books of the United States, all of which are for precise, single purposes, each of which implicitly or 
   explicitly says we don't trust our professional educators and our parents to know how to set the priorities for their own schools. 
   I firmly believe in the proposition we should provide that trust permanently through the amendment I offer. My amendment doesn't do that permanently; it only uses it as a backup. We will debate a more sophisticated version of it later this year or early next year. Between sides, there is a great gulf. That gulf is between those who believe people at home are professional educators, are elected school board members who do care about the kids they are teaching and do know what those kids need, and those who believe, unless we operate as a super school board, unless we adopt the assumption we know far more than they do about education, that education will not be provided.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment that I have before you and which will be voted on in a few minutes is extraordinarily simple both to understand and in its undertaking. It says that the $1.2 billion the chairman of the subcommittee and his ranking member have generously put in this bill, subject to the authorization of a specific teachers program, will nonetheless be available to the school districts of the country if we do not come up with a specific authorization of that very specific and prescriptive program, one, the merits of which as against trusting school districts, I find somewhat dubious. 
   It should be a slam-dunk vote for every Member of this body, and yet immediately after I last spoke on this issue, the senior Senator from Illinois said if we do not adopt the Murray amendment, 27,000, 29,000, 32,000 teachers who have been hired under the teachers program in the last year will all get pink slips. It is hard to think of a more bizarre argument. 
   Under my amendment, every school district will get every dollar it has gotten in the present year that is used to hire teachers. The only rationale for firing a single one of those teachers would be that the teacher was unneeded but that the school district had the money, could not use it for any other purpose because of the wisdom of the Members of the Congress of the United States and felt that there was an infinitely more important use for that money. 
   If that is the case, if thousands of teachers are going to be fired, it shows that the program was the wrong program in the first place and should never have been passed. 
   If the teachers program is justified, the teachers will stay on the payroll whether Senator MURRAY's amendment is adopted or not as long as my amendment is adopted. 
   They are on the horns of a dilemma: either they pass a foolish and unneeded program that would otherwise be rejected by every school district in the country, or they can reach their goals through my amendment, as well as through their own, and then debate at a later time under more thoughtful circumstances, as both the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont pointed out, the whole idea of how much direction we must impose on our school districts when we deal with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 2, 3, or 4 months from now. 
   But the fundamental difference between these two approaches is very simple. Their approach is: The people who run our schools don't know what they are doing and will waste money and will do it wrong unless we tell them, down to the last detail, how to set their own priorities. Their belief is that parents and teachers and principals and superintendents--those three sets of professionals who have devoted their entire lives to the education of our kids--and elected school board members, who go through campaigns, the way we do, because they care about their schools, do not really care or are too stupid to know what their students need and that one set of rules, applicable to New York City and the most rural district in South Carolina, is the only way we can provide appropriately for the education of our children. That is an argument that is not only perverse; it is false and erroneous on its face. 
   Let us admit that there may be people in the United States who know more about the education of their own children in their own communities than do 100 Senators. We should adopt the amendment that I have proposed. We should defeat the Murray amendment. 
   We should have the debate on a broader scale at a later, more appropriate time, not in connection with an appropriations bill that urgently needs to be passed by tomorrow so we can actually get this money to the schools so they can educate our children and do a better job in the future even than they have done in the past. 
   I guess I cannot yield back the remainder of our time. It is controlled by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to support the energy and water development appropriations conference report. Within this bill is funding for a critical effort that is essential to the long-term future for citizens of the Northwest: the cleanup and restoration of the Hanford site in the State of Washington. 
   The citizens near the Hanford area played a major role in the Nation's successful effort to win the cold war. Now it is the responsibility of our Federal Government to conduct environmental remediation so that the site will not threaten the health of future generations. This bill appears to fully fund the cleanup effort based on the priorities presented in the administration's February budget request. 
   One unresolved Hanford-related concern pertains to the Fast Flux Text Facility (FFTF). This is one of the world's premier research reactors, and last month the Secretary of Energy made the right decision to proceed with an Environment Impact Statement (EIS) on future missions for this facility. The FFTF holds the potential to create a sufficient and dependable source of medical isotopes used to cure cancer; it can also meet the needs of a variety of other missions, including the production of needed material for deep space missions. 
   In the administration's budget request, an inadequate amount of funding was requested for the FFTF. Subsequently the Secretary's decision to proceed with an EIS will require additional funds to complete this necessary analysis. I call on the Secretary to address this situation immediately so that the necessary reprogramming of  funds can be approved expeditiously, something he has not yet done. 
   This conference report also wisely deletes or fixes several provisions that were attacks on the Power Marketing Agencies generally and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) specifically. Report language asks BPA to report on fish and wildlife costs that will be incorporated within the upcoming BPA rate case. The timing of this request is awkward as it calls for a report prior to the end of the rate case; I request that BPA only make this report if it has no negative consequences on the rate case process. 
   Another area of concern pertains to the solar and renewable energy portion of this report. Due to budget restrictions, the amount of funding available for this program is less than ideal. Not only has this area of energy development seen recent dramatic breakthroughs in cost-effectiveness, it holds great promise for developing nations and emerging economies. My State of Washington is home to many of the Nation's leading solar and renewable energy companies and projects. I hope we will be able to give greater emphasis to this program next year. 
   On this subject, the conference report also references a specific appropriation to develop a materials center pertaining to photovoltaic energy systems. I hope the Department of Energy is aware that Washington State University has been leading an effort--along with 14 other top-tier universities and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory--specific to this area of research. DOE should proceed with these efforts in a competitive process, allowing the WSU-led consortium to remain under serious consideration for leading this area of research.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such of the Republican time to myself as I may use. And for the information of the Senator from Nevada, I believe I may be the last speaker on this side, and I have been instructed, unless someone else on this side comes to speak later, when I have finished, to yield back the remainder of our time, and we will vote then, which probably means a vote before 5:30.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday in this Chamber, I was engaged in what I believe was a debate on a fantasy. The minority party spent a great deal of time debating two resolutions on education, one proposed by their side and one proposed by our side, with the resolution proposed by their side based on the proposition that Republican appropriations bills were going to reduce the amount of money spent on education from last year by some 17 percent. 
   That resolution was long and detailed, and ``17-percent cut,'' ``17-percent reductions'' appeared all the way through it. 
   I say this was a fantasy debate because by the time the debate began, every member of the Appropriations Committee knew that not only was education not being reduced in the Republican proposal but it was being rather significantly increased, in fact, being increased by some $500 million more than the amount for education recommended by President Clinton in his budget at the beginning of this year. So there was the exercise of a process of beating a dead horse for at least an hour on the other side of the aisle before we voted on our respective proposals. 
   There was a significant second difference in that debate over education that was not a fantasy and was not beating a dead horse because the Democratic proposal was that we do more of the same thing that we have been doing the last 30 years with respect to our Federal involvement in education, without any particular or notable success, while we on our side were proposing not only that we focus more of our attention in dollars on education but that we begin to trust the parents and professional educators and principals and superintendents and elected school board members across the United States of America to make the decisions about the education of their children, which they have devoted their lives to doing, rather than making all of these decisions and saying that the same rules should apply to a rural district in North Carolina as apply to an urban district in Massachusetts. 
   That is a real debate. It is a debate which I suspect we will be engaged in tomorrow when we take up the appropriations bill for Labor-Health and Human Services, and it is a debate in which we will be engaged in, in an even more spirited fashion, when we come up to the renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   But in the course of the last hour, it seems to me, we have been engaged in another fantasy debate. The minority leader, and several of his members, have been on the floor making a number of statements that have very little relationship to the reality that is before us at the present time. They said, among other things, that they were cut out of the debate on a budget resolution. They were not. They voted against a budget resolution, not on the grounds of its spending policies but because they were vehemently opposed to any tax relief for the American people, tax relief which we desired to give to the American people. 
   At one level, we won that debate. We passed significant tax relief for a wide section of the tax-paying people. It has been vetoed by the President. So at that level, at least, they ultimately won. That money will come to the Treasury of the United States and will stay in the Treasury of the United States. 
   But they also said, now that they got their way, now that there was no 17-percent reduction in spending on education--always a fantasy--now that we are spending so much, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund. 
   I am here to say these appropriations bills do not eat into the Social Security surplus. They do, in fact, eat into some of the non-Social Security surplus, not only for the year 2000 but probably for the year 2001 as well. But they are within the estimates of those non-Social Security surpluses in the years in 
   which all of the moneys in these appropriations bills will, in fact, be spent. 
   That criticism, that we are raiding the Social Security trust fund, while it has no statistical validity, would at least have a certain degree of moral caution attached to it had we, during the course of the last several weeks, in debating appropriations bills, heard from a single Member of the other side that we were spending too much. But we did not hear that at all. 
   In fact, an hour or so ago, when the Appropriations Committee was approving this large bill for Labor and Education and Health, the only significant Democratic amendments were to spend more money, without any offsets whatsoever. So the cries that somehow or another we are breaking caps that that side did not want to break or that we are raiding the Social Security trust fund by spending too much money are in direct contradiction--as rhetoric--to the actions that, in fact, have taken place by the minority party, which consistently has said, if anything, not that we are spending too much money this year but that we are spending too little. 
   I have no doubt that within a few days the President of the United States, backed by many Members on that side, will say; yes, we need to spend even more money. If the President vetoes some of these bills, his veto will likely be based on the fact that we are not spending enough. And, in fact, he will ask us to increase taxes, having vetoed the opportunity to provide some tax relief for the American people. 
   Finally, we have heard complaints about the fact that we have not yet completed all of our work on appropriations bills. That is true; we have not. In fact, in the last 20 or 25 years, we have only done that on one occasion. If, however, within 2 days, we complete action on the 13th and last of these appropriations bills, at least the Senate will have passed its versions of all of these bills before the end of the fiscal year. 
   I had to manage one of those bills, one of the smaller of the bills, the one dealing with the Department of the Interior and other similar agencies. While it was spasmodic and interrupted by debate on other matters, we began the debate on that bill in the first week of August and ended it last week. Why did it take so long? Because one single amendment literally was filibustered by a Member on the other side of the aisle--unsuccessfully, as it turned out--delaying the passage of that bill by a good 2 weeks, and making it certain that--just physically--we cannot settle our differences with the House, modest though they are, in time to send such bill to the President of the United States by the day after tomorrow. 
   Nor has this Senator noticed that Members of the other party were not consulted or did not participate in the drafting of all of these appropriations bills. The overwhelming bulk of them in this body--perhaps not in the House of Representatives--were drafted in a collegial and bipartisan fashion by the Appropriations Committee and were supported by most of the members of both parties in almost every single instance. 
   Three or 4 hours ago, we passed a final conference report on the energy and water appropriations bill by a vote of 96 to 3. 
   Mr. President, does that sound like a partisan exercise in the deliberations in which one of the parties was excluded? 
   The Senate version of the Interior bill passed last week, if memory serves me correctly, by a vote of something like 87 to 10. I pride myself, as the chairman of that appropriations subcommittee, in consulting with members of both parties, listening to their  priorities, and meeting their priorities to the maximum possible extent. It was in no way a partisan exercise. Last Friday, a much larger and more controversial bill on the Veterans' Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development was passed by a voice vote. No one even bothered to ask for a rollcall because agreement on that bill was so widespread. 
   Yes, it is too bad we have to pass a 3-week continuing resolution at the present time. It is too bad there are differences between the House and the Senate. It is too bad there are such disagreements between the President and the Congress. That is the way we arrive, in a society such as this, at appropriate answers to all of these questions. It is a long way from being unprecedented. With any luck, this year, we won't have one agglomeration, one huge bill that no Member understands at the end of this process, but we will deal with 13 individual appropriations bills for determining the priorities of the United States. 
   Tomorrow, we will once again be engaged in a debate on education, among other subjects. I hope that debate will be more realistic than the debate that took place yesterday, that had no relationship to reality whatsoever, in connection with the basis for the Democratic resolution on the subject. 
   I hope it will be on a serious subject matter, not just of the amount of money we in the United States are going to devote to education--though that is vitally important, and this bill is quite generous in connection with it--but on the way in which that money ought to be spent. It ought to be spent in a way that increases the student performance of the children in the United States in our schools through grade 12 all the way across the board. 
   We ought to have the imagination to revise a system that has not been a notable success by any stretch of the imagination and go forward to a new system that looks not at forms to be filled out by school districts all across the country, not at the presumed wisdom of 100 Members of this body, many of whom seem to think they know more about education than the professionals who deal with it every day, but one that trusts in the genius of the American people and the dedication of the American educational establishment to make their own decisions in communities all across the United States of America about what may very well be the most important of all of our social functions--the education of the generation to come. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Washington Post printed an article last Sunday about a group of WWII veterans returning to the beaches of Normandy to share stories and remember fallen brothers. It was yet another reminder of the closing window of opportunity historians have to glean first-hand accounts from the generation of men and women who lived through the Great Depression, fought in WWII and came back to build America into the greatest power of health and wealth in the world. 
   The Washington Post wrote: ``World War II veterans are dying at a rate of more than 1,000 a day. `It's the equivalent to a library burning down every day,' said National Guard Maj. Gen. Gene Krase.'' 
   This week I'm presenting my Innovation in Education award to a group of students and educators in Wenatchee, Washington who are working to preserve the oral testimonies and first-hand accounts of the men and women who make up what some have called our greatest generation. 
   Allison Agnew's 11th grade Honors English class at Eastmont High School began the Honor By Listening program last year, which pairs each student with an elder in the Wenatchee valley to document his or her personal history. After the student recorded and transcribed oral testimonies, they wrote out each story in narrative form. 
   Businesses and leaders in the community support the process. Representatives from the North Central Washington Museum gave the students lessons on interviewing techniques and how to transcribe oral histories. Local librarians, attorneys, and business leaders joined educators to help the students edit their narratives. Materials and funds for publishing the final product came through donations from local businesses. It was a marvelous community effort. 
   Incidentally, one of my own staff members, Don Moos, has volunteered countless hours of his time to help connect students with potential interviewees. Don himself is a veteran who fought in the European theater during World War II. In fact, he won a Purple Heart in the Battle of the Bulge, but I have yet to hear his whole story though we have been friends for years. I look forward to reading about his experiences. 
   This year the junior class at Eastmont will continue the program. It already has obtained a list of 200 possible candidates to interview this fall. 
   I am proud of the efforts these students are putting forth to not only learn about, but to preserve, the rich heritage of Washington State. It is efforts like these that convince me I am heading in the right direction with my Straight A's bill. If we give educators the freedom and flexibility to meet the unique needs of their students, while providing them with a system of accountability for the results, we will see more innovative programs like this one. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his eloquent comments. I am honored to be a part of a partnership with him and with the distinguished Senator from Maine, who now occupies the chair, in proposing a set of reforms on the way in which the Federal Government relates to education in the United States that emphasizes student achievement and a higher quality of education, as against a number of categorical programs where school districts become eligible simply by filling out the right forms and spending the money in the way the Secretary of Education tells them to spend the money, without regard to student achievement and without regard to the priorities set by elected school board members and superintendents and principals and teachers and parents all across the United States. 
   This afternoon, we are going to vote on two distinctly different approaches to education--a proposal by the minority leader and a proposal by the majority leader. The proposal by the minority leader beats a dead horse. It starts from the proposition that we are to reduce the amount of money we spend on education by some 17 percent, when later on this afternoon--at 6 o'clock--the subcommittee in charge of appropriations for education, in fact, will pass an appropriations bill that not only increases the amount of money we spend on common school education in the United States but increases it by more than the amount requested by the President of the United States in his budget. That is a true commitment to education. 
   The Democratic proposal ignores the proposition that the President's budget, in fact, lessens the amount of money available for special needs students and education for the disabled; that it reduces very substantially the amount of money 
   for impact aid to those school districts that are greatly impacted by a Federal presence in national parks or forests or military installations; in fact, the proposal before us from the minority leader, ignoring the responsibilities the Federal Government has already undertaken in education, simply talks about new programs, the great advantage of which is that they are titled with names either of the President or of present members of the minority party. It does seem to me that even if we are working within the present system, we would be far better off financing those undertakings which the Congress and the President have already made than by beginning new ones, not particularly requested by the schools themselves, while leaving the financing of past programs to local entities, whether they regard them as the highest priority or not. 
   But there are, as I think the Senator from Arkansas pointed out, two major differences in the philosophy of education of the two parties exemplified by these two resolutions. First, as I have said, the resolution by the minority leader speaks about a proposal that does not, in fact, exist. It talks about the fact that education spending will be reduced when, in fact, it will be increased by more than the amount the President requests. 
   Now, the end of that resolution, of course, does say that we should spend more. Interestingly enough, however, it says we should spend more and take it out of other spending programs without breaking the so-called budget caps. That is an interesting proposition but one that would require genuine magic to accomplish. This body has already passed every appropriations bill, except that which includes education. It is on the basis of the passage of those bills that the minority leader comes up with this proposition that we will cut spending for education. I cannot remember a single member of the other party voting and speaking against a single one of these appropriations bills on the grounds that it spent too much money. 
   As a matter of fact, the great majority of them voted for each one of these bills that brings us into exactly this situation. Yet they state, with alarm, the fact that we would reduce this amount of spending, saying we should not do it; we should spend more money; we should not break the caps; we should take it out of something else--something they have already voted for. Well, we are, in fact, going to increase the amount of money we are spending on education. But we should do it--and this is the second great difference between the two resolutions--in a way that actually improves the quality of education of our young people, measures it in an objective fashion--actual student achievement. 
   The other side proposes not only more programs that have not dramatically had that impact, but they would like a half a dozen new ones in addition--all categorical aid programs--decided here in Washington D.C., all one-size-fits-all for every school district in the country. 
   The proposal of the Presiding Officer, myself, and others is a very simple one. We believe the people who spend their lives educating our children, and who have dedicated their lives to educating our children, might just possibly know more about what they need than do Members of this body or bureaucrats in the U.S. Department of Education. 
   We say, let's take 12, 21, or 24 of these present programs, and let any State which guarantees that it will use that money to improve student grade achievement do so for a period of 5 years and then be tested on one ground: Have students done better? Is the quality of the education they are getting improved by teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school board members who decide priorities? A rural district in Maine or an urban district in Washington or a suburban district in Pennsylvania will obviously have different priorities. 
   That is our goal, and it is a goal that is finding agreement in our educational establishment, wherever the Presiding Officer goes in her State, or wherever I go in my State, or wherever any of us go. Our schools want to be liberated because it is their goal to provide better educational opportunities for the kids. They think they know what the kids and students need. It is as simple as that. 
   We are fighting a phony battle today because, in fact, we are going to increase the amount of money available for education. But it will do us little good unless student achievement is increased and improved upon. We can only do that by changing the system and trusting those who have devoted their lives to educating our children with coming up with the right answers by which to do so.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the talents of my Staff Director, Bruce Evans, are exceeded only by his patience. 
   This bill has been on and off the floor for the better part of two months at this point and has now been passed by a fairly near unanimous vote as against the situation a year ago when we were barely able to begin debate on it. 
   Mr. Evans has led the staff of both parties with great skill and dedication and has kept me out of many troubles I might otherwise have had. Perhaps the best tribute to that is the fact that no changes were made in this bill in this 2-month period as a result of contested votes on the floor of the Senate. Many were made as a result of reasonable requests on the part of many of our Members. 
   I thank my ranking minority member, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, whose help and cooperation from the beginning of my chairmanship of this subcommittee has been unfailing and of immense effect. 
   Mr. President, I would once again like to thank both my staff and Senator BYRD's staff for all the hard work they have done on this bill. The Minority Clerk, Kurt Dodd, has been a pleasure to work with in his first full year with the Committee. He has proven to be a valuable resource for my staff through both his knowledge of the programs in this bill and his advocacy on behalf of members on the other side of the aisle. Kurt has been ably assisted by Carole Geagley of the minority staff, and by Liz Gelfer, whom we have enjoyed having on detail from the Department of Energy. 
   My own subcommittee staff has also had benefit of an agency detailee this year. Sean Marsan has been with us courtesy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and has done a wonderful job on a number of special projects. He has also performed well the laborious task of logging the thousands of member requests that the Subcommittee receives from members of this body. For those of my colleagues who have particular programs or projects funded in this bill--and I think I can safely say that includes each one of you--you owe Sean a debt of gratitude for keeping your ample requests in some sort of manageable order. 
   I also want to thank the subcommittee professional staff for all of their good work. Ginny James continues to do a great job with the many cultural agencies funded in this bill, as well as with the Indian Health Service and U.S. Geological Survey accounts. I am pleased that we were able this year to provide modest increases for both the NEA and NEH, and hope that the two endowments appreciate the role  Ginny has played in making this possible. It is not an easy thing to shepherd and provide counsel to the enthusiastic, but sometimes over-eager, arts community. 
   Anne McInerney of the subcommittee staff has been responsible for the Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs accounts, and this year took on the added responsibility of managing the land acquisition accounts for the four land management agencies. Members of this body continue to put individual land acquisition projects toward the top of their priority lists, making it quite a challenge to balance those priorities against the core operating needs of the agencies funded in this bill. Anne has done a marvelous job in this regard, as well as in helping me address the many management challenges faced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of the Special Trustee. 
   Leif Fonnesbeck is in his first full year with the Committee staff. He has in effect been thrown in the deep end by being assigned the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management accounts, where he probably will spend as much time on policy issues as on more traditional appropriations matters. Of the half dozen or so amendments that have been debated and voted upon during consideration of this bill, I think all but one have been related to Leif's area of responsibility. He has acquitted himself very well, and has proven to be a quick study. We are glad to have him with us. 
   Joe Norrell is also new to our subcommittee this year. Joe performs duties for both the Interior subcommittee and the VA/HUD subcommittee chaired by Senator BOND, and as such is frequently pulled in two different directions by two different masters. He has handled this difficult challenge with commitment and good humor, and has been a great help to both subcommittees. 
   Finally, I would also like to thank Kari Vander Stoep of my personal staff for her work on the issues in this bill that are of particular importance to the people of Washington state. Kari has done a wonderful job in this regard since her predecessor, Chuck Berwick, departed for business school. 
   Each of these individuals has already spent many late nights working on this bill, and will likely spend many more such nights over the coming weeks as we move to conference with the House. I want to express my own gratitude for their good work, and also convey the appreciation of the Ranking Member, Senator BYRD, and that of the Senate as a whole.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the RECORD shows, I voted present during the rollcall vote on passage of the FY2000 Defense Authorization Conference Report. My decision to cast this vote was prompted by Section 651 of the Conference Report, which would repeal the reduction in retired pay for U.S. military retirees who are employed by the federal government or hold federal office. As a retired U.S. Air Force Reserve officer, I stand to be benefitted by this provision when it is signed into law by the President. It is for this reason I voted present.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in recent years, I have become increasingly frustrated with the inability of the Forest Service to complete work on several small hydroelectric projects located on the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest in my State. The Service's inability to make important decisions on these renewable energy resources is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the President's Northwest Forest Plan (``ROD'') which has stopped these projects from going forward. 
   The President's Northwest Forest Plan states clearly that multipurpose uses of the federal forests are not precluded, and that the plan must follow existing law applying to such uses. Yet, since its adoption in 1994, the Forest Service has and continues to paralyze the development of small hydroelectric projects by ignoring laws applying to multipurpose. This inaction has delayed and stifled review of such projects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--the agency responsible for issuing federal licenses for hydroelectric projects. 
   Forest Service interpretation of the ROD intrudes directly on the ability of the Commission to perform its hydroelectric licensing function of balancing development and nondevelopment issues. Both the Commission, when determining consistency with the purpose of a national forest under Section 4(e) of the Act, and the Forest Service, when determining whether to issue a special use permit, must apply existing law fairly. Forest Service inaction on pending projects (some of which have been under review for over a decade) prevents FERC from completing its licensing responsibilities. 
   In terms of federal forest management, the six small hydroelectric projects proposed for the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest are virtually inconsequential. All are located well above areas affecting anadromous fish, and would occupy a total of 10 to 40 acres each, with most of the sites being untouched except for the portions needed for project facilities. Adverse impacts to fish, wildlife or other environmental resources are subject to mitigation by FERC and the Forest Service. 
   Project proponents in my state have spent millions of dollars to secure approval of six projects located in the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest, including project design and environmental analysis necessary to gain approval from the Forest Service and FERC. In spite of the fact that the 1994 ROD instructs the Forest Service to use ``transition'' provisions to approve pending projects, it has not done so, and continues to add project review requirements not allowed by the ROD or existing law. As a result, the Forest Service is stopping FERC from making timely licensing decisions on these projects. Shifting standards of review and delay by the Forest Service have deprived project proponents of their right to rely upon clear standards for project approval before expending funds in reliance on such standards. 
   Many aspects of these projects were found to be in compliance with prior forest regulations and other environmental laws, and are being subjected to duplicative and inconsistent review. Provisions of the ROD developed for application to extremely large-scale timber harvest are not meant to impact small-scale hydroelectric projects. Timber management regulations are totally disproportionate with the scale of any potential environmental impacts of small scale hydroelectric facilities. In fact, the ROD itself explicitly recognizes that uses other than timber harvest do not require the same level of restrictions. 
   The Forest Service continues to use the ROD as a reason for imposing new study requirements, increasing mitigation demands, and ignoring agreements  on project compliance with forest plan standards and FERC requirements. Each new requirement adds onerous financial burdens on project proponents, delays project approval, and undermines the regulatory need for an end to project review so a final licensing decision can be made by FERC. 
   Actions by the Forest Service have placed that agency in direct conflict with FERC, a result not intended by the ROD. FERC's jurisdiction over hydroelectric project licensing is unaltered by the ROD, which itself calls for increased interagency cooperation, not confrontation. 
   Mr. President, I have tried in recent years through my position as Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for funding the Forest Service's annual budget to get some answers from this agency as to why it was holding up these hydroelectric projects. In 1995, I inserted language directing the Forest Service to ``conduct an expeditious review'' of projects covered by the ROD. In subsequent hearings, I have continued to ask agency witnesses for a status report. To date, none of the responses from the Forest Service have satisfied my concerns or adequately addressed this issue. 
   For this reason, I am introducing legislation today that would expedite the hydroelectric project review process. It will require the Forest Service to convey to permit holders and license applicants for these projects at fair market value the parcels of land necessary for development of these projects. While I would prefer and am still hopeful that this issue can be resolved in negotiations between the project proponents and the agency, clearly this process is broken and needs to be fixed. This legislation should serve as a catalyst for resolving outstanding hydroelectric project review issues. Project proponents deserve at least that much.

   Mr. GORTON. The Middle Fork Snoqualmie valley is 110,000 acres of forests, mountains, and rivers located just 45 minutes east of Seattle. Ninety-eight percent of the land is public ownership. In recent years, the valley has been plagued by dumping, indiscriminate shooting and general lawlessness. Strong efforts are being made, however, by federal agencies and conservation groups to turn the valley back into a place safe for recreationists. No other place in the Northwest presents such an opportunity to create a first-class recreation area so close to millions of people. 
   A key part of turning this valley back into an attractive place is providing better and safer access. The present road into the valley is unpaved, potholed and dusty. An improved, paved road would provide safer, more pleasant access and allow for better law enforcement. 
   The Federal Highways Administration, Western Federal Lands Division, currently has $5 million budgeted for a new Middle Fork highway. Local conservation groups in my state, however, feel that the kind of highway which the F.H.W.A. builds would amount to massive overkill. The F.H.W.A. is restricted by its design standards to build only one kind of road--a highway in every sense of the word, with huge cuts and fills, broad sweeping curves and a wide swath cleared of trees on both sides. Conservationists feel that such a highway would destroy the very qualities which make the Middle Fork valley an attractive place.

   Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator's interest and would like to explore a proposal submitted by my constituents interested in preserving and enhancing the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley. I believe an appropriate solution would be to transfer the monies appropriated to the Federal Highway Administration for this road project to the U.S. Forest Service, giving the U.S. Forest control over design of the road. The Forest Service is not so rigidly bound in its design standards as the Federal Highway Administration, and could construct a paved road which closely follows the alignment of the existing road and goes through the woods. Such a road would provide much improved access without compromising the valley's integrity. I look forward to working with my colleague from Alabama.

   Mr. GORTON. I would like to thank my colleague from Washington State. She has been out front on this issue, and I commend her for her persistence. 
   I look forward to working with Senator MURRAY during the reauthorization of the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety, a piece of legislation in which I will fully engage when it comes before the Senate Commerce Committee next year. While the interstate transportation of hazardous materials in above and underground pipelines has proven to be the safest and most cost-effective means to transport these materials, the Bellingham tragedy has once again alerted us to its tragic potential. During the OPS reauthorization process I intend to ensure that the Federal law  and the Federal agency are performing their jobs of ensuring that tragedies like the one in Bellingham are not repeated. I will work closely with Chairman MCCAIN, the Majority Leader and my Democratic colleagues to make this a top priority next year.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today is National Student Day. In honor of this day, I would like to congratulate an outstanding group of students from my home state. Recently, the SAT scores for Washington state's graduating classes of 1999 were released. At the top of the public school list were the graduates of the International School of Bellevue, averaging 601 on verbal and 590 on math. Both scores surpassed the national averages by almost one-hundred points. 
   In my visits to hundreds of schools across Washington state, I have seen the benefits of countless innovative reforms and programs. The International School of Bellevue is an example of what local educators can do when they are given the freedom and flexibility to create new and better ways to educate. 
   The International School is a public school that was created approximately eight years ago by highly innovative teachers from the Bellevue School District. The founders' vision was to create a school in which a student would be placed in the classroom based on his or her ability--not his or her age. The founders also wanted to create an atmosphere in which each student would maintain close relationships with the teachers, and would gain clear understanding of how our country fits into today's world. 
   At the Bellevue International School, each student is required to take seven classes each year which include humanities, international studies, math, science, a foreign language, fine arts, and fitness. Even though this school serves grades 6-12, there are not specific grade levels. Each student takes his or her courses at the student's own performance level, starting at level one and ranging up to level seven for each of the seven courses. 
   The students are also encouraged to spend one month abroad at one of the International School's sister schools. While abroad, the students attend classes and are treated as regular students of their guest schools. 
   In order to attend the International School, students are not required to take an exam, submit test scores or previous grades. Any student with the desire and motivation to attend this school can submit his or her name into a lottery out of which names of the new students are chosen. 
   The Principal of the International School said that her students, ``are not necessarily the smartest kids, but they have a terrific work ethic, converse with their teachers, and are highly resourceful and responsible for themselves and for others.'' 
   I applaud the International School's class of 1999 for its magnificent scores  on the SAT. I also applaud the rest of the student body for its passion for learning and for taking advantage of this tremendous opportunity. I know that each student who graduates from the International School will leave with an outstanding education and greater understanding of our country, our world, and his or her place in it. 
   The International School's impressive performance on the SAT demonstrates that when given the flexibility to create a program, local educators will succeed. I believe that we must give control of federal education dollars to the states and local school districts because those who work with out children on a daily basis--their parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members--best understand the needs of our children and should have the most significant role in setting education policy and priorities in our schools. 
   Mr. President, I might be a bit disingenuous in sharing this praise with you if I were not to point out that my oldest grandchild, my granddaughter, Betsy Nortz, just won the lottery last spring and started last week as a sixth grader at Belleview International. Already, in just a few days, she reports great interest in the intellectual challenges to which she is subjected. She and I and her parents look forward to a fine career in the single school, I believe, in the State of Washington in the public system with the highest SAT scores. 
   The students and educators at the International School of Bellevue deserve our recognition and I hope my colleagues will join me in applauding their achievements. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is another example of Members of the Senate attempting to say they know much more about a particular business than do the people who run that business and depend upon customer satisfaction in order to run it profitably. 
   Fortunately, it is now only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. However, it nonetheless, with respect to involuntary exclusion from planes, applies to about 1 person in 10,000 and is therefore a sledgehammer used to crush a fly, and does it in a way which will be either ineffective because the information that passengers get will be of no  use to them or will cut down on the number of tickets that are sold which will raise the prices passengers pay. 
   The provision about Internet pricing, if implemented, will simply mean there will be no lower prices offered on the Internet than there are elsewhere. That will also raise the prices some passengers pay. 
   The voluntary attitudes of the airlines are only beginning to go into effect. Even the GAO report quoted by the Senator from Oregon reads:  
   The real deal is what the individual airlines come out with in the plans. Once they do, they can be held accountable.  
   We ought to leave this to that accountability and not decide we know the airline business better than the airlines themselves.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been widely discussed relating to CAFE standards; that is to say, the fuel efficiency standards of automobiles and small trucks sold in the United States. Now, I want to quote an argument against this proposal made in a committee hearing on CAFE standards.  
   In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines and car models, including most full-size sedans and station wagons. It would restrict the industry from producing subcompact-size cars or even smaller ones.  
   Mr. President, you may well ask me when that hearing took place because you were unaware that hearings on this subject had taken place. That question would be well put because that hearing took place in 1974, 25 years ago. That statement was made by automobile manufacturers in connection with the fuel efficiency standards that were discussed during that year and were implemented. As a result of the implementation of those standards, we are saving 3 million barrels of oil per day in the United States as compared with the 17 million gallons per day that cars and trucks, in fact, use. 
   In other words, even from the point of view of a relatively conservative Senator, as I consider myself, we have an example of a highly successful regulatory action on the part of the Government of the United States, a regulatory action that took place 25 years ago and was, for all practical purposes, fully implemented within 6 years of the time of its implementation. That is the first notable point about the subject we are discussing today. 
   The second is that the argument I quoted turned out to be wholly inaccurate. The evidence of that inaccuracy, of course, is on every street, road, and highway in the United States. The genius of American manufacturers created an automobile that met all of the fuel efficiency standards that were implemented a quarter of a century ago without a substantial downsizing of our automobiles' weight, with a tremendous contribution to cleaner air, and with the contribution of saving 3 million gallons of gasoline each and every day of each and every year, every single gallon of which, where we are using it, would come from imports and from overseas, further exacerbating our trade deficits. 
   I find it particularly curious that we should look back at an experiment so totally successful in every respect, in cleaning up our air, in reducing our use of petroleum products, in reducing our trade deficits, and in saving money for the American people, and say: Not only are we not going to repeat that experiment, we are not even going to study whether we ought to repeat that experiment. What we have done in the Congress is to tell our Federal agencies that they may not pursue studies and come up with rules and regulations and recommendations as to a second round of improving our automobile fuel efficiency either for regular passenger automobiles or for small trucks or for SUVs. 
   The status, in connection with this bill, of course, is relatively simple. This Senate bill does not prevent the Federal Government from going ahead with such studies and making such recommendations. The House bill does, once again, as we have for the last several years, prohibit even these studies. 
   The amendment before us now is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Senate should not accept that House provision. It is neither more nor less than that. Every one of the 98 Senators, in addition to you and me, has been deluged by statements from opponents to this modest sense-of-the-Senate resolution, stating, first, that it would make our highways less safe, even though our death rate on our highways is remarkably lower now--I think three times lower than it was before we 
   went through this experiment the first time--that there is no way the automobile manufacturers can meet the requirements that would be imposed if we allowed these studies to go forward without going back to sub-subcompacts--an argument that was shown to be totally fallacious and without reason some 25 years ago. 
   In short, there is not a single argument being presented against this amendment that was not presented 25 years ago to this body and to the other body and to the people of the United States and proven to be without merit. 
   Can we learn nothing from the past? Are we so frightened, as Members of the Senate, that we are not even going to try to determine in an orderly fashion whether or not we can do better with respect to the fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine? The proposition, I think, is bizarre, that we should prohibit even a study and a set of proposed regulations on this subject. 
   There could possibly be more bite to this argument if what we were faced with was the imminent imposition of new requirements that were highly unreasonable in nature and about which it might be argued that they were impossible to attain. If we were faced with a proposed amendment that said the Federal Government could use no part of this appropriation to enforce such standards, that would be one thing. But what the opponents to this sense-of-the-Senate resolution are saying is: Don't even look into the question. Don't do anything. Don't try to learn whether or not we can come up with more efficient internal combustion engines. Let's just ignore it.

   Mr. GORTON. I was about to say, for the benefit of my friend from Nevada, isn't it fortunate that the Congress of the United States, in the first decade of the 19th century, didn't prohibit the development of a steam engine because it might explode? 
   That is basically what the arguments against the amendment the Senator from Nevada and I have proposed amount to. My gosh, something bad might happen if you did something. But, of course, the argument against the steam engine in 1810, or 1812, or 1814 would have been stronger because they knew nothing about it. We have gone through this process before, and it was a complete success. But we are now told, not only should we not go through the experiment again, we should not even study it; we should not even try  to come up with facts that would justify it or--and I think it is very unlikely--perhaps not justify making any change in the present system. 
   Now, I think both the Senator from Nevada and I believe such a study would come up with more significant CAFE standards. But I don't think the Senator from Nevada, even more than I, has any idea what they would be, how far they would go, what we would find to be totally successful or not. We just want to find out whether or not we can't do something that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil, help clean up our air, and save money for the American purchaser of automobiles, small trucks and, of course, the fuel required to run them. That is all.

   Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nevada is as learned as he is wise, and his reference to Luddites in the late 18th and early 19th century England is entirely correct. The word has come down to us today, referring to those who are so fearful of changes in our technology that in one way or another they would prevent it. 
   The point he makes is particularly important, and it is one that I want to continue to emphasize to Members. We are not debating a law that will mandate a specific new set of fuel economy standards for automobiles and small trucks. We are not even debating whether or not a specific set of standards should be imposed after a study of their feasibility and desirability is completed. We are debating a proposition that says we should go forward in an orderly fashion, have this determination made by people who are expert in the field and who study it carefully and must follow all of the procedural requirements for setting rules and regulations, all of which will be vulnerable to future debates in the Senate should proposals be made that seem somehow or another unreasonable. 
   There is not a single Member of the Senate, from the most conservative to the most liberal, who has not at one time or another been critical of some rule or regulation imposed by some agency of the Federal Government. Every Member of the Senate--and for that matter, the House of Representatives--knows how to bring up debate on that subject, the debate over this appropriations bill, or some other bill relating to transportation. But what we have today from the opponents to this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is a statement that we are ignorant of what might happen if we engage in another round of fuel efficiency standards and we want to remain ignorant. That is essentially what they are talking about.

   Mr. GORTON. Just before my friend from Nevada came to the floor, I began my remarks with a quotation, which sounded so remarkably similar to what we have heard in the last few days about this amendment, and it is particularly appropriate. For the Senator's benefit and for others, I will repeat it:  
   In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines and car models, including most full-size sedans and station wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing subcompact sized cars, or even smaller ones.  
   That was a statement by the duly authorized representative of the Ford Motor Company in 1974 in the hearings on the bill that allowed for the first corporate average fuel economy standards to take place. Now the Ford Motor Company, of course, was far more resourceful in its technology than it was in its language. And when these requirements were imposed, the Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Chrysler, and the rest of the manufacturers met them, and they met them gratefully to the advantage of the people of the United States, who ended up with far cleaner air. It is impossible to imagine what our air would be like today if we were all driving 1974 model automobiles--saving billions of dollars in fuel costs, saving the economy of the United States all of the costs of that extra fuel, all of which would have ended up coming from overseas, given our dependence on foreign oil at the time. 
   One of the interesting things as we go into this debate right now, I tell my friend, is that a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal reported that the same company, the Ford Motor Company, is currently developing technology to increase fuel economy of its truck fleet by as much as 15 percent. 
   The article in the Wall Street Journal said that internal documents posted on the world wide web show--I am quoting now:  
   Ford could significantly increase its fuel economy on some of its biggest and most popular trucks without losing the things people buy trucks for, horsepower and pulling power.  
   That is another illustration of the fact that an argument which was utterly invalid in 1974 is utterly invalid in 1999. 
   Members of this body 25 years ago might have been excused for giving great credence to that argument. After all, we didn't know what was going to happen. It is very difficult to give credence to that argument given the tremendously positive results of the regulations which were adopted in 1974.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the question, of course, answers itself. It was. 
   Americans have acquired far greater choice today after the implementation of those fuel efficiency standards than they had previously. The interesting part of the ad, which was just handed to me--I had not previously seen it--says: Say yes to consumer choice and say no to a CAFE increase. In fact, the consumer can't choose a fuel efficient SUV at the present time. There isn't any consumer choice there. They are not competing over that proposition, though we may hope that someday in the future the Ford Motor Company, if it is thought correct, will do so. But as consumer choice increased after the last CAFE standards were imposed, so am I confident they will increase the next time around. 
   I greatly enjoyed this conversation with my friend from Nevada. I suspect he has more to say on the subject. I know the Senator from California wishes to speak on this subject. I don't want to monopolize the conversation, even on the pro side, and we will have opponents. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is often said, I think accurately, that what differentiates human beings from most other animals, most other mammals, is the extraordinary ability of human beings to learn from experience. Yet on the floor of the Senate this afternoon we have heard eloquent statements opposing this current amendment that indicate that experience is of no value to some Members and to some of their arguments. 
   Mr. President, 25 years ago the predecessors of the opponents to this amendment repeatedly stated on the floor of the Senate, as well as in the hearing rooms of the Senate, that to require more fuel-efficient automobiles and small trucks was to endanger the safety and the lives of the American people and to sentence them to driving in subcompacts and sub-subcompacts. 
   There are only two differences between the circumstances of the argument in 1974 and the circumstances of the argument in 1999. The first of those differences is that all of the arguments of those who opposed setting higher fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and small trucks made in 1974 were proved dramatically to be in error. At one level, the most important of those arguments was that people would no longer have choice; they would all be forced into smaller automobiles. Here it is 25 years later. We know that is not the case. The requirements imposed in 1974 were, for all practical purposes, completely met within a period of 6 years, and the course has been essentially flat since that day. 
   Every single day of the week, every year, 7 days a week, 
   365 days a year, the people of the United States save 3 million gallons of gasoline. Multiply 3 million gallons by $1.50 a gallon. That is $4.5 million. They pollute the air less; they spend less money; they contribute less to our international trade deficit that continues to grow year after year. And, second, our highways are far safer now than they were then. Traffic deaths per million miles driven have declined by more than 50 percent in the years since those fuel efficiency standards were imposed on the American people. Yet we hear some of the same arguments being made over and over again. 
   But there is another difference between the argument in 1999 and the argument in 1974. In 1974, the Senate was debating whether or not to allow specific new standards to go into effect. In 1999, we are arguing whether or not to allow the Federal Government to engage in a proceeding that determines whether or not new and more fuel-efficient standards are appropriate and achievable. So in addition to ignoring history and experience, the opponents have to say that they oppose knowledge, that they oppose even a vitally important study of if and how much fuel efficiency standards can be improved, consistent with safety and consistent with the economic well-being of the American people. 
   While I have not heard every word that has been stated on this floor in opposition to this bill, it does seem to me there is at least a minor difference. There does not seem to have been a claim that more fuel-efficient cars will not benefit the environment that is to say, to cause us to have cleaner air and fewer emissions into our air. Whatever the debate was in 1974, that is not a statement now. Nor has any one of our opponents stated that it is a poor idea to save the American people millions of dollars a day in their bill for motor vehicle fuel. Nor have they made any statement that somehow or another our huge trade deficit, largely caused by imported petroleum products, is a matter to which we as Americans should be indifferent. 
   Almost all of their argument has been on the safety issue. But it has been on the safety issue in the teeth of the experience of the American society, and it has been on the safety issue in the teeth of the proposition that if we carry out the policies contained in this amendment, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we are not automatically going to impose new fuel efficiency standards. We are simply going to go into an orderly process to determine whether or not new standards are feasible and, if so, how strict they should be and, if so, how long it should take to implement them.  
   I find it breathtaking that Members of the Senate should say, no, we don't want that knowledge. We are not even willing to wait until some specific standards are proposed and specific knowledge gained to debate whether or not the imposition of those standards is worthwhile. 
   No, we want the Senate to vote to stay ignorant, not even to learn what good public policy might be and what any of the offsets to that good public policy might be as well. 
   Mr. President, I am not a great fan of the current national administration, but I do not think anything irrevocable is going to take place in the next year, in any event, and certainly not over the objections of the Congress of the United States. But I am not so mistrustful of a group of professionals that I am willing to say even to this administration we should not allow them to examine this issue. Incidentally, this freeze has gone through Republican administrations, as well as Democratic administrations, in any event. 
   No, there are only two arguments being made against this amendment. The substantive argument is that we should ignore history and believe arguments in 1999 that were made in 1974 and shown to be entirely invalid in 1974; and second, the proposition that we should remain ignorant, that this is not important enough, not significant enough to the American people that we should even begin a process of determining whether or not we can clean up our air, make our cars more fuel efficient, become less dependent on foreign oil, and at the same time, increase the safety standards in our automobiles. 
   The debate is neither more complicated nor less complicated than just that. It should be understood by everyone, and I plead with my colleagues in this body to allow this process to go forward and to debate a real proposal, not a theoretical set of objections that were invalid in 1974 and are equally invalid in 1999.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first point. I regret that the Senators from Michigan believe that the automobile industry located in that State and the magnificent workers who are employed there are unable to compete with foreign automobile companies when we try to make our automobiles more fuel efficient. In fact, they have shown their magnificent ability to compete, and to compete very well, in the past decade. I am certain that they would continue to do so. 
   Second, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution simply asks the conference committee members from the Senate to reject a House provision that says that nothing can take place. It certainly does not say that the conference committee cannot condition the moving forward of the Department of Transportation on future CAFE standards in any way it would like to do so. But the net effect, as I have said before, of the House position, supported by the opponents of this amendment, is that we need to put our heads in the sand; we don't need to study--as a matter of fact, we should be prohibited from studying whether or not we can improve the fuel efficiency of our automobiles and small trucks, improve the quality of our air, reduce the cost of fuel to the average American consumer, reduce our trade deficit, all consistent with the safety of our drivers and of the passengers in our automobiles. 
   I, for one, am convinced that we can do so. But more than that, I am convinced that we ought to determine whether or not we can do so, and the opponents of this amendment simply say we should not even try. 
   Mr. President, that is a terribly pessimistic attitude toward the technological ability of the people in the industries of the United States, and one that I don't think the Senate of the United States should accept. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague from Washington state. She has been out front on this issue, and I commend her for her persistence. 
   I look forward to working with Senator MURRAY during the reauthorization of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, a piece of legislation in which I will fully engage when it comes before the Senate Commerce Committee next year. While the interstate transportation of hazardous materials in above and underground pipelines has proven to be the safest and most cost-effective means to transport these materials, the Bellingham tragedy has once again alerted us to its tragic potential. During the OPS reauthorization process I intend to ensure that the federal law and the federal agency are performing their jobs of ensuring that tragedies like the one in Billingham are not repeated. I will work closely with Chairman MCCAIN, the majority leader, and my Democratic colleagues to make this a top priority next year.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the second-degree Bryan-Wyden amendment regarding the Forest Service budget. By agreement, a vote on or in relation to that amendment will take place at 10:30 a.m. Further amendments to the Interior appropriations bill are expected throughout today's session. Senators, therefore, can expect votes throughout the day in anticipation of completing action on the bill. It is expected that the Senate will have approximately 2 hours of debate on S.J. Res. 33, with a vote on final passage during today's session, with the time to be determined by the two leaders. 
   For the remainder of the week, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I just read a text that was submitted to me. I am going to offer what I hope is a slight correction to that for the benefit of all Senators. I believe, as manager of the bill, it is highly possible there are only two other unresolved matters in connection with the Interior appropriations bill. One is, of course, this Bryan-Wyden amendment that will be voted on in about 1 hour. The other is cloture on the Hutchison amendment. There was a vote on that cloture last night. It failed, but it seemed to have failed primarily by reason of absent Senators. The majority leader moved to reconsider and, of course, can bring up that motion at any time. 
   As manager of the bill, I do not know of any other amendments that will require rollcall votes. It does not mean there might not be one or two, but I do not know of any others. We now have two managers' amendments ready: one dealing with legislative matters and one dealing with money matters, but I hope we will have settled all other outstanding issues in connection with the bill. In any event, if there are Senators who wish to bring up amendments that they reserved way back in August with respect to the bill that are not settled in these two managers' amendments, I certainly urge them to come to the floor and to be prepared to present them immediately after the 10:30 vote on the Bryan-Wyden second-degree amendment. 
   With that, Mr. President, I see Senator WYDEN present, I see Senator CRAIG present, and so we are ready for debate.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in fiscal year 1990, the Forest Service sold 11 billion board feet of timber for harvest and for productive use. For the last 2 years, we have authorized through our appropriations 3.6 billion board feet of harvest. The administration proposed in its budget for this year 3.2 billion, a further reduction, and a reduction from 1990 of 71 percent, as my colleague from Idaho pointed out. 
   Peculiarly, or interestingly enough, the Forest Service in its actual National Forest Land Management Plan allows for a harvest of about twice this amount. It is only the appropriations level recommended by the administration, and for that matter by this Congress, that has the level almost 50 percent below what the Forest Service plans say is both economically and environmentally sustainable. 
   That is the first peculiar argument.  
   Second, the committee bill does not increase the allowable harvest. It simply allows the same harvest for next year that appropriations bills passed overwhelmingly by this body and signed by the President have permitted for the course of the last 2 years. 
   The question is whether or not we should continue to move toward no harvest at all, as many of the national environmental organizations recommend, or whether we should consider continuing the relatively modest harvests that were promised by this President and this administration at the beginning of his Presidency, most particularly in the Pacific Northwest. 
   The Senator from Idaho pointed out that this is not exclusively a Northwest issue; that it applies to forests in other parts of the country, including the hardwood forests in the Northeast. 
   The original Bryan amendment distributes this money relatively widely--a fairly small percentage of the overall Interior appropriations bill--including a modest amount which simply is not to be spent at all and will go to the national debt. Most of that modest amount, however, is taken up and spent by the Wyden second-degree amendment that is to be directed at surveys of various species in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I should like to make the following announcement. 
   We will have that managers' amendment--I think there is only one that is possible; it may be in two sections--ready within the next half hour or so to present. It does represent an accommodation of the requests of many Members, with the understanding of all Members. 
   I think it will take only a very few minutes to present and to have it accepted. At that point, we will have only the Hutchison amendment outstanding. The majority leader has reserved the right to ask for reconsideration of the cloture motion that was defeated yesterday. I suspect when he chooses to do that, we will in a relatively short period of time finish debate and dispose of the Hutchison amendment one way or another and then go to final passage of the Interior appropriations bill. 
   That means, as far as I am concerned, I am going to vacate the floor at this point. Whenever the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation wants to start his bill, he can do so. I will ask him for the right to interrupt at some point when I am ready with the managers' amendment and present it then. I see no reason to keep the Senate from moving forward now. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I concur with this observation about the poor BIA oversight and management of locally operated TPA programs. The BIA has not been able to tell the Senate just how these funds are spend by tribal governments. Other than broad categories, the tribes themselves do not have to report how these funds are meeting trial needs and goals. There are so many eligible uses for these funds that tribes do not report TPA spending to the BIA with any specificity. In public safety, for example, TPA funds can be spend for police cars. Natural resource funds can be spent on growing blue corn or improving a fish hatchery. 
   The BIA has little information about how tribal goals are being met with TPA funds, and TPA funds make up almost half of the entire BIA operations budget for Indian programs. Any effort to help us clarify the precise use of TPA funds will be a major step forward in accountability for both tribes and the BIA. I welcome a pilot effort to move toward that goal.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act listing of various runs of salmon throughout the Northwest has been a wake-up call for Washingtonians. We have seen an unprecedented decline in a historically vibrant salmon population, relied upon by countless sportsmen, commercial and tribal fishermen, and those of us who see salmon as a Northwest cultural icon. 
   And for years, at all levels of government, we've spent billions of dollars in an effort to recover this important species, but we've seen little in return. Millions and millions of dollars have been spent on massive studies. Millions of dollars have fueled growing bureaucracies to address the problem and create new regulations that may or may not save the fish. 
   In all the flurry of activity and spending, one, largely unrecognized effort has done more in our rivers and streams to improve salmon habitat than almost anything else in which we've invested our resources. Across Washington state, small, local volunteer groups spend their weekends restoring streams, revegetating riparian areas and creating healthy, inviting places for salmon to return. They recruit people from all over the community to spend a few hours on the weekend working in their local stream, river, or anywhere else that will make a difference for the fish. 
   In many cases, these locally-grown groups are able to work cooperatively with private landowners to restore streams and rivers that run through their property. These efforts achieve results and make all parties satisfied with the outcome in a way that government-mandated directives could never do. 
   That's why my 1999 Interior Appropriations bill includes a $4 million appropriation for these groups to be able to continue their hard work and worthy efforts. The money will be appropriated to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to distribute, as quickly as possible, to locally-organized, on-the-ground salmon enhancement organizations. 
   These groups' potential for positive contributions to salmon recovery are immeasurable. For instance, a stream on the North Shore of Hood Canal would be an excellent salmon spawning and over wintering habitat if it were not for man-made barriers to fish passage. The Hood Canal Salmon Enhancement Group (HCSEG) would like to remove the 3 foot diameter pipe, which the stream now runs through, and correct the immediate four foot drop in the stream level. Replacing the pipe with an appropriately sized culvert and fishway would open up 1.7 miles of habitat for chum, coho, and steelhead. Hood Canal SEG likes to call these projects ``no-brainers'' because the habitat already exists, the fish just need to be able to get there. 
   Local residents are critical to these salmon recovery efforts, where intimate historic knowledge of seasonal flows, fish populations, and specific migratory trends don't typically exist outside the community. 
   Another group, Long Live the Kings (LLTK), is contributing to the recovery of listed salmonids in Hood Canal. At their Lilliwaup facility, LLTK is operating a captive rearing and supplementation program for threatened steelhead and summer chum. I was happy to have helped find funding for this program last year, and am pleased to continue this support. 
   While in the state during our August recess, I met with the Nooksack Salmon Enhancement Association out of Bellingham, Washington. This group, with the passionate leadership of volunteers like Mike and Elaine McRory, have taken on habitat restoration projects in urban and rural areas alike, successfully soliciting the cooperation of private landowners to recover local stocks. Landowner participation is often contagious, and NSEA has seen one project on a given stream turn into two, three, or even more. 
   It should be clear that organizations across Washington State, not just those within the Puget Sound basin, are eligible to apply for these funds. In fact my staff will be traveling to Okanogan county at the end of this month to introduce members of the local community to NFWF representatives. 
   Grants for local groups through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation provide a much needed funding source for long overdue projects ranging from Skagit FEG's Little Baker River Side Channel project, which would open one mile of chinook spawning and rearing habitat, to riparian restoration in Newaukum and Portage Creeks, conducted by Mid-Sound FEG and Stilli-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force. 
   The amount appropriated to the NFWF does include an earmark for a group that deserves special recognition for their efforts to clean up our local water, essential to salmon recovery success. River CPR's Puget Sound Drain Guard Campaign will employ volunteer labor to install devices aimed at trapping 90 percent of the oil and sediment that typically flows into storm drains. It is evident that this small amount of money is going to go a long way towards recovering salmon across our state. 
   Here is what some of these groups have to say about this initiative:  
   ``Senator GORTON'S proposal to use the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to direct funding to the local level is very innovative and will ensure that the funds are used where they most help fish, on the ground,'' said one Mid Sound Fisheries Enhancement Group board member. 
   Alison Studley writes, ``As a member of the Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group (Skagit FEG), I whole-heartedly support your endeavor to get salmon dollars to support on-the-ground projects. Local organizations are ready, willing and able to take on this challenge.'' 
   In sum: I believe that Washingtonians and local salmon restoration organizations--not bureaucracies in Washington, D.C.--are in the best position to make decisions that will return salmon. That's why my 1999 Interior Bill includes money for these local groups--who have been working on this problem for years--so they can decide how to restore the fisheries. It's time for the federal government to let those who will be affected by the decisions make these decisions. Salmon are a critical part of the Northwest way of life, so let Northwesterners decide how to fix this problem without being told how to do it from Washington, D.C.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with respect to the Interior appropriations bill, there will be a vote on or in relation to the Bryan amendment and the second-degree Wyden amendment tomorrow morning at 10:30. 
   It may well be that that will be the last contested matter in connection with this appropriations bill other than the disposition of the Hutchison amendment. I am not entirely certain of that at this point. But we are close to having agreed-upon managers' amendments both with respect to legislative matters and with respect to money matters, with the exception of the motion to reconsider the invocation of cloture. 
   For that reason, this is a notice and a request to Members that if they have other matters they wish debated, or if they have other matters they wish brought to the managers' attention, they should do so very promptly. We will not in the managers' amendment dispose of all the amendments which were reserved, but I think we probably will be able to take care of all of those that look as if they would be otherwise brought up and voted on. 
   We are tantalizingly close to finishing. But, of course, we will not finish or go to third reading under the present circumstances at least until after disposition of the motion to reconsider the motion to invoke cloture, and that motion will certainly pass, and there will be at least one more vote on cloture itself.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the effect of the Robb amendment would be to terminate all harvests on all public lands in the United States and much recreational activity that requires any kind of improvement. It requires between $5 billion and $9 billion worth of wildlife surveys beyond endangered species, surveys that are unnecessary and so expensive that it will not be wise to go ahead with any of them. 
   The amendment does not require the Forest Service or the Secretary of the Interior to do anything. It simply authorizes them to conduct their business in the future as they have conducted it in the past. If they do not want to, if they want to go after these surveys, they still can. Section 329 is entirely discretionary and is entirely within the power of the administration to interpret as it wills.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the present order of business, of course, is a continuing debate on the Hutchison amendment. There will be a cloture motion filed on that amendment that will ripen either Monday or Tuesday; I am not certain which. The Senator from California has justifiably, in defending her position, asked for assurances that there will not be a cloture motion filed on the whole bill, which could theoretically deprive her of her right to continue debate until some conclusion with respect to the Hutchison amendment. 
   I assure her that will not take place. Her amendment will be disposed of one way or another--either by the adoption of cloture and the eventual vote on the amendment, or by a failure of cloture and its withdrawal before any cloture motion will be filed on the bill as a whole. In fact, I can say I don't see any reason or need that we should have to file cloture on the bill as a whole. We are making good progress on it. There are other amendments we can discuss and vote on today, and perhaps even on Monday, so it may very well be that the disposition of her amendment is the last significant matter. 
   In any event, I assure her that her rights will be protected, and that, of course, is a necessary precondition to my asking unanimous consent to set the Hutchison amendment aside and go on to other amendments. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, has such an amendment. So I hope with that assurance, it is sufficient that we can go forward on another subject.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note the presence of the senior Senator from Illinois, who has an amendment related to grazing. My inclination is, since he is here and ready to go, he should go next. 
   I think it is important to inform our Members that we hope to accomplish more business during the course of the day. The particular large piece of business that we are closest to, an agreement on a collection of several amendments that do not relate to amounts of money in the bill, we hope shortly to have unanimous consent for. We are also working, of course, on a managers' amendment. Many of the amendments that have been reserved are likely to be the subject of a managers' amendment. I have discussed this matter with a number of individual Members. 
   I say to the Senator from Illinois, whether we will be able to get to a vote on his amendment this afternoon I am not certain. I hope we will. He has cooperated in this connection. I would like to see a couple of more votes this afternoon, but I am not sure we will. But let's begin the debate and we will see what its dynamics are and determine how far we can go.

   I regret that we haven't been able to go further today or to complete action on any of them. On the other hand, I think during the last literally 24 hours of the clock we have accomplished a great deal in connection with this bill. I hope that can be completed by the end of this Tuesday.

   Ms. Pechman was chosen by a selection committee jointly appointed by my colleague, Senator MURRAY, and myself, and was jointly recommended by the two Senators from the State of Washington to President Clinton. The President has therefore engaged fully in the normal advice and consent process for choosing Federal judges for this vitally important lifetime position. 
   Judge Pechman has significant judicial experience. She has served as a superior court judge in King County, Washington, for a period of 11 years, handling a wide range of cases, taking an active role in improving the administration of justice, and instructing and teaching other judges and lawyers. Before becoming a judge, Marsha Pechman worked as a deputy prosecuting attorney in King County and was later made a partner in a significant, major law firm in the city of Seattle. 
   I ask my colleagues to join with my colleague from the State of Washington and myself in approving a first-rate nomination on the part of the President, Judge Marsha Pechman, to serve as United States District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington.

<DOCNO>106-gorton-wa-1-19990908</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, debate on the Interior appropriations bill took place on two separate occasions before the August recess. Two significant amendments have already been voted upon. We now have a unanimous consent agreement for listing all of the amendments that are in order, and they are 66 in number. 
   A substantial share, perhaps 20 or more of those amendments, will either be accepted or will be a part of one omnibus managers' amendment at the end of this debate. I suspect several others will not actually be brought up for discussion in the Senate, but it seems apparent to this Senator, as manager of the bill, that as many as a dozen may require some amount of debate and very likely a vote. 
   Up to four of those amendments are amendments that were included as a part of the bill as it was reported by the Subcommittee on Interior appropriations and by the full Appropriations Committee, which fell under the revised rule XVI. One of those is an amendment originally drafted by the Senator from Missouri. He will bring it up at this point. 
   I have asked the Democratic manager, Senator BYRD, to get me a list of amendments that Members of his party wish to bring up. He is in the process of doing that at the moment. But this is an announcement that we are now open and ready for business. It may be that we will, from time to time, set amendments aside so we can hear debate on others. The majority leader may decide to stack votes on some of these amendments. But this is a very short week. We are starting this at 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. We have all day and into the evening tomorrow for these debates. The majority leader has announced, due to the Jewish holiday, that there will be no votes on Friday. I hope we will have made substantial progress on the bill by the end of tomorrow's session of the Senate. That is possible, of course, only if Members on both sides--both Republicans and Democrats--are willing to bring their amendments to the floor. 
   The one other amendment I have discussed seriously at this point is one by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. ENZI, and the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, on gambling. That amendment is ready to be accepted. Now I see two Members on the floor. If the Senator from Florida--who was told he could go first--would like to bring his amendment up now and submit the rest of the various statements on it, I understand the amendment will be accepted in relatively short order. Is my understanding correct?

But I ask that we not take that voice vote at this time, until we are apprised of the desires of the Senator from Hawaii. 
   Under the circumstances, the Senator from Missouri being here, I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized and that we set this amendment aside to deal with another.

   We have heard, on the other hand, the senior Senator from Illinois wishes to speak against the Lott amendment proposed for him by Senator BOND and will ask for a vote on that. So we will await his presence and his speech on that subject before there is any attempt to bring that amendment to a vote. But for all other Members with the other 64 amendments, now that we have started to deal with two of them, we would certainly appreciate their coming to the floor and showing a willingness to debate. The Democratic manager, Senator BYRD, and I are certainly going to be happy to grant unanimous consent to move off of one amendment and onto another, I am sure, to keep the debate going with the hope of making progress on the bill. 
   With that, however, I yield the floor.

   Before I present that, I say we will be in session long enough this evening for anyone who wishes to do so to speak on the Bond amendment. I believe the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak. The Senator from Missouri (Mr. BOND) may return for that subject. Senator HUTCHISON wishes to speak again on her amendment. There may be other speeches on that. There are three or four people here to speak on the Robb amendment. I want all of the speeches on each of these subjects to be consolidated into one point in the RECORD.

   I hope during most of tomorrow, however, we will deal with other amendments that can be completed and dispensed with. By the time we get to a vote on the cloture, we are pretty close to the end of debate on this bill. I don't know if that is true or not. We will have dealt today in whole or in part with 4 of the 66 amendments that are reserved for the Interior appropriations bill. I trust some will go faster than many of those today. 
   I will state the unanimous consent agreement. Then I 
   intend to speak briefly on the Robb amendment. I believe the Presiding Officer and Senator CRAIG will also speak on that.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in just a moment I will have several agreed-upon amendments to propound and hopefully they will be agreed to very quickly. 
   Then Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire is here with the first contested amendment. I hope we can finish as many as three amendments that are likely to require rollcalls between now and 1 o'clock. After the Smith amendment that deals with the National Endowment for the Arts, I hope we will have an opportunity to go to an amendment by Mr. GRAHAM of Florida and Mr. ENZI, relating to Indian gambling. While I have not found the Senator yet, I would like, after that, to go to an amendment by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, on forest roads. Others may intervene. 
   We also have a number of amendments that will be agreed upon from time to time. My own reading of our list of amendments is that they are reasonably limited, even at this point. Several require votes. I hope none will require a long and extensive debate. The majority leader wants, as early as possible, to get an agreed-upon list of amendments. I suspect we will be asking for unanimous consent to say all amendments must be filed by, say, sometime this afternoon. So Members who have amendments about which they have not notified the managers are encouraged to do so as promptly as possible. 
   I believe the majority leader wishes to finish this bill, as well as the reconciliation bill on taxes, before the recess begins sometime tomorrow.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, argues for his amendment striking the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts, as I have listened to him, on two grounds. The first ground is that the appropriation is unconstitutional. The second ground is that it is undesirable. 
   I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that Members of the Senate of the United States have a responsibility, just as do sworn members of the  judiciary of the United States, to consider carefully the constitutional implications of all of the work they do. I disagree with the Senator from New Hampshire, however, on what seems to me an easy question to answer: the constitutionality of an appropriation of this nature. In fact, I think the Senator from New Hampshire implied or illustrated the weakness of his own argument when he said, just a few moments ago, why should the people of the United States be paying for an activity of this sort as against paying for the education of our children, among other items that he listed. 
   The education of our children is no more mentioned in the Constitution of the United States than are the arts or any other cultural activity. Yet it is clearly constitutional, as well as appropriate, for the Congress of the United States to support the education of our children and, for that matter, our young people through college and through graduate school, and we do so with increasing enthusiasm in each and every year. 
   The same interpretation of the Constitution of the United States that allows and encourages us to do that for education allows us to do so for cultural activities, including the National Endowment for the Arts. If support for the National 
   Endowment for the Arts is unconstitutional, so is support for the Library of Congress--I see nothing about a library in the Constitution of the United States--so is support for the National Gallery of Art, for the Smithsonian Institution, and for the Air and Space Museum, for all of the other cultural activities enthusiastically and, I may say, appropriately supported by the Congress of the United States. 
   No, there is no precedent and no serious legal argument against the constitutionality of our support, modest as it is, for the National Endowment for the Arts. There has been, however, a considerable argument during the course of the last decade or perhaps two decades over the appropriateness of the support for the arts or, alternatively, over the way in which the National Endowment for the Arts spends its money. Again, I think a vast majority of the Members of both Houses of Congress think, in the abstract, that it is appropriate to spend a modest amount of money on the arts. 
   From the very beginning of the Republic, we have decorated this building with all kinds of works of art that are not necessary for the functioning of the Congress of the United States. I don't think anyone has ever challenged either the appropriateness or the constitutionality of the use of Federal money for the arts in that respect. 
   But climaxing in 1995, there was widespread criticism of a significant number of grants made by the National Endowment for the Arts--criticism that I think was totally valid--and some of those specifics the Senator from New Hampshire has illustrated here once again. 
   In 1995, when this debate was at its height, the proponents of the arts severely restricted the ability of the National Endowment for the Arts to make individual grants, and many of these highly criticized expenditures were to individuals rather than to groups and organizations. Overwhelmingly, today, money for the National Endowment for the Arts goes to States' arts agencies and through grants to a wide range of cultural institutions, many of them, fortunately--more than was the case in the past, though perhaps not quite enough--to organizations in the smaller communities of the United States, outside of major metropolitan areas, either to bring various forms of music, dance, theater, the visual arts to those smaller communities, or to support the creation of such art in those communities in a way that I think is highly enthusiastic. And it becomes increasingly difficult for the critics of the Endowment to say that the moneys we appropriate here are used on matters that are not artistic or are totally and completely inappropriate. 
   The present Chairman of the Endowment and the predecessor Chairman of the Endowment have worked diligently and, I think, quite successfully in seeing to it that that was not the case. We created congressional nonvoting members of the National Endowment. The Senator from Alabama, who is one of those members, is here on the floor. He has expressed to me his frustration frequently with the way in which some of his advice 
   has been ignored. But I think his very presence has a salutary effect on the way in which the Endowment is managed. 
   As a consequence, there was a bitter division between the Senate and the House of Representatives in which the House, on at least one occasion--and I think two--did defund the National Endowment and it was rejected by a substantial majority in the Senate. This year, it has disappeared. The House of Representatives has funded the Endowment. If my memory of the bill is correct, there is only a $1 million, or 1-percent, difference between this bill and the bill that passed the House of Representatives. 
   For me, perhaps the most significant and weighty argument in favor of this appropriation is an argument I have made on behalf of a number of other programs that involve partnerships among the Congress of the United States, State governments, and the private sector. That is the fact that I do not believe there is a single arts group or institution in the United States of America that receives all of its funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   As a matter of fact, there may not be any that receives 10 percent of the amount of money that they spend from the National Endowment for the Arts. Overwhelmingly, its grants are modest in amount. They are sought eagerly by far more applicants than can possibly receive those grants, because the very fact that the National Endowment for the Arts has given $20,000, or $30,000, or $100,000 to a particular organization adds a degree of prestige and imprimatur to the activities of that organization that make its efforts to secure private funding--and in almost every case, the great majority of the funding of these organizations comes from the private sector--makes securing that funding easier. Whether it is right or not, contributors seem far more likely to contribute to an organization that has been recognized by the National Endowment for the Arts than they are willing to do so with respect to the thousands of other arts organizations and groups that don't receive such funding. 
   So the appropriation here is considerably less than 1 percent of the money in this appropriations bill that goes to the National Endowment for the Arts and multiplied many times over by support from the private sector. This is true in other areas in my bill, and one I am very interested in, funding for the renewal of salmon runs in the State of Washington. We have money here that will go to a foundation that guarantees that it can double or triple the amount of money actually getting into the field for this purpose, instead of taking on something that would otherwise be wholly and completely a responsibility of the Government of the United States. 
   So, Mr. President, I believe the serious debate over the future of the National Endowment for the Arts has passed. I think it has passed because the National Endowment is reformed. I think it has passed because they are now doing what I believe the Endowment was originally intended to do, and doing it in almost every case with a remarkable degree of thoughtfulness and good sense. What we come up with here, representing only a tiny percent of what goes in the arts activities in the States, is nevertheless very important in that support and vitally important in securing the private sector support for the arts, and that has been in the past and will be in the future a primary source of the money. 
   Regrettably, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire in this connection. If he wishes to speak again, I am going to yield the floor now. I note the presence of the Senators from Florida and Wyoming, and I know the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, wants to speak on this issue. So we are not going to bring it to a vote now. When the Senator from New Hampshire has made his comments, I will ask unanimous consent to go on to the next amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Committee for its efforts to help resolve several very important and contentious issues affecting the Howard Hanson Dam project in Washington state. 
   I applaud the Howard Hanson provision in the Managers Statement accompanying this legislation, which recognizes the ongoing negotiations between the Corps of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service with respect to the Corps' responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act for the protection of threatened Puget Sound Chinook Salmon. These fish runs are directly impacted by the Corps of Engineers' operation of Howard Hanson Dam and, as a consequence, the Corps will be asked to bear responsibility for these impacts under the ESA. 
   I appreciate the Committee's acknowledgment that the requirements of ESA might force a revision of the cost allocation for the Howard Hanson project. Given the urgent need to have mitigation measures in place as soon as possible to protect salmon runs in the Puget Sound region, is it the Committee's intent that the Corps provide a proposal for a cost reallocation to the Committee for consideration in the Water Resources Development Act for the year 2000?

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to express disappointment in the way this tax legislation takes a piecemeal approach toward electricity issues. It deals with only one of the three major provisions that need revision if this industry is going to meet the requirements of all citizens and ratepayers in an era of emerging competition. 
   The electricity industry is in transition. Wholesale competition between utilities and suppliers is becoming a vibrant and competitive market, although there is still work to be done to make this market work more effectively. Consumers have benefited from lower prices and increased supply although the benefits have been invisible to many retail consumers. And nearly half of the states have moved to develop their retail electricity markets to give more consumers the chance to shop for their power provider. 
   But the federal tax provisions that affect this industry were written for a monopoly era. This has the real effect of keeping many utilities from participating in competitive markets due to the penalties they would incur solely because of outdated tax provisions. If these utilities are somehow forced to respond to competition without the needed changes, rates would rise only because of laws written for a time before competition was imagined. 
   This bill addresses only one of these tax problems, the taxation of nuclear plant decommissioning funds. This benefits the investor-owned utilities interested in buying or selling nuclear plants. Two other areas need to be addressed to prevent other consumers from being penalized: the private use restrictions on municipal and public power systems, and the restrictions on electric cooperatives when costs or revenues are incurred during the transition to more extensive competition. 
   In my state we have a healthy mix of suppliers of electricity: investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and public utility districts. These three major sectors of the industry should have their tax problems addressed at the same time. 
   I hope Chairman ROTH and Chairman MURKOWSKI will keep their commitment to hold a hearing in the tax-writing committee in September, with an eye toward resolving these tax issues as expeditiously as possible.

   I had expected that we would have a vote on a point of order with respect to the section of the bill to which he refers tonight. He prefers, as is his right, to introduce a motion to strike this particular provision. That is, of course, a debatable motion and a motion that would be debated with some seriousness. 
   The majority leader has said the floor is available to debate amendments tonight with the exception of the Senator from Virginia. 
   I don't see anyone here who I believe really wants to introduce and debate an amendment tonight. We will leave a resolution or any recorded vote until Wednesday, September 8. 
   One Senator, Mr. SMITH from Oregon, I know, wishes to debate the Senator from Virginia. If we can find him in the next 5 minutes or so, so that there could be a real debate, then I would be delighted to have the Senator from Virginia introduce his amendment. But I think we ought to have someone on both sides here in order to do it. 
   In the meantime, for a few minutes at least, we are searching around to see if there are any agreed-upon amendments that I can simply introduce and have offered and passed. 
   I also notice the presence of the Senator from Wyoming who waited patiently this morning with the Senator from Florida for a debate on a particular amendment which might possibly end up being determined by a voice vote.

The report accompanying S. 1292, Senate Report 106-99, stresses the concern of the Committee that the research program of the Forest Service has lost its focus on its primary mission--forest health and productivity--and directs the Forest Service to reduce those areas not directly related to enhancing forest and rangeland productivity. There are existing research programs outside the agency that have greater expertise and objectivity than the Forest Service; especially beyond the disciplines of forest health and productivity.

   Mr. GORTON. Your point is well taken, and I welcome the opportunity to provide additional information. The expectations of the Committee are that the Forest Service will not provide any increased funding for activities not expressly stated as increases in Senate Report 106-99. In other words, the Committee has not provided any increased funding for the climate change technology initiative or for global climate research. Nor has the Committee provided any increased funding in this account for Forest Service research on invasive species, fire science, watershed science, inventory and monitoring, or recreation, wilderness and social science. The Committee also has denied any increases for fish and wildlife habitat research programs, for the application of mathematical programming and computer simulation tools in national forest planning, and for forest health monitoring research. 
   Beyond disallowing any of these increases, the Committee expects reductions in research funding to be targeted in those research areas that are not directly related to its core mission of forest health and productivity. In addition to social science and recreation research, which are well outside the expertise and core mission of the Forest Service, research not directly related to forest health and productivity includes, but is not limited to, research on wildlife, fish, water, and air sciences; global climate change and wilderness research. Beyond these research areas, other funding projects that the Committee feels are appropriate for reductions include the administrative costs of the Washington office (funded at $11.261 million in fiscal year 1999) and support for so-called ``national commitments'' (funded at $5.744 million in fiscal year 1999).

   Mr. GORTON. What is the regulation the MMS used to assess this fee? 
   Senator WARNER. There is only a guidance document, which was drafted in October 1997 by the MMS under the title ``Proposed Policy and Guidelines on Fees for Outer Continental Shelf Resources Used in Shore Protection and Restoration Projects''. There have been no further rules promulgated since that time, and the City of Virginia Beach is the first public body and only public body to be assessed this fee subsequent to the issues of the ``Proposed Policy''.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year, we enacted the Intestate 90 Land Exchange Act authorizing a large land exchange in Washington between Plum Creek Timber Company and the Forest Service. The land exchange was scheduled under the Act to be closed on July 19. Just prior to closure, however, Plum Creek discovered Marbled Murrelets on two sections of Forest Service land scheduled under the Act to be transferred to Plum Creek. 
   The discovery of Marbled Murrelets occurred after the appraisal was completed and signed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Plum Creek and the Forest Service agree the two sections of land containing murrelets should remain in federal ownership. The legislation, however, did not contemplate or provide for the deletion of these lands or for the need to adjust the appraisal after it had been approved by the Secretary. We are working with the Forest Service and Plum Creek on a solution to this problem. 
   The land exchange is vital because it substantially resolves a decades old conflict created by the checkerboard ownership pattern in central Washington. It places into public ownership thousands of acres of mature timber and essential wildlife habitat, dozens of miles of streams and riparian corridors and some of the most popular recreational lands in Washington.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we approach the August recess, my constituents at Microsoft face the task of battling the Department of Justice, DoJ, as well as their competitors in the courts, while continuing to run one of the most successful companies in one of the most competitive industries in American history. I would like to share some interesting developments that have arisen since I last took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to speak to this issue. 
   Specifically, USA Today recently reported that the Department of Justice is inquiring as to how a possible breakup of Microsoft could be implemented. According to USA Today, unnamed senior officials at DoJ have requested a complex study, which would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, to assess where Microsoft's logical breakup points would be. 
   Mr. President, this seems to be putting the cart before the horse. I would hope that the Department of Justice has more important things on which to spend the taxpayers' money. If not, I am aware of several programs included in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill that could use additional funding. 
   To put the premature nature of this action in perspective, the findings of fact that summarize the points that each side made during the testimony aren't even due until next week. After Judge Penfield Jackson has had an opportunity to review these documents, the two sides will present closing arguments. Following the closing arguments, Judge Jackson will issue his ``proposed findings of fact.'' In response, the government and Microsoft will prepare another set of legal briefs to argue how antitrust law applies to the facts. Judge Jackson then will hear additional courtroom arguments, and finally issue his ``conclusions of law'' around November. 
   Should Judge Jackson rule against Microsoft, a verdict with which I would vehemently disagree, another set of hearings on possible ``remedies'' would need to be held. Those proceedings could last several weeks and involve additional witnesses, which would put a final decision off until sometime next spring. Microsoft almost certainly would appeal its case to U.S. Court of Appeals and possibly all the way to the Supreme Court--pushing the time frame out another two years. 
   Although the timing of this DoJ action is premature, the most intriguing aspect of the July 29, 1999 USA Today article was that the two investment banking firms approached by the DoJ to study the breakup of Microsoft declined the invitation. According to the story, both firms were ``worried about the impact of siding with a Justice Department that they say is viewed in the business community as interventionist.'' If Microsoft were a monopoly, and stifling growth in the Information Technology sector, it seems to me that these technology investment banks would have jumped at the chance to downsize Microsoft in order to open the market to competition, therefore increasing investment opportunities. This is obviously not the case. 
   Far from being guilty of the charges levied against it, Microsoft is actually winning cases brought by other firms charging anti-competitive behavior. Connecticut-based Bristol Technology Inc., which manufactures a software tool called Wind/U, filed a federal antitrust suit against Microsoft on August 18, 1998. Bristol accused Microsoft of ``refusing to deal'' because Microsoft wouldn't license the source code for Windows NT 4 under Bristol's proposed more favorable terms. Despite never having made more than $1.5 million in net profits in their best year, Bristol was seeking up to $270 million in monetary damages. 
   Not unlike the suit brought by the DoJ against Microsoft, the Bristol 
   case seemed to be driven more by those trying to gain competitive advantage than by violation of antitrust law. Bristol hired a Public Relations firm to set out its ``David vs. Goliath'' PR campaign while supposedly negotiating in good faith with Microsoft. A member of Bristol's Board of Directors went so far as to send an email to the CEO and senior management discussing what Bristol was then referring to as the ``we-sue-Microsoft-for-money business plan,'' which he proposed might be funded by Microsoft competitors. 
   I see it as a disturbing trend to have litigation used as a get rich quick scheme instead of protecting ordinary citizens from harm. It is particularly disturbing that the United States government aids and abets this distortion of the American legal system. The insistence of the Department of Justice on continuing its case, in the face of overwhelming evidence that consumers have not been harmed, not to mention that the industry is booming, sets a poor precedent for Americans to follow and can only serve to encourage this behavior. 
   Fortunately, Bristol's hometown jury took less than two days to return a unanimous verdict. Every one of the antitrust charges were dismissed. 
   As gratifying as the jurors' common-sense decision was in the Bristol case, they did find against Microsoft on one count--and awarded Bristol one dollar in damages. Mr. President [pull out dollar bill?], I would suggest that the Bristol jurors got it exactly right. In fact, I think that's a pretty good precedent to follow in the DOJ case: assess Microsoft one dollar per indecorous email submitted by government lawyers as ``evidence'' and maybe the total will be a few hundred dollars or so. That wouldn't really give taxpayers much of a return on the estimated $30 to $60 million dollars this lawsuit has cost them, but no matter: what's a few million taxpayer dollars in the pursuit of that most critical of federal mandates, enforcing corporate etiquette? 
   Mr. President, I ask that an article from the August 5th Investor's Business Daily addressing this issue be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD after my remarks.

   Mr. GORTON. Another interesting development that has arisen since my last speech is the controversy regarding instant messaging technology. Instant messaging, which allows people to chat in real-time with a select list of agreed-upon users, has become the hottest new on-line application. With over 100 million users, instant messaging shows how the Internet is changing the dynamic of the Information Technology industry. 
   Let me give you a brief description of the controversy. AOL, Microsoft, Prodigy, and Yahoo all have developed competing instant messaging technology. Unfortunately, users of these competing versions could not communicate with each other until Microsoft, Prodigy, and Yahoo released versions of this technology that allow their users to talk to AOL users. AOL responded by shutting out the competition and complaining that the competing technology was the equivalent of hacking into the AOL system. This is the equivalent of MCI and Sprint users not being able to place long distance calls to one another. 
   Over the last two weeks, AOL and Microsoft have been engaged in a duck and parry routine over the ability of competing technologies to access AOL users, with Microsoft creating new versions as fast as AOL could block them. I hope that the two sides can come to an agreement soon on the development of an industry standard which will allow for open competition in the marketplace. 
   With AOL having a 20-1 advantage over the nearest rival in the field, they must hope that Milton Friedman's admonition regarding the ``suicidal tendencies'' of some in the industry in supporting the DOJ's intervention doesn't prove prophetic. I hope that the Justice Department does not feel the  need to get involved. This industry, which is changing and advancing so rapidly, doesn't need the government to lay down speed bumps in the road. The federal government should be fostering growth and monitoring the progress, allowing the smooth flow of the traffic of commerce to continue unimpeded. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a recent Wall Street Journal article in the RECORD that illustrates many of the points I have made regarding the absurdity of the DoJ's case against Microsoft. Once again, I implore my colleagues to join me in denouncing this folly.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to congratulate Andrew Rotherham on his new position in the White House as the Special Assistant to the President for Education Policy. Mr. Rotherham was formerly the director of the 21st Century Schools Project at the Progressive Policy Institute, the think tank of the Democratic Leadership Council. Mr. Rotherham has in the past worked closely with my staff on education issues, and I want to wish him success in his new endeavor. 
   Mr. Rotherham's appointment also may create an opportunity for the Administration to reform its positions on education. Recently, the House passed the Teacher Empowerment Act in a bipartisan fashion, 239-185. I had the opportunity to participate in a press conference earlier this week at which Senator GREGG unveiled a slightly different Senate version of the Teacher Empowerment Act. Unfortunately, the President has signaled his intention to veto this legislation because it does not explicitly authorize his Class Size Reduction program. I recommend and hope that the President will learn what Mr. Rotherham has said recently about that proposal. 
   In his position at the Progressive Policy Institute, Mr. Rotherham wrote Toward Performance-Based Federal Education Funding--Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a policy paper that in part touched on the merits of the President's class size reduction program and the issue of local control of education decisions. In a section of this paper entitled Teacher Quality, Class Size, and Student Achievement, he has this to say about the class size reduction program,   
   Now a part of Title VI of ESEA, President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's obsession with means at the expense of results and also the triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising student achievement is reasonable and essential; however, mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington in local affairs.  
   Mr. Rotherham goes on to state,  
   During the debate on the Clinton class-size proposal, it was correctly pointed out that research indicates that teacher quality is a more important variable in student achievement than class size. In fact, this crucial finding was even buried in the U.S. Department of Education's own literature on the issue. The Committee on the Prevention of Reading Difficulty in Young Children stated, ``[Although] the quantity and quality of teacher-student interactions are necessarily limited by large class size, best instructional practices are not guaranteed by small class size.'' In fact, one study of 1000 school districts found that every dollar spent on more highly qualified teachers ``netted greater improvements in student achievement than did any other use of school resources.'' Yet despite this, the class-size initiative allows only 15 percent of the $1.2 billion appropriation to be spent on professional development. Instead of allowing states and localities flexibility to address their own particular circumstances, Washington created a one-size-fits all approach.  
   Mr. Rotherham ends this section of the paper by asking the following insightful question,  
   Considering the crucial importance of teacher quality, the current shortage of qualified teachers, and the fact that class-size is not a universal problem throughout the country, shouldn't states and localities have the option of using more than 15 percent of this funding on professional development?  
   I am hopeful that Mr. Rotherham will prevail upon President Clinton to work with Congress to pass education reform legislation that allows states and local communities the flexibility they need to provide a quality education for all children, while ensuring that they are held accountable for the results of the education they provide. As Mr. Rotherham states, the federal government should not concentrate on ``..... means at the expense of results .....'', and should not allow ``..... the triumph of symbolism over sound policy,'' which the President's class size reduction program represents. 
   My best wishes go out to Mr. Rotherham, and it is my sincere hope that he will be able to have some influence with this administration and that he is able to convince them that Washington does not know best. It's time we put children first, and change the emphasis of the federal government from process and paperwork to kids and learning. 
   I ask to print in the RECORD the section from Mr. Rotherham's report that discusses his views on the administration's class size initiative.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like many in the Nation, Washington's agriculture communities have fallen on extremely tough times. For example, a combination of adverse economic circumstances has caused apple prices to fall to their lowest level in over a decade, while the price for soft winter wheat has plummeted to below $2.50 a bushel. 
   During the debate on the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill, we have been discussing what to most growers is in the forefront of their mind--their bankbook and their bottom line. Without question, this issue deserves our time and attention. 
   While crumbling commodity prices have taken their toll on far too many proud and previously profitable agricultural producers and their families, they also are eroding the very foundation upon which much of my State's rural economy is built. Simply put, many of my state's farmers and their communities are suffering. 
   Washington State produces half the Nation's apples from orchards that start at the base of the Cascade mountains and stretch from the Canadian border in the north, to the Columbia River in the south. Aided by volcanic soil rich in nutrients, irrigation, cool nights and warm sunny days, Washington's apples are the envy of the world's other apple producing countries. 
   Where my State's apple orchards end, Washington's lush fields of wheat begin. Spanning the eastern third of my State, Washington's wheat farms produce the most sought after wheat in Asia. And yet, being the best and producing such high quality products does not always equate to success. 
   The Asian financial crisis and world wide overproduction have taken their toll on Washington's wheat farmers. At the same time, a record crop coupled with a decline in export opportunities and a flood of cheap apple-juice concentrate imports from China have imperiled many of my State's apple growers. 
   Still, Washington's agricultural producers are fiercely independent and not ones to look for a handout from the Federal Government. Rather, in all my discussions with members Washington's agricultural community and its leaders, what I am told my State's farmers need and want most from the Federal Government is a fair shake. Specifically, their list of demands includes trade, access to the tools necessary for quality production, regulatory relief, tax relief a dependable labor force, and Federal participation in agriculture research. 
   Growers have rightfully insisted upon fair and unfettered access to the world's consumers, which can only be achieved by insisting that there will be no trade deals until an acceptable agricultural agreement is reached during the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations slated to commence this fall in Seattle. I thoroughly support this demand, recognizing that Washington's producers export more than 25 percent of their harvest, with at least one third of the apples grown in Washington being shipped, and nine in ten bushels of wheat being exported. 
   Unfortunately, far too many countries still restrict or prohibit the importation of Washington's cornucopia of commodities. That is why I have expressed to administration trade officials the importance and significance of agriculture negotiations during the Ministerial. We must work to pry open these markets and, if need be, deny another country's goods access to our market until the doors of trade swing freely in both directions. 
   For example, just recently the Government of Taiwan agreed to delay implementation of pesticide tolerance tests that would have seriously hampered the U.S. apple and cherry trade with that country. Recognizing Taiwan is the apple industry's largest export market, I took the lead among my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that these tests would not be implemented until further scientific discovery had occurred. 
   Farmers face not only bogus phytosanitary trade barriers, but unfair trade practices by other countries. In early June, I sent a letter of support to the International Trade Commission regarding the dumping case brought by the U.S. apple industry against China. The ITC recently unanimously agreed that dumping had occurred and will announce potential duties in the near future. The case brought by the industry was terribly justified, recognizing the price paid for U.S. apples for juice concentrate plummeted to nearly a penny a pound. 
   Unilateral trade sanctions, as a result of the convincing messages sent by Washington farmers, have been at the center of nearly every agriculture discussion in the U.S. Senate. In response to the cries for relief from farmers, I have supported nearly every agriculture trade sanctions relief bill that has been introduced in the Senate. With nearly 60% of the world's population under U.S. sanction, the time to discuss the impact of these sanctions on the American family farm could not be more timely. It is without question that these sanctions do more harm to our agriculture communities than to the regimes on which they are imposed.  
   In addition to all the various trade conditions facing the producer, farmers in Washington have also demanded access to affordable and effective crop protection tools, which can only be achieved through science-based implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act. That's why I am an original cosponsor of the Regulatory Openness and Fairness Act to ensure that decisions regarding health risks are informed and not hasty, that the intent of the FQPA is carried out with the use of sound science and practical application, that a dose of common sense is applied, and that adequate time is available to make certain all decisions and tolerance standards are healthy and equitable. 
   Continued availability of water for irrigation, electrical generation and the transportation of bulk commodities from field to port, which can only be achieved through a balanced and scientifically-sound salmon recovery effort in the Pacific Northwest is a demand that resinates throughout Washington's orchards and fields. This is a demand I not only respect, but as most producers will know, continues to be one of my most important priorities as a U.S. Senator. I have gone to great lengths to ensure the solvency of the Snake and Columbia River hydroelectric systems with one key user in mind--farmers. 
   Washington produces a wide array of minor crops, many that are very labor intensive and require special attention during harvest. Washington's agriculture community demands a dependable and legal workforce to harvest and process their crops, which can only be achieved by reforming the H2A labor program to provide agricultural employers with an affordable and workable system for securing temporary foreign labor. I have testified with my colleagues and introduced bills in the Senate that would provide such reforms. 
   Farmers in Washington demand meaningful tax relief. Just last week, the tax bill passed in the Senate included the much sought after Farm and Ranch Risk Management accounts. These set-aside accounts will provide the savings mechanism growers have requested in order to secure financial longevity. In addition, I am a strong proponent for the elimination of the estate tax, one the most onerous financial burdens placed on a livelihood that is passed from generation to generation. 
   And finally, with passage of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, growers demanded federal participation in agriculture research. My role as a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee provides the mechanism necessary to ensure that the Pacific Northwest is adequately represented, and that science based research is utilized to assist growers in producing some of the most demanded, nutritional, and safest food supplies in the world. 
   All of the aforementioned demands are intended to provide Washington's agricultural producers the tools they need to cultivate a profitable future. I remain convinced of their merit and committed to the task of securing their achievement. Unfortunately, this administration has yet to recognize their importance and, in most cases, actually opposes their adoption. 
   And now the Senate is in the midst of a debate not only over the livelihood and longevity of the American farm, but to some extent, the policy that drives our nation's combines and tractors. I am unwilling to condone the approach being advocated by some of my colleagues, who are seeking to turn back the hands of time and to undermine the free-market principles embodies in the Freedom to Farm Act. Instead, I support an approach that provides the resources to those programs already in place to assist producers to overcome these difficult times. 
   Meanwhile, as the Senate debates the issue of farm economy and financial assistance, the White House remains silent. Recognizing the bottom line for many in the agriculture sector is slowly dropping, my colleagues and I sent a letter to the President, requesting his active participation in the establishment of a financial relief package for farmers. This letter was in addition to a request included in the fiscal year 1999 supplemental appropriations bill for administration involvement. As we debate this sensitive issue today, the Administration's inactivity and silence is deafening. 
   Recognizing the bleak financial future facing Washington's minor crops, I have during the past few days fought tirelessly to ensure that funding is provided in the Republican farm assistance package for fruits and vegetables. I have undertaken this endeavor very seriously and have engaged in extremely frank discussions with my colleagues over my support for an amendment that includes such a provision. 
   During the debate on the original Cochran financial relief package, I was successful in negotiating the inclusion of $50 million for the fruit and vegetable industries. Because of my desire to provide additional funds for fruits and vegetables, I worked with Senator Roberts to include in his amendment $300 million for specialty crops. While the entire Roberts amendment failed in the Senate, I am pleased that our tree fruit and vegetable industries have a $50 million starting point. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I will have the opportunity to work to increase this funding during conference on the bill. 
   I also responded to the calls for assistance from those in orchard country by including an amendment in the bill directing the Farm Service Agency to review all programs that assist apple growers in time of need. Specifically, I requested that FSA review the limits placed on operating loans utilized by apple farmers, and report back to Congress what the agency perceives is a workable remedy. 
   Rest assured, whatever the final outcome of the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill, I will send two important messages to my agriculture constituency back home. First, I will continue working tirelessly to make certain all commodities produced from Washington's fertile soil will have a fair shake at receiving some form of assistance. I am poised and prepared to continue this challenge. And second, I will continue working on agriculture's list of demands, pushing to ensure that from trade to labor, and from taxes to environment, the livelihood that has made agriculture the career choice for so many will remain just that.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce the Take Pride in America Volunteer Recognition Act of 1999, legislation which will revitalize and expand an important program created in the 1980's to enhance the legacy of the Great Outdoors. 
   Each American is part owner of an incredible asset--millions and millions of acres of national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges and other public lands. These wonderful places are part of the legacy each of us shares, whether we live in my state of Washington or on the other side of the nation. We visit these places often and for a variety of reasons. Together, federal lands attract nearly two billion visits annually. Americas' Great Outdoors is a place for active fun--for skiing and fishing, camping and  whitewatersports--as well as for quite time away from our cities, jobs and commutes. 
   Years ago, an important initiative was launched to encourage Americans to enjoy this legacy, and take responsibility for protecting it for future generations. The program was called Take Pride in America and had three components. The first portion was a public awareness campaign, designed to emphasize the importance of caring for federal lands and water. The second portion was an environmental education program for school children and for visitors to public lands. The third portion was a volunteer recruitment and recognition effort. 
   The Take Pride in America program received the support of a great number of well-known Americans. Public Service Announcements and appearances were contributed by Clint Eastwood and Linda Evans, Lou Gossett and Charles Bronson, Gerald McRainey and even ALF. The Oak Ridge Boys wrote and recorded to Take Pride in America theme song, and donated all royalties to the program. Forty-seven governors initiated Take Pride programs within their states, recognizing outstanding volunteers ranging from young children to seniors. Volunteers from across the nation came to Washington for an annual national recognition event at the White House and similar prominent locations. The Ad Council obtained professional support for the program and donated placements for PSA's--in fact, some of the elements of this campaign continue to run. 
   The results were good. Volunteerism for America's Great Outdoors surged and vandalism decline. Agencies such as the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service and the Corps of Engineers were given a new tool to recruit and recognize Americans who invested their time and energy into enhancing our shared wealth of parks and forests. 
   Other priorities have put the Take Pride in America Program on hold in recent years. It is time to take this tool out and put it to good use once again. 
   Our public lands have maintenance and enhancement needs that exceed our ability to fund through general appropriations. We are now experimenting with new recreation fees and other mechanisms to attack a deferred maintenance backlog amounting to more than one billion dollars. 
   My legislation would restore and expand the program created by Congress in 1990, recommitting us to all three parts of the original program. It would also strengthen the program to reflect a special opportunity associated with the National Fee Demonstration Program created in 1996, which provides nearly $200 million annually in additional resources to four key federal land systems. The legislation would strengthen our volunteer programs in several ways, including the establishment of a special pass to recognize volunteers who serve 50 hours or more on federal public lands. 
   In my state, the Forest Service has done a tremendous job of organizing and utilizing the skills and enthusiasm of volunteers committed to improving our forests. The volunteer programs in the Northwest vary from forest to forest. Typically, groups like the Student Conservation Association, Mountaineers, Mazamas, and Backcountry Horsemen of Washington contract with the National Forest Service to complete specific projects designed to improve the health of the forests and enhance recreational opportunities. Individuals within these associations can earn passes for free access at national forest trailheads in the Pacific Northwest. I think this program is outstanding, and I want the Forest Service to continue accommodating and encouraging the efforts of volunteers. This bill is designed to encore these types of volunteer programs in other regions of the National Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, I want to recognize the special efforts of volunteers who contribute over 50 hours of work on federal lands. The legislation directs the Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture to recognize these individuals with a pass to recreation areas throughout the federal system. 
   I look forward to exploring appropriate means for recognition of volunteers as this legislation is considered in the hearing process. We need to consider carefully the relationship between the special Take Pride in America Pass and other passes, including the Golden Eagle and Golden Age passes. 
   This legislation also will serve as a catalyst for expanding the scope of volunteer programs on federal lands. Too often in the past, our expectations for volunteer projects have focused on projects requiring shovels or paint brushes and requiring high levels of physical exertion. The truth is that important volunteer projects that can protect and enhance America's Great Outdoors are far more diverse. We need skills senior Americans have developed during a lifetime of living and learning, from research in libraries to teaching. We need those with special talents and gifts, from architects to web page designers, from attorneys--yes, even attorneys--to masons. We need to have meaningful projects for those with just a few hours to contribute as well as for those who are prepared to make an ongoing commitment of their time. Some of the projects can even be undertaken off-site. We need a good directory of needed volunteer undertakings that is widely available long before a volunteer shows up at a forest or park headquarters. 
   To the hundreds of thousands of Americans who already spend time protecting and enhancing America's public lands--covering nearly one in three acres of the nation--I give my thanks and ask for help in devising a system that recognizes the wonderful contribution you make and inspires millions of others to join in your important work. I also ask for the support of the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture for this legislation and its goal of taking better care of America's Great Outdoors.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I began my Innovation in Education Award Program earlier this year, I endeavored to find and recognize programs, schools, and individuals whose work in improving education deserves recognition. The Federal Way School District's Internet Academy is just such a program and one which I am proud to present with my Innovation in Education Award. 
   The Internet Academy is the brain child of recently departed Superintendent Tom Vander Ark, who is widely credited with injecting new life into the Federal Way District. The Academy has a standards-based curriculum that provides a comprehensive course of study designed to meet state guidelines and instructional objectives. What is innovative, however, is the way in which the Academy engages students under the continuous guidance of state accredited teachers. The Academy offers a full range of courses for school credit, via the Internet, for grades K-12. The program was created only 3 years ago as a pilot K-8 program and has expanded significantly since then. In June of 1998 it had 65 enrollees--by June of 1999 it had expanded to over 800. 
   As our society's use of technology has increased, it is important that our public education system keep abreast of such transformation and provide opportunities using technology to encourage student learning. By offering an interactive curriculum that is accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the district's Academy is ensuring that students are given maximum opportunity to access a good education. 
   Today's best instructional technologies can enhance the learning environment by eliminating the time and space boundaries present with the traditional classroom. This alternative learning environment also allows for an increasingly active role for families in the education of our children. It is a common-sense proposition that increased parental involvement promotes a richer educational process. This aspect of learning is especially critical for home-schoolers in search of instruction for specific topics or seeking to tap into the resources of the public education system. 
   The parent of one home-schooled child noted: ``Home-school can be really challenging sometimes. It is great to have a resource like the Internet Academy for my son.'' 
   Meanwhile, a 10th grade student said: ``I like the Internet Academy because I can work at my own pace. The on-line curriculum gives me a better understanding than what I can get in a classroom with 30 other students. The approach allows me to explore areas that interest me while completing the course work.'' 
   I have heard from many educators that they sometimes struggle to maintain the interest and energy of their students. The Federal Way School District, through its Internet Academy, has shown that creative means to keep students engaged in today's multi-media environment are not only possible but, can be highly successful. 
   Our economy, powered in large part by a strong hi-tech sector, has achieved an impressive record of growth in recent months and it stands to reason that creatively injecting hi-tech tools into our education system can have equally rewarding results. I applaud the Federal Way School District's vision in establishing the Internet Academy, I endorse their efforts to ensure that students are given every possible opportunity to access and learn from our public education system. I hope my colleagues will join in my recognizing the Internet Academy's innovative work.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the question now being considered by the Senate is whether we should refund a portion of the federal government surplus to American families. 
   Over the next ten years, the federal government will collect $996 billion more in income and other taxes than is necessary to pay fully for every existing federal program, agency and department. This means that the IRS will be taking almost $1 trillion more in taxes from the American people's paychecks than it needs to operate the government. This is a tax surplus--a tax overpayment. 
   This tax relief debate, serious as it is, concerns only the non-Social Security surplus. Both sides agree that the Social Security surplus itself is to be reserved for Social Security recipients only, and not be diverted to any other purpose. 
   There is, however, an important distinction between the two parties even on Social Security. Republicans, myself included, believe that we should pass a ``lockbox'' law, giving the strongest possible statutory protection to that Social Security surplus. Democrats have consistently filibustered our proposal, asking Americans simply to trust them not to raid the Social Security surplus in the future as they have in the past. That is not enough. 
   The difference between the parties on taxes is even more striking. Republicans believe that the lion's share of the non-Social Security surplus ought to be returned to the American taxpayer whose taxes created that surplus; Democrats want to spend that surplus on new and expanded government programs. 
   I am convinced that this tax overpayment should be refunded to the American people who worked for and earned it. It is their money and it should be returned to them to invest and spend as they deem best for their families and their futures. The alternative to refunding the tax surplus to taxpayers is to leave the money in Washington, DC where it will be spent to create $1 trillion in new government programs. 
   The President and his supporters in Congress are making outrageous claims that giving a refund to taxpayers is risky or even dangerous. They say that somehow returning a portion of the government surplus to  American families will somehow endanger the very livelihoods of women and children. On that point, I would ask every American citizen to challenge the President and his Democratic allies to back up with facts their politically-charged claims. 
   This latest shameless charade by the President is absolutely outrageous. The inference propounded by President Clinton is that those of us in this Chamber who support a tax refund are out to harm women and children, and that those who oppose such a refund care more about women and children than we do. That's an absolute outrage, and I'm truly sorry to see that the President of the United States will stoop to such low levels in order to keep this money here in Washington, D.C. so that he can spend it on new government programs. 
   I will resist the temptation to join the President in his game of scare tactics, but I will take this opportunity to challenge all Americans to ask themselves this question when they hear these ridiculous charges: how will women and children, or anyone else for that matter, possibly be hurt by the government giving them back some of the money they overpaid to Washington, D.C.? 
   To further illustrate the weakness of the President's argument, I'd like everyone watching this on C-Span back home to take three dollars out of his or her purse or wallet. Now imagine that each dollar bill is worth a trillion dollars. That's the surplus--the people's tax overpayment. That's the amount that Americans have overpaid the government in personal income and other taxes. 
   We Republicans want to put two of these dollars aside to protect Social Security and Medicare and other essential programs, and to cut the national debt in half. 
   The debate with the Democrats is over what to do with the third dollar. Republicans want to give it back to the taxpayers who earned it. Democrats want to spend it on new programs and bureaucracies. It's as simple and clear as that. 
   The surplus is generated from personal income and other taxes, it belongs to the American people. It's not the government's money--it's your money . . . you sent it here. Shouldn't you get some of it back? 
   While I strongly support refunding the tax surplus to the taxpaying families and hardworking individuals all across this country, it is my sincere hope that Congress will ultimately pass a bill that reduces the tax burden on Washington state families while moving towards simplification of the federal tax code. 
   Fundamental reform of the tax code is my number one tax priority. I am a strong, committed advocate for the elimination of our current federal tax system. It is too complicated, too burdensome, too unfair. The current system should be scrapped and replaced with one that is much simpler and easier to understand. We need to focus our energy and attention in Congress on developing an alternative. I will support a replacement code that is based on four principles: the new code must be fair, simple, uniform and consistent. Americans deserve a tax code they can understand and predict. 
   A vast majority of the American people and those in Congress support reforming our tax code. I hope that when Congress takes action to ease the cost burden of the federal tax code, the opportunity to simplify or reduce the complexity of the tax code will be seized. I do not pretend to believe there is consensus on how to reform the code completely at this time, but at the very least Congress should pass a tax bill that does not make the code even more of a bewildering mess than it is today. 
   Unfortunately, the bill reported out of the Finance Committee does not achieve the goals of either simplifying the code, or even to do no further harm. The bill contains 15 titles, 19 subtitles and 163 various sections to total over 400 pages in length. It takes a report of an additional almost 300 pages to explain what the bill even does. Yes, the bill does refund nearly $800 billion in unneeded tax dollars back to the American people, but at what price? Adding more pages to the tax code? Making the code more complicated? Further confusing taxpayers as they struggle to fill out their tax returns? 
   What is most unfortunate is that a tax relief bill need not be so complex. It is certainly possible to refund the tax surplus simply and directly. An alternative was proposed during committee consideration by Senator GRAMM that accomplished the goal of simple tax relief by including just four elements: broad-based income tax rate relief, repeal of death taxes, elimination of the marriage penalty, and full deductibility for health insurance for all Americans. I voted for that alternative in the Senate. 
   While I may not fully endorse every aspect of this specific proposal, I strongly and enthusiastically support its intent to refund the taxpayers' money in a manner that simplifies and corrects injustices in the current tax code. We should get rid of death taxes, stop penalizing married couples through the tax code, allow self-employed and individual Americans to fully deduct their health insurance costs just as corporations can, and we should permanently extend the R&D tax credit so that our increasingly technology driven economy can continue to grow and create jobs. 
   I cannot, though, happily endorse a tax relief package that moves toward such reform only to get lost in a 443-page swamp of countless new provisions and rules. The citizens of Washington state and the taxpayers of this nation deserve to have a significant portion of the tax surplus returned to them, and they deserve it in a manner that doesn't make filling out their IRS return by April 15th even more of an exasperating experience. 
   For now, I will continue to push for a debate that reforms our tax code. In the meantime, I am committed to pushing onward with the principles that guide this debate: Should a portion of the government surplus be refunded to American families, or should the rest of the non-Social Security and Medicare surplus be left in Washington, D.C. for increased spending on government programs? 
   On that question, the answer is easy . . . give American families a tax refund. That requires a yes vote, though with serious reservations.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I submit for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a column by Michael Kelly that appeared in the July 28th edition of the Washington Post. Mr. Kelly asks in his column whether it ``strikes anyone as odd'' that the Clinton-Gore Administration continues desperately to hand onto its policy of ``constructive engagement'' with China, even as Beijing breaths fire in response to reasonable statement made by the freely- and fairly-elected President of Republic of China on Taiwan. 
   This Senator, for one, has serious questions about the wisdom of President Clinton's foreign policy as it relates to China, and the competence of the Clinton-Gore Administration to protect and advance America's interest in this vital region of the world. 
   In response to statements by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui that discussions and talks between Taiwan and China should be conducted on a ``special state-to-state'' basis, China has repeatedly issued not-so-veiled threats of its intent to use military force against Taiwan unless President Lee retracts his statements. 
   What was the response of the Clinton-Gore Administration? Let me reference a news story from the July 26th edition of the Washington Post entitled ``Albright, Chinese Foreign Minister Hold `Very Friendly Lunch.' '' The article reads in part,  
   Lee's announcement triggered a ferocious response by Beijing. Washington also criticized it and dispatched a representative to pressure Taiwan to modify its statement. 
   Today, Albright said that Richard Bush, the U.S. envoy to Taiwan, told Lee ``that there needs to be ..... a peaceful resolution to this and a dialogue. And I think that the explanations offered thus far don't quite do it.''  
   Mr. President, this is an amazing as it is outrageous. Rather than defend the Republic of China on Taiwan and its right to live in peace and choose its own form of government, Secretary of State Albright has a ``very friendly lunch'' with one of the highest ranking members of the repressive communist Chinese regime while one of her assistants reprimands and pressures Taiwan to appease China. Can it truly be our nation's policy is to protect China from Taiwan? 
   Taiwan is not the bully in this matter. Taiwan deserves America's commitment to defend it against China's threats. Our nation should proudly and firmly stand by Taiwan, a blooming and prosperous democracy where free speech, religious freedom and the benefits of capitalism are practiced and enjoyed. The United States should stand in the future, as it has in the past, for freedom and democracy whenever those great qualities are threatened by the forces of repression.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to signify my support for the introduction of the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999. 
   According to data compiled in the last five years, the State of Washington produces more than 230 food, feed and seed crops; ranks in the top five for the value of the commodities produced; leads the nation in the production of apples, spearmint oil, red raspberries, hops, edible peas and lentils, asparagus, sweet cherries, and  pears; is second in the nation in the production of winter wheat, potatoes, Concord grapes, and carrots; and contributes more than $5 billion to the State's economy annually. Not only do all these facts signify the importance of the agriculture industry to the State of Washington and the nation, but highlight the importance of having the proper tools and chemicals necessary to produce one of the most abundant, economical, and safest food supplies in the world. 
   I agreed to be an original cosponsor the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999 for many reasons, but the most significant reason comes down to common sense. I supported the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act in 1996 and still believe in the intent of the legislation. However, recent accounts from the agriculture industry cite concern about the practical application of reliable data and science to the process. 
   Just this week a 25-year-old apple farmer from Orondo, Washington visited my office to voice her concerns over the implementation of FQPA. Karen Simmons explained that with the current manner in which FQPA is being implemented, entire classes of pesticides are threatened with elimination. Should these tools of agriculture be lost, an orchard like Karen's faces possible extinction. Karen's story is not the first I've heard, as farmers from Washington have been invaluable in expressing their concerns to me over the future of their livliood. 
   Karen's account mimics the thousands of reports my colleagues and I have heard from growers across this country. Karen, like many farmers, never follows the application suggestions prescribed by the chemicals she uses. Not only does she not follow these recommendations for practical purposes, but because of the cost incurred as well. 
   For example, one of the pesticides she utilizes recommends application up to twice a week, but Karen informed us that she rarely uses it that frequently. While Karen might not utilize this chemical often, it is imperative that she has it as a tool. Should this tool be eliminated altogether, Karen's crop is susceptible to infestation, thereby putting her entire orchard in jeopardy. 
   Unfortunately, in establishing the risk cup for chemicals, EPA has been using application recommendations, often referred to as default assumptions, and not taking into consideration actual usage. This approach is threatening the tools growers have at their disposal. That is why it is imperative that we incorporate into the implementation of FQPA a rulemaking process, allowing growers, chemical utilizers, and household pest producers the ability to divulge actual usage and to apply practical sense to the process. How could we suggest threatening the livelihood of the American farmer and others, while not providing for them an avenue to participate, comment and clarify? 
   Children's health is equally important, and, as several of my colleagues have suggested, improper application of the FQPA to household pest controls could create a host of health hazards for children and the elderly. For example, there is a real threat that current FQPA implementation could eliminate the use of some household insecticides and repellants. As many of you know, children and the elderly are susceptible to disease, often carried by cockroaches and other insects. Improper control of these pests could equate to serious health hazards across the nation, a scenario none of us predicted with the passage of FQPA. 
   Again, I stress that the intent of the legislation is not to alter the importance or significance of human health, but to ensure that decisions regarding health risks are informed and not hasty, that the intent of the FQPA is carried out with the use of sound science and practical application, that a dose of common sense is applied, and that adequate time is available to make certain all decisions and tolerance standards are healthy and equitable. 
   Without question, the United States produces the most abundant, desirable, inexpensive, and safest food supplies in the world. The FQPA must be implemented in a fashion that not only takes into account these very facts, but continues to consider the needs, choices and health of the American consumer. 
   I thank my colleagues for their continuing interest in this issue, and look forward to working with everyone to pass the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senators from the Northwest are sometimes frustrated in trying to get our message across, to deliver or reflect the views of our constituencies almost 3,000 miles away, and to let our Senate colleagues from around this country understand what it's like to live in the Northwest. 
   The Northwest is known for clean air and water, a high quality of life, picturesque landscapes, the beauty and majesty of the Cascade and Olympic Mountains, the rolling hills of the Palouse, lush wooded forests, sparkling lakes, a playground for backpackers, hikers and recreational enthusiasts, home of America's success story--Microsoft, the apple capital of the world, breadbasket to the nation, a vibrant salmon fishery and home of the most wonderful people who possess a zest for life and fierce instinct to preserve and protect these truly unique qualities of my great state of Washington and of Oregon, Idaho, and Montana as well. 
   Mr. President, I share the passion of my constituents. I consider it an honor to represent a state as great and diverse as mine. But what is often overlooked is the fact that our hydroelectric power system plays a central role in keeping Pacific Northwest a clean, healthy, and affordable place to live, work, play, and raise a family. 
   I have come to this floor many times to explain what makes the Northwest tick to my colleagues and to others unfamiliar with the region. And I have been frustrated or puzzled by the reaction I get when I reflect the views of my state, and in particular, my eastern Washington communities. 
   We have been waging a battle with this administration, radical environmental organizations, and other dam removal advocates over the issue of removing Columbia-Snake River dams. 
   Advocates of dismantling our Columbia River hydro system place the choice in stark terms of dams or salmon. That choice, presented in such terms, is false. The truth is that by applying adaptive management to our hydro system, we can and will preserve endangered salmon runs and our valuable hydro system. 
   I reject the false choice of salmon versus the Columbia hydro system. I believe passionately that we can and will restore a vibrant salmon fishery to the Columbia and that we can do so within the confines of the hydro system. 
   To an outsider, one would think the administration has the momentum. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has been a roll--tearing down dams from the California coast to Maine in the Northwest. 
   Incidentally, however, we may be a new ally in Vice President ALBERT GORE. While he has been known as a removal advocate, last week, in order to get a photo opportunity on the Connecticut River, he had a dam release some 4 billion gallons of water in order that he could go cancoeing. Perhaps now we have found a new use for dams and a new ally in the Vice President, as long as we can offer him canoeing activities by releasing water. 
   Most of us in the region believe we have the facts and support on our side to defeat those who wish to remove the Snake River dams and thereby destroy a central piece of the Northwest economy and a way of life for millions of Northwesterners. 
   I have asked myself--What do we have to do? 
   We can have thousands rally to ``Save Our Dams''--as we did in eastern Washington and Oregon communities earlier this year. 
   We can have our local, State, and Federal officials unite in their opposition to dam removal, and we have added Governor Gary Locke and Senator MURRAY to the ranks of those opposed to removing our eastern Washington dams. 
   And we can have scientists, federal agencies, and even environmental groups point to global warming as a major cause for salmon decline. 
   We can have the National Marine Fisheries Service scientists tell us, in a report released April 14, that the chance of recovery for a few distinct salmon runs is only 64 percent if all four lower Snake River dams are removed, as against 53 percent by continuing to transport smolts around the dams--a difference that is barely statistically significant. 
   And we can have recent media reports tell us that the ``Outlook is bright for salmon runs this year.'' In this July 12 Seattle Times article, scientists and biologists are predicting a potential rebound in salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. And the reasons they cite are: improved ocean conditions, better freshwater conditions, and cutbacks in fishing. 
   But still we hear the dam removal clamor from national environmental groups and bureaucrats in the Clinton-Gore administration. And we have an energized Interior Secretary who in his words has been ``out on the landscape over the past few months carrying around a sledgehammer'' giving speeches saying ``dams do, in fact, outlive their function'' and ``despite the history and the current differences over dams, Babbitt said he believes change is inevitable.'' (Trout Unlimited Speech, CQ, July 17, 1999) 
   Here I am again, to share some compelling statistics recently released by the Army Corps of Engineers that further prove that removing dams in eastern Washington would be an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare. 
   Ten days ago, the Corps released three preliminary economic studies that will be included in an overall Lower Snake River Juvenile Fish Migration Feasibility Study set for completion later this year. 
   The Corps studies quantified the economic impact of the removal of the four Snake River dams as removal relates to the region's water supply, navigation, and power production. 
   I simply cannot overstate the importance of these studies and what they mean for the future of the Pacific Northwest, its economy and the livelihood of our families and communities. 
   That is why I was surprised when there was little attention paid to the release of these three studies. I can remember that as recently as March of this year when the Corps was preparing to release a study on recreation benefits involving the four lower Snake River dams, environmental groups including the Sierra Club, NW Sportfishing Industry Association, Trout Unlimited, and Save Our Wild Salmon were tremendously successful in getting the media's attention and substantial coverage of their claims that removing the four Snake River dams would bring a $300 million annual recreational windfall to the region. 
   The environmental groups leaked the $300 million number knowing that the study was incomplete, but the false information made big news. Then, the report was completed and the truth was told. In fact, the real number, according to the Corps report is: ``Under the natural river drawdown alternative, the value of recreation and tourism then increased to $129 million annually, which represents an increase of about $67 million per year.'' 
   Why did this report, with complete analysis, receive so little attention: 
   I am again surprised at the lack of attention given to the results of the latest three studies, which standing alone, send such a clear signal to this administration, radical environmental groups, and dam removal advocates everywhere that they should abandon their cause. 
   Let me share these numbers with you: 
   First, starting with power production: 
   The economic effect of breaching on the region's power supply would be $251 million to $291 million a year. 
   Residential bills for Northwest families and senior citizens would increase $1.50 to $5.30 per month. 
   But the region's industrial power users, which rely on cheap power to provide thousands of jobs can see a monthly increase ranging from $387 to $1,326. Our aluminum companies would see an increase in their monthly bills ranging from $222,000 to $758,000. 
   If the Snake River dams are breached, how would we replace the 1,231 megawatts the dams produce annually? Keep in mind it takes 1,000 megawatts to serve Seattle. The answer is, there is no cheap alternative. We can increase power production at thermal power plants or build new gas-fired combined-combustion turbine plants. 
   Finally, these power estimates wouldn't be complete without reminding my colleagues that last month the Administration sought to collect at least $1 billion beyond normal power costs to create a `slush fund' to fund the removal of the four Snake river dams. I was delighted to pass any amendment prohibiting the Bonneville Power Administration from raising rates on Northwest power customers for a project they don't even want. 
   Second, lets look at irrigation. 
   The Corps report assumes that there is no economically feasible way to continue to provide irrigation to the 37,000 acres of farmland served by the four Snake River dams. The report assumes 37,000 acres of farmland will be taken out of production as a result of breaching those dams. 
   What does this loss of water supply mean for eastern Washington? 
   The loss of irrigated farmland would cost $9.2 million annually. 
   The cost to retrofit municipal and industrial pump stations would be $.8 to 43.8 million a year. 
   The cost to retrofit privately-owned wells would be 43.9 million annually. 
   In light of these sobering statistics, what options would be left for irrigators? The Corps estimated the economic effect on dam breaching on farmland value would amount to more than $134 million. The Corps also considered ways to alter the irrigation system in order to continue to irrigate the 37,000 acres--to accomplish this alternative, we would have to spend more than $291 million--more than the value of the land. Our farmers and agricultural communities are struggling enough as it is, and removing their ability to even water their crops puts them beyond despair. Therefore, the Corps assumes this irrigated farmland will disappear. 
   Lastely, let's look at transportation: 
   The Corps studied transportation impacts of breaching the four Snake river dams. 
   The transportation costs resulting from breaching the four Snake River dams would rise to $1.23 per bushel from .98 cents per bushel--a 24 percent increase. 
   The annual increase in transportation costs to the region would be $40 million for all commodities. 
   Breaching the four dams would remove 3.8 million tons of grain from the Snake River navigation system. Of this 3.8 million, 1.1 million would move to rail transportation and 2.7 million tons would move to truck transportation. 
   According to the report, barge transportation of commodities on the Snake river limits the cost of rail transportation and truck transportation. Removing competition among these types of transportation could drive up costs. According to the report, barge transportation has saved, on average, $5.95 in per ton when compared with other transportation alternatives. ``Disturbing this competition would be one of the most important regional consequences of permanent drawdown.'' 
   According to the Washington State Legislative Transportation Committee, additional costs resulting from road and highway damage range from $56 million to $100.7 million. 
   Further, it is important to note that the navigation system of the Columbia allows enough barge transportation that if it were destroyed, more than 700,000 18-wheelers a year would be added to our already congested state roads and highways to replace the lost hauling capacity. (Source: Pacific Northwest Waterways Association) 
   I want to put all this together and construct a picture for you and what this scenario would mean in eastern Washington. 
   In exchange for breaching or removing the four Snake river dams, here's what the citizens of the Pacific Northwest could get: 
   We would lose four dams that produce hydro-power, which emit no pollutants into the air, for a thermal based power source that would jeopardize the clean air unique to the Northwest and enjoyed by countless residents and visitors to our state. 
   The 37,000 acres of irrigated farmland in Franklin and Walla Walla counties and the hundreds of employees that help supply food to more than a million people would disappear. 
   There is a likelihood that there would be a temporary loss of water for well users after dam breaching due to the inability to alter well depths until the actual removal of dams. 
   The increased truck traffic on our roads to haul wheat and barley to coastal ports will have an adverse effect on air quality and impose an additional financial burden on the family farm, which for many would be too much to bear and force them to give up their land. 
   So what do we get by removing the four Snake River dams? Shattered lives, displaced families and communities who will have seen their livelihoods destroyed, generations of family farmers penniless, industries forced to drive up consumer costs, air pollution, a desert that once bloomed with agriculture products goes dry, a far less competitive Northwest economy and a Northwest scrambling to repay a BPA treasury debt with less revenue, and scrambling to buy or build higher cost polluting sources of power. 
   So according to these three latest studies, the bottom line is that if we breach the four dams to increase our chances of bringing a select number of salmon runs back by only 11%, the Northwest will suffer economic impacts of $299 to $342 million a year in perpetuity. This staggering figure doesn't even include the estimated $1 billion it would take to actually remove the dams. 
   If we remove the Snake river dams, over the next 24 years we only improve our chances of recovering spring and summer chinook to the survival goals set by NMFS by 11 to 30 percent over the current system of barging. Over 24 years, NMFS would like to reach the survival standard of returning 150 to 300 spring and summer chinook to the Snake River tributaries each year. 
   But there is something else that these numbers, studies and data can't quantify: 
   What many outside the region don't understand is that the four dams on the Lower Snake river are part of our life, heritage, and culture. 
   I repeat the call I issued last month to the administration and dam removal advocates: abandon your cause and work with the region on cost-effective salmon recovery measures that can restore salmon runs and preserve our Northwest way of life.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The bill totals $13.924 billion in discretionary budget authority, an amount that is $1.125 billion below the President's budget request and $19 million below the fiscal year 1999 enacted level. The bill fully complies with the spending limits established in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the amount provided is right at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. 
   As is always the case, putting this bill together has been a tremendous challenge. While I am extremely grateful that Senator STEVENS, in consultation with Senator BYRD, was able to provide the subcommittee with an increase over its original 302(b) allocation, the amount contained in this bill is still slightly below the fiscal year 1999 enacted level. I wish to point out to my colleagues, however, that this does not mean that delivery of programs can be continued at the current level simply by holding appropriations even with last year. 
   The programs funded in this appropriations bill are highly personnel-intensive, supporting tens of thousands of park rangers, foresters, and Indian Health Service doctors. As such, mandated pay and benefit increases for Federal personnel and increases in rent charged by the General Services Administration--increases over which the subcommittee has no control--place a significant burden on Interior bill agencies. The committee must choose either to provide funds to cover these costs, or require agencies to absorb them by reducing services or finding more efficient ways of delivering programs. For fiscal year 2000, these fixed costs amount to more than $300 million. While the committee has provided increases to cover a majority of this amount by drawing on carryover balances and reducing low priority programs, some agencies will be forced to absorb a portion of their fixed costs. 
   Given the necessity of funding most fixed costs increases within an allocation that is slightly below the current year level, there is little room in this bill for new programs, increases in existing programs, or additional projects of interest to individual Members. But by terminating low priority programs and making selective reductions in others, we have been able to provide targeted increases for certain high priority programs. 
   The committee has provided a $70 million increase for the operation of the national park system, including $27 million to increase the base operating budgets of 100 park units. This increase is further indication of the Senate's commitment to preserving and enhancing our national park system while remaining within the fiscal constraints of the balanced budget agreement. The Senate bill puts funding for the operation of our parks at a level fully $277 million higher than the fiscal year 1995 level, and 82 percent over the amount provided a decade ago. 
   For the other land management agencies, the bill provides an increase of $27 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service, including more than $13 million for the operation of the national wildlife refuge system. The bill increases the Forest Service operating account by $17 million, including significant increases for recreation management, forest ecosystem restoration, and road maintenance. A $22 million increase is provided for management of lands by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as another $5 million increase for payments in lieu of taxes. The amount provided for PILT reflects a continued effort to steadily increase appropriations for this program without harming the core operating programs funded in this bill. Though appropriations for PILT were stagnant throughout the first half of this decade, the amount provided in this bill represents a 28 percent increase over the amount provided in fiscal year 1995. 
   Among the programs in this bill that are specifically for the benefit of Native Americans, the committee's top priority has been to provide the Secretary of the Interior with the resources necessary to fix the Indian trust fund management system. Indian land and trust fund records have been allowed to deteriorate to a deplorable state, and the Department of the Interior now finds itself scrambling to reconcile thousands upon thousands of trust records that are scattered across the country. Many of these records are located in cardboard boxes that have not been touched for years, or in ancient computer systems that are incompatible with one another. The Department is performing this task under the watchful eye of the court, having been sued by those whose trust accounts it is supposed to be managing. 
   I believe that Secretary Babbitt is making a good faith effort to address this problem, and as such have recommended a funding level for the Office of the Special Trustee that is $39 million over the amount originally provided for fiscal year 1999. This amount will provide for both the manpower and the trust management systems necessary to fix the problem. I will note, however, that the Federal track record in managing large system procurements is spotty at best. As such, I hope to continue to work closely with the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that these funds are expended wisely, and that we will not regret our decision to provide such a considerable amount for this purpose. I plead with my colleagues, however, to refrain from offering amendments to this bill that would radically change the course of action for trust management that has been laid out by the administration. Any such changes should be carefully considered and have the benefit of hearings by the authorizing committees. 
   With regard to other Indian programs, I will quickly note that the bill provides an $83 million increase for the Indian Health Service, as well as significant increases for both Indian law enforcement and Indian school construction and repair. Funding for Indian schools continues to be among the highest programmatic priorities expressed by members of the Interior Subcommittee. 
   The Interior bill also funds a myriad of programs that preserve and enhance our nation's cultural heritage. Perhaps the most visible of these programs are the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. While the subcommittee's allocation did not allow us to increase these accounts by large amounts as would be the desire of many Senators, the bill does provide a $1 million increase for each program. These increases will not allow for any dramatic expansion the Endowments' ongoing programs, but do indicate the committee's general support for the Endowments and the efforts they have made to respond to the various criticisms that have been leveled at them. I hope that we may able to do even better next year. 
   The bill also includes the full $19 million required to complete the Federal commitment to the construction of the National Museum of the American Indian on The Mall, and $20 million to continue phase two of the comprehensive building rehabilitation project at the Kennedy Center. 
   The final grouping of agencies in this bill that I will mention at this time are the energy programs. The bill provides funding for both fossil energy R&D and energy conservation R&D at roughly the current year level. These programs are vital if we hope to stem our increasing dependence on foreign oil, to preserve the country's leadership in the manufacture of energy technologies, and to enable our economy to achieve reductions in energy use and emissions in ways that will not cripple economic growth. The bill also preserves funding for the weatherization and state grant programs at the fiscal year 1999 level. Maintaining current funding levels for these programs is made possible in part by the absence of any new appropriations for the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves, and a deferral of appropriations previously made for the Clean Coal Technology Program. 
   Mr. President, I would like to touch on two more issues that may be of particular interest to members. The first is funding for land acquisition. Many Senators are aware that the President's budget request included some $1 billion for a ``lands legacy'' initiative. This initiative is an amalgamation of programs, some of which the committee has been funding for years, some of which are entirely new. Many of the programs included in the initiative lack authorization entirely. While the committee may well have chosen to provide many of these increases if it were allowed to distribute a $1.1 billion increase in spending, the lands legacy initiative is absurd in the context of any overall budget that adheres to the terms of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--the very act that has helped produce the budget surplus that the President is so anxious to spend. 
   To be clear, this bill does include large amounts of funding for a variety of land protection programs. The bill provides about the same amount of funding for Federal land acquisition as was included in the Senate reported bill last year. It also includes significant increases for other land protection programs such as the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund and the Forest Legacy program. The bill does not, however, include funds for the new and unauthorized grant programs requested by the administration, and does not include funds for the Stateside grant program that is authorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. While I am sympathetic in concept to the Stateside program, the subcommittee's allocation does not provide the room necessary to restart the program. 
   Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss the issue of appropriations ``riders.'' This administration has leveled much criticism at this Congress for including legislative provisions in appropriations bills. This criticism is disingenuous in at least two ways. First, there are without question legislative provisions in this very bill that, if removed, would prompt loud objections from the administration itself. Among these are provisions well known to my colleagues, such as moratoria on offshore oil and gas development and a moratorium on new mining patent applications. There are also some less well-known provisions that have been carried in this bill for years, the subjects of which range from clearcutting on the Shawnee National Forest to the testing of nuclear explosives for oil and gas exploration. Nearly all of these provisions are included in the bill because Congress at some point felt that the Executive branch was tampling on the prerogatives of the legislative branch. 
   This leads to my second point. It should be well apparent to my colleagues that this administration long ago made a conscious decision not to engage Congress in productive discussions on a wide array of natural resource issues. Most of these issues are driven by statutes that most reasonable people admit are in dire need of updating, streamlining or reform. Instead, the administration has chosen to implement its own version of these laws through expansive regulatory actions, far-reaching Executive orders and creative legal opinions. When the administration overreaches in this fashion, concerned Senators are compelled to respond. The administration knows this, and has clearly made a political calculation that it is in its interest to invite these riders every year. For the administration to criticize the very practice that it deliberately provokes is, as I have said disingenuous at best. 
   If the administration wishes to take issue with the substance of these provisions rather than hide behind a criticism of the process, it is welcome to do so. Consideration of this bill is an open process. It is not done ``in the dark of night,'' as we so often read. The bill has moved through subcommittee and full committee, and is open for amendment by the full Senate. I expect that we will discuss some of these provisions during the coming debate, and hope that Senators will carefully consider the arguments made on both sides. What I hope Senators will not do, is vote to abdicate the Senate's responsibility to oversee the actions of the executive branch, or sacrifice the power of the purse that is granted to the Congress by the Constitution. 
   With that admonition, Mr. President, it is probably an appropriate time to turn to Senator BYRD and thank him for his assistance in drafting this bill. He has been an invaluable resource as I have tried to be responsive to the priorities of Members on that side of the aisle, and has been particularly helpful in securing an allocation for the subcommittee that enables us to report a bill that is deserving of the Senate's support. I thank Senator BYRD's staff as well--Kurt Dodd, Liz Gelfer, a detailee, and Carole Geagley for all the hard work they have done on this bill. I also want to thank my subcommittee staff for the long hours and hard work they have put in on this bill--Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joe Norrell, and our detailee Sean Marsan. Kari Vanderstoep of my personal staff and Chuck Berwick--who has now departed my office for business school--have also done a great job of coordinating the many parts of this bill that have a direct impact on the State of Washington. 
   Once again, I think this is a good bill that balances the competing needs of the agencies it funds against the broader fiscal constraints that we have imposed upon ourselves. I hope my colleagues will support the bill. 
   There is one final point I want to make, Mr. President, and emphasize to all the Members and their staffs who are within hearing. 
   This is a bill created by many individual Senators' requests for projects in their home States, and sometimes for projects that are regional and national in scope. This year, at least during my tenure, we set another new record. One hundred Senators made more than 2,400 requests for specific provisions in this bill. Obviously, we could not grant all of the requests that are valid. I must say most of them were, in the sense they were for projects that would increase the ambience of the park system, the national historic system of the country as a whole.  
   Senator BYRD and I, working together, have done the best job we possibly could in setting priorities for those programs, within the constraints of a bill I have already said is very limited in the total amount of money we have. 
   So Members' requests that are not included in the bill were not ignored; they were simply omitted either because the given individual had higher priorities within his or her own State or because other priorities intervened in their way.

   Mr. GORTON. Rarely has a debate on an amendment had less to do with the content of the amendment itself. This debate is not about past mining practices or the leftovers from those practices or who will pay for them. The passage of the amendment will not affect that whatever, nor will the passage of the motion to table. 
   Royalties for mining on public lands is not a part of this debate. Passing the Murray amendment will not change those royalties. Passing a motion to table won't change those royalties. The past simply is not involved in this matter. The way in which mining claims are patented is not involved in this matter, nor does this debate involve the environmental laws of the United States. Every plan of operation of a mine must meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, must meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, must meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. You don't get the permit unless you have met all of those requirements. The mine in the State of Washington that was the subject of the earlier amendment in this body met all those requirements, got all those permits, and won tests against them in courts of the United States. And every other mining claim that will come up, if this motion to table is agreed to, will have to meet the same environmental laws. 
   What this debate is about is whether or not the laws of the United States are to be amended by the Congress of the United States or by an employee of the Department of the Interior. This 1872 law has been amended by the Department of the Interior's ruling. No Member of Congress, whatever his or her views of the Mining Act of 1872, should favor the proposition that a bureaucrat can amend the laws of the United States. Of course, we ought to debate the 1872 Mining Act. Of course, we ought to vote on it. We have in fact debated and voted on it here in the Congress. But the fact that the changes have not taken place to the satisfaction of some does not delegate the authority to change the laws of the United States to the Department of the Interior. 
   The subject here is simply that. If this motion to table is agreed to, as the person who will probably chair the conference committee on this subject, I assure you that no final provision will be any stronger than the Craig-Reid amendment because of what the House has done and may well be less sweeping even than that. So at the most, Members, by voting for this motion to table, are voting for the Craig-Reid amendment and 
   probably for something somewhat less stringent.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense of the Senate amendment regarding the recent unilateral action of the EU effectively banning hushkitted and re-engineered aircraft from operating in European Union states. If this rule is implemented on May 1, 2000 it will have a discriminatory impact on U.S. carriers and equipment manufacturers, not to mention setting a bad precedent for action by countries or groups of countries outside of the established International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards-setting process. 
   This legislation was adopted by the EU on April 29, 1999, but implementation was delayed until May 2000 to  allow U.S. and EU representatives to work out the framework of a new, more stringent global aircraft noise standard within ICAO. The Federal Aviation Administration and the State Department have been in negotiations with the EU on the eventual withdraw of this unfair and discriminatory statute. 
   Many of my colleagues have seen recent efforts by the European Union to gain the upper hand over the United States in matters of trade. Aviation has proven to be no different. And this is deeply troubling, because aviation is not only a primary source of a favorable balance of trade for the United States, but, because of its global reach, represents an area where international standards are crucial to facilitating that commerce among nations. Yet, as I stated earlier, the EU has acted to preempt U.S. air carriers and carriers from other parts of the world from serving points in Europe with certain hushkitted or re-engineered aircraft. This restriction applies even though those aircraft fully comply with Stage 3 international noise standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
   This European regulation, although its implementation has been deferred until May 2000, has already created financial hardships for U.S. aerospace manufacturers and airlines. It must be withdrawn or we will see a continued impact on U.S. jobs and profits. Modifying the rule or deferring its implementation for an added period of time will not offer the relief needed by U.S. aviation interests--the financial markets simply do not respond favorably to uncertainty. The U.S. government has engaged in extensive discussions with the European Council for the past year, without achieving a commitment to a repeal of this rule, which I might add expressly protects European aviation interests. The time has come to achieve a timely resolution of this problem through action. 
   The Sense of the Senate resolution I offer today cites the need for complying with international standards in the aviation arena and highlights the problems the rule is causing for U.S. manufacturers and operators. Failing an early commitment by the Europeans to withdraw this arbitrary and discriminatory rule, the resolution calls upon the Department of State to initiate an Article 84 proceeding before ICAO. It is my understanding that this type of proceeding is not a sanctions mechanism, but instead affords a process that provides an opportunity for the international aviation body to rule on whether this regulation complies with international aviation standards. 
   This Sense of the Senate further calls upon other agencies of the executive branch to use the tools at their disposal as well to achieve the early repeal of this rule. There is a broader point to be made as well, which is that, without restoring credibility to the international aviation standards process, we can have little or no confidence about any future international standards adopted by the international aviation community through ICAO. That is a very dangerous precedent for the global aviation environment in the future.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, education has been one of the predominant topics of discussion during the 106th Congress. As you know, I have been vocal in my support of returning decision-making authority to local educators who know best how to address the unique needs of students in their communities. For too long, the federal government has focused on bureaucrats and red tape rather than students and classrooms. In my travels to schools across Washington state, I have heard from educators who are concerned that this burden of federal regulations and paperwork is restricting their ability to instruct children in a common-sense manner. I have had the pleasure of discovering a program which has found a way to thrive in an area which is particularly burdened with federal mandates and red tape--special education. Accordingly, I am pleased to present an Innovation in Education Award to the Hi-Point program at Franklin Pierce High School in Tacoma, WA. 
   I and many of my colleagues in the Senate have heard from constituents about the effects of unfunded mandates on local classrooms. In spite of the burden states and school districts face because of unfunded federal special education mandates, the Hi-Point program has found a way to maximize its staff and community support to create an exemplary program. 
   The key to Hi-Point's success lies with dedicated individuals whose zeal for their job and passion for success are infectious to those around them. Transition Specialist Brian Redman has displayed the kind of compassion, understanding, and drive to see what students can become despite their limitations. In fact, Principal Rick Thompson refers to him as a ``magician.'' Brian has been a Special Educator for over twenty years and the Hi-Point program's success can be attributed directly to the expertise, patience, and skill with which he leads an amazing team of coworkers. This teamwork includes weekly meetings by the Student Services Team to communicate ``best practices,'' and to produce ideas to meet the evolving needs of the students. The team combines the knowledge of the school psychologist, teachers, and a business teacher to ensure maximum preparation for those higher-functioning students who may be able to join the workforce. 
   An examination of the work done by the Hi-Point staff indicates the numerous tasks required by those involved in  special education. Those duties include: budgets, transportation, medications, individual study needs, parent contacts, and cooperation with all school district officials. 
   Hi-Point also utilizes a nurse, a speech therapist, an occupational therapist, and a physical therapist. While this combination of services is not unheard of in many schools across Washington state, and America, it is the creativity of the Hi-Point program in balancing the special needs of its student population with limited budgets, legal restrictions, and at times, intense demands from parents which make the success of Hi-Point all the more striking. 
   Hi-Point programs, coordinated with community agencies, include: A Personal Learning Lab for special needs students in need of support in regular curriculum classes. Basic Skills courses for developmentally delayed students--to learn simple math, how to use a calculator, how to sign a check, and other such necessary tasks. Life Skills such as riding the bus, doing laundry, and cooking meals which are necessary to function in the community. Field Trips to the Zoo, Bowling Alley, and the Grocery Store. Work Crews for Landscape and House Cleaning. An Auto Detailing program to serve as a training ground for students while providing an economic service to the community. 
   Clearly, Hi-Point is not only maximizing its resources to meet the needs of special needs students but is doing so in a creative manner which also maximizes the learning experience of students involved in the program. 
   Too often the Federal Government has done more harm than good in efforts to reach into local classrooms. It is time we changed the focus of federal education programs back to students and learning and away from bureaucracy and process. The Hi-Point program is a shining example of the innovation that can be accomplished in spite of burdensome red tape. Imagine what educators like those at Hi-Point could accomplish without these unnecessary regulations--that is the true untapped resource in education today. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the outstanding work of the Hi-Point staff and in supporting the common-sense idea that educators like Rick Thompson and Brian Redman deserve more say in Federal Eduation programs than Washington, DC, bureaucrats.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate debates education issues and initiatives, too often we talk in the form of numbers and statistics rather than concrete examples of excellence or success in our schools. A 5th grade teacher in the town of East Wenatchee, Washington has come to my attention for her exemplary service to her school, Lee Elementary, and to her community. Her name is Raschelle Freeman and I am pleased to present her with my Innovation in Education award. 
   Ms. Freeman's list of accomplishments is certainly impressive. This year she was chosen as the Washington state recipient of the prestigious Christa McAuliffe Fellowship. Last January she was one of 100 teachers nationwide to receive the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching. This national recognition reflects the respect and admiration of those who work with Ms. Freeman each day. 
   The Assistant Superintendent of the Eastmont School District, Ms. Beverly Jagla, says Ms. Freeman is the ``most effective'' educator she has ever met--``She is energy personified.'' Ms. Jagla further emphasized Ms. Freeman's dedication as a member of the faculty team at Lee Elementary as well as her great skill at mathematics instruction; a talent so considerable that Ms. Freeman leads workshops for superintendents, administrators, principals, and other teachers around Washington state that emphasize ``best practices'' for successful math education. 
   Lee Elementary's former Principal, Ms. Kathy West, noted that in her 22 years in education she has never encountered a teacher who excelled in every instructional area. For example, this past year Ms. Freeman's class put on a major theater production, complete with music and costumes, that was so impressive students from other schools were bused in to see a performance. Ms. West also noted that 12 hour days are the norm for Ms. Freeman as she juggles her many pursuits. In addition to the time spent educating her students and peers, Ms. Freeman spends countless hours writing grant applications to bring more money and resources to her school district. 
   The final testament to Ms. Freeman's devotion is the choice she made with the $34,000 McAuliffe Award. The funds are intended to allow the recipient to take time away from teaching to further his or her own continuing education. Ms. Freeman, however, chose to give the money to her school's Science Math with Accountability and Responsible Technology (SMART) project. The SMART program integrates reading, technical writing, math, science, and technology into an innovative model that will be used to improve the learning of students throughout Lee Elementary. 
   I have long been a supporter of greater flexibility for local educators. It is educators like Raschelle Freeman that demonstrate local communities really do know best. The Federal Government should provide more flexibility to promote the work of educators like Ms. Freeman. I am proud to present her with my Innovation in Education Award, and I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing her accomplishments.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, nothing could more dramatically illustrate the differences in general attitudes and attitudes towards health care between the Senator from Massachusetts and the Members on this side than his statement that his bill would be preferable to ours because it would only ``cost'' the American people $7 billion, while ours would ``cost'' the American people $13 billion. 
   In fact, of course, overwhelmingly, the ``costs'' of his bill will be evidenced in higher taxes on the American people. His so-called ``costs'' of our bill are, in fact, the reduction of taxes on the American people so they can use their own money to take care of more of their own health care costs. But to the Senator from Massachusetts, it is the same thing--more taxes, not less taxes. 
   We do not think that is the same thing by any stretch of the imagination. 
   In addition, of course, he ignores entirely the costs imposed on the American people by paying higher health insurance premiums. Those presumably are irrelevant. 
   But the subject before us primarily is lawsuits. 
   There is widespread agreement in this body and across the United States that the medical malpractice system is simply broken, that it comes too late, that it costs so much, that less than half of the dollars that it costs ever get to victims and the rest is consumed by lawyers and by the administration of the system itself. 
   The problem is, of course, we have never come up with a majority for a way in which to fix that medical malpractice system. But the proposition that it is broken is very widely held. 
   It is into that broken system the Democrats' plan pours another element of our health care system and says: Oh, the system may be broken, but the only solution is to make it worse, is to make it more widespread. 
   Pouring good wine into a broken bottle with what impact? Better health care? No. We know the medical malpractice system doesn't create more and better health care. 
   More lawsuits? Clearly, yes. One aspect of that broken system, of course, is the costs go not into providing better health care for the people of the country but into the system itself. 
   But the patients--ultimately, the people who buy insurance, the people who consume health care--pay the entire bill, including all of the bills for the lawyers. With what impact? Higher costs for everyone who is insured and therefore fewer insured. 
   But I think that is perhaps the least of the vices of the Democratic proposal because it allows, under certain circumstances at least, the employer--the person who is providing health care to his or her or its employees--to be sued. As well, it will drive logical and thoughtful employers out of the business of providing insurance at all. And it will do that in a devastating degree. 
   I suspect that perhaps half of the employers, when they find they are going to be sued, will simply say: We are not interested in any more lawsuits. Sure. We will give each of our employees more money for the cost of that health insurance in cash, and the employee can do what he or she wishes with it.  
   Some will ignore the cost of health care insurance and will become self-insured--some very much to their pain. Others will attempt to buy individual policies, which will inevitably cost more and give them less than any kind of group policy does. So we will have less insurance under this set of circumstances in order to have more lawsuits. 
   Let's go back to this whole idea of medical malpractice as a broken system. 
   What we should be searching for is a better system, and the better system is exactly the plan that the Republican proposal has. It says instead of lawsuits after the harm has been done with the reward, if any, coming 3, 4, or 6 years later, we tell the potential patient who thinks his health care system has not done right by him that he has a right to get an answer promptly before the damage is done. 
   This is the system we ought to expand to other health care systems. This is the system we are asked by the Supreme Court of the United States to apply to asbestos litigation--a unanimous Supreme Court of the United States. 
   But instead, if the Senator from Massachusetts has his way, we will simply take a broken system and apply it in more areas than it applies to right now. 
   That is a perverse answer to a very serious question. We will not treat the patients. They will treat the court system.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I know there is nothing as important as taking care of one's family, especially if a family member is sick. If your daughter gets hurt, you want her healed. If your dad is ill, you want him to get better. It's human nature. Our compassion and desire to help our loved ones is limitless. Caring for your family is as natural as breathing. That's why good medical care is so important to all Americans. 
   Health care is about security, it's about peace of mind. It's very personal. It's about your doctor, your hospital, and your health care plan. It should not be about attorneys, paperwork, and the massive federal government. 
   America is blessed with the best medical care in the world, but the quality of our health care will be jeopardized if we fail to prepare for the challenges of this rapidly developing field. 
   As Congress takes a hard look at the health care system, we need to take a step back from the partisan bickering so often associated with the political system and instead do what's best for our families. 
   So as this debate in Congress ensues, I will support proposals, from either party, that will make health care better. 
   These are the principles I advocate: 
   Ensuring that Americans have access to the highest quality health care available; 
   Making sure that your medical decisions are made by a doctor; 
   Access to healthcare that is affordable; and 
   Creating opportunities for families that are now uninsured to buy health care coverage. 
   Washington families from Poulsbo to Pullman should have access to the best available care when they need it. Congress should implement common sense consumer protections for patients not covered by existing state laws. 
   Patients should be able to go to the nearest emergency room without worrying about whether that hospital is a part of his or her insurance plan's network. They should simply get the care they or their families need. 
   Woman should also have direct access to their ob-gyn for their health care needs, and children need to be able to see pediatricians who specialize in children's health care. 
   The patient-doctor relationship is unique and very personal. Patients should be able to choose their physician; under the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, which I support, they can. 
   Patients should also be confident they are receiving the highest quality health care. It is difficult to keep abreast of the new developments and treatments in the fast-changing world of modern medicine. We have learned more in the last five years about how to improve health care than we learned in the prior 25 years. We need to make sure that hard-working doctors have the tools and the best information they need to provide the best care. 
   Should patients have recourse if they think their plan has been negligent or unfairly denied them treatment? Absolutely. We need to look at models that work during this debate, and adopt health care reforms that move the standard of patient care forward, not back. 
   Some in Washington, DC want to complicate the health care equation. Instead of a quick resolution and access to care when patients need it, patients would have to wait years for the courts to resolve the issue. The problem with that philosophy is that lawsuits are after the fact--the damage is already done. We should focus on quality health care and on treating patients, not spending all time in court. After all, you can't sue your way back to health. 
   Who benefits if we have more lawsuits? Clearly not the patients. One GAO study from 1987 found that cases with merit below $50,000 were unlikely to be pursued by plaintiff's attorneys. And, the time to payoff--if any--takes on average 33 months to be resolved; and medical malpractice claimants only received 43 cents on the dollar. 
   Their plan would allow employers to be sued. But, for many small businesses one lawsuit would put them out of business. In fact 57% of small businesses said they would drop health care coverage for their employees rather than risk a lawsuit that could put them out of business. That is not good for families. 
   I believe there is a better way. Patients should be able to hold their health plans accountable. New internal and external appeals provisions give all patients in group health plans that ability. If a patient believes his plan wrongly denied coverage for a health care service he can access a timely internal review conducted by the plan. If he still disagrees with the plan's determination, a patient can ask for an independent review conducted by a doctor who is a specialist in the area of dispute. The decision of the external review is binding on the plan and the court is able to award monetary penalties if the plan does not comply. 
   There are those in Washington, DC that would extend the arm of the federal government into your families' health insurance--requiring you to pay for benefits you may or may not need. The Congressional Budget Office concludes that the bill offered by the Democrats would cause premiums to rise by 6.1 percent, or $355 per family. 
   Ultimately, increased costs mean more American families can't afford insurance. The Lewin Group estimates that for every 1 percent increase in premiums 300,000 people lose their insurance coverage. A 6.1 percent increase would put health care out of reach for 1.8 million more Americans. In Washington state it means as many as 50,000 more Washingtonians may be unable to afford health insurance. That's unconscionable. 
   Instead, insurance coverage needs to be more accessible to American families. One way to do that is to allow full deductibility of health insurance costs for those who are self-employed--the same benefit many businesses receive. Employees who pay for their families' insurance premiums should also be allowed that same tax deduction. Medical Savings Accounts should be made more broadly available--37 percent of the people currently enrolled in the MSA pilot program were previously uninsured. 
   Our mandate is clear: ``first do no harm.'' This time-tested creed of the medical profession applies to this debate. The challenge is to provide common sense improvements to the current system but not at the expense of increased costs, more uninsured families, fewer health care choices, and another layer of government bureaucracy between patients and their doctors. 
   Let me add, Mr. President, that I think it is important that we have this debate. But, unfortunately, both parties are engaging in political gamesmanship and procedural antics on the Senate floor; each hoping to prove it is the champion of the health care issue. What's the end result? A debate--but, just a debate. 
   That result--no real progress--seems to me the exact result that political Washington, DC is hoping for. Where there was a glimmer of bipartisanship--for example on amendments that would give patients access to clinical trials or end the practice of drive-thru mastectomies--politics reigned. 
   In the meantime, there is a growing crisis in our rural areas as seniors continue to lose access and choice in their health care options. We know that as mandates pile up the cost of providing health care increases. Yet, the Administration's answer to Medicare has been across the board reductions in payments to hospitals and insurance plans. Just two weeks ago a number of plans decided they could no longer afford to do business in Eastern Washington. There is now only fee-for-service in most of Eastern Washington meaning seniors will end up paying more for fewer benefits. 
   Earlier this week, I attended a hearing at which rural hospital administrators testified about the impact of Medicare changes on access to care for seniors in rural areas. As the Administration develops payment systems, and issues its regulations and guidance for Medicare, I continually hear from the medical community, particularly those in rural areas, that the payment reductions and increased paperwork burden are simply intolerable. If hospitals and doctors can no longer do business in rural areas it ultimately means that the quality of care for seniors and other families living in our rural communities is in jeopardy. 
   We must work towards more choice, access and quality care for all Americans; for those who may be in group health plans, the subject of this current debate, but also for seniors and those Americans living in rural communities.  
   Congress' focus should be to create new opportunities for covering the uninsured by enacting provisions to make health insurance more affordable and accessible. We should pass common sense patient protections for those who are currently unprotected by state laws and all patients should be able to hold their health plans accountable. 
   After all, health care is about security, it's about peace of mind, it's about your doctor, and your hospital; but most importantly, its about your family.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the success of legislation in a matter of considerable controversy in our society is always built upon the foundation of compromise. This relatively short debate on the final passage of H.R. 775 is a perfect example of that compromise. The Senator from Oregon, who was so responsible for the final form of this bill, listed all of the changes that he required in order to approve of this legislation. The Senator from Connecticut spoke eloquently of the way in which he worked with the administration to change a ``no'' into a ``yes,'' and make this legislation a reality. My very good friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, spoke of the fact that both the original House bill and the original Senate bill were much more sweeping and much more decisive in dealing with this Y2K problem. He deserves an extraordinary degree of our thanks and our admiration for working constantly and tirelessly toward a successful conclusion, even though that conclusion is not something he regards as wholly satisfactory. 
   I fall on his side of that debate. I think we should have done much more. I am, in fact, a radical reformer in this whole litigation field, whether it is this narrow issue or the broader issue of product liability or medical malpractice or the questionable utility of punitive damages in civil litigation. I would go much further than this bill does. But what we have done is to bring people together to solve a problem in a way that we can deem a success, all the way through to the signature of the President of the United States. 
   During the last 20 years, our society and our economy may have changed more dramatically than in any other similar period of history. We have become a computerized information society, due to the very technological developments that resulted in a Y2K challenge. But the Senator from North Carolina claims to speak for the voiceless. They are not voiceless. They played a major role in this debate. The coalition that has wanted far stronger legislation than this does, of course, consist of software and hardware companies. But it also consists of the great bulk of the representatives of the customers of those companies. The National Federation of Independent Business is the largest single organization of small business in this country. It favors this legislation. It favors legislation stronger than this. So whoever the Senator from North Carolina was speaking for, it was not the small businesspeople who do not look forward to a blizzard of litigation on this subject. 
   Of course, in retrospect, this new technology might have thought about the Y2K problem earlier than it did. But at this point, our goal should be a solution to the problem, not a blizzard of second-guessing litigation, especially litigation that will almost certainly slow down the future development of the very technology that has been so responsible for the growth in the American economy and has caused such significant changes for the good in the lives of people all around the world. 
   This bill is by no means perfect. In the view of this Senator it lacks that perfection because it is not all-encompassing enough. It is, however, at least a modest step in the right direction, one supported not only by the technology companies that are responsible for the computer revolution but by their customers and consumers as well. 
   So with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I can wholeheartedly recommend the passage of this legislation to the Senate and look forward with satisfaction to the President's approval of this bill.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a thoughtful and detailed article appeared about a week ago in the Portland Oregonian indicating public expenditures of close to $1 billion during the current year directed at the recovery of salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest. That is an extraordinarily large amount of money for a purpose of that nature. 
   A modest portion of it comes from State appropriations of the four States in the Columbia River drainage area. The largest single share of that almost $1 billion is paid for through the charges for electric power produced by the Bonneville Power Administration and others, and, therefore, by the residents of the region, but a very substantial share of that money comes from appropriations approved by this Congress. 
   As recently as 1 year or 18 months ago, I and many others in the region were critical of the billions of dollars of spending for this purpose on the grounds that they had shown few, if any results, and that, in fact, salmon runs had declined during that period of time. 
   That criticism is no longer entirely correct. We have had some recent successes, and I will mention a few of them in just a moment. But I think all would agree that those successes are not at this point a proper return on an investment of almost $1 billion a year. 
   For example, with the aid and assistance of my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, the Interior appropriations bill for the current year included $20 million appropriated to the State of Washington for these purposes. And this Senator has to confess that he is not entirely certain what the people of the United States have gotten for that $20 million 
   at this point. 
   This Senator cannot point to a single significant success as a result. Part of the reason, of course, is that in the current year, the spending of that money has not been completed. Part of it is that the programs which it funds are new, and part of it is the fact that the very nature of the salmon resource requires a number of years to tell whether or not any positive results will take place. But nonetheless, we are faced with that very real challenge of determining whether or not we are getting our money's worth out of these investments. 
   For the next year, for fiscal year 2000, I can identify in our own work in this body significant amounts of money coming from the energy and water appropriations bill, especially through the Army Corps of Engineers, through the agriculture appropriations bill, through the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill, particularly  close to $100 million for the enforcement and maintenance of a recent treaty signed with Canada on the subject of salmon in the Northwest, through the Environmental Protection Agency, and once again, through the appropriations bill the Senator from West Virginia and I will manage for the Department of Interior and related agencies. 
   In addition, of course, there will be those huge amounts of money, close to half a billion dollars a year, through rates charged for electricity by the Bonneville Power Administration and somewhat enhanced appropriations from the four States. 
   There are many, and I have been occasionally tempted toward this position myself, who will say that if we are not getting our money's worth and if there are so many different entities spending money on salmon recovery, would it not be appropriate to have a single federally appointed salmon czar who would determine how all of this money would be spent. 
   The argument for that proposition, I think, would be much stronger if there were a single salmon science; that is to say, if we knew precisely what we were doing, if there were one accepted way of getting the most for our money in connection with salmon recovery. 
   Of course, at this point, there is not. There are serious, well-founded debates throughout the country and in the Pacific Northwest as to various, widely different policy prescriptions for salmon recovery. 
   To have one decisionmaker for all of these expenditures is perhaps not wise, at least until we have learned a good deal more about how we go about attaining our goals. 
   I do think, however, there could be considerably more coordination than there is at the present time. Three years ago, I persuaded the Congress, as a rider on an appropriations bill, to create an independent scientific review board to advise the Bonneville Power Administration on how to spend the more than $100 million a year in actual cash grants that it gives for salmon recovery. I had learned in the previous year that those decisions were made by various self-interested parties who awarded almost all of the money themselves without any discernible positive impact at all, and the situation with respect to that roughly 10 percent of the money spent on salmon recovery has been considerably improved by that independent scientific review. 
   I introduced a bill this year that would expand its authority to all the decisions made by the Bonneville Power Administration, not just direct money grants, but revenue foregone from its power cells, and I hope that the Congress will 
   soon consider and pass that proposal. 
   Nevertheless, there remains a great deal of room for additional experimentation in connection with salmon recovery. 
   The bill which will be presented by the Senator from West Virginia and myself in a few weeks for the Department of the Interior will include a modest $4 million figure that will not go directly to the State of Washington, in this case, but will go, I hope, through a nonprofit organization which tells us that it can more than match the amount of money that we will appropriate and will direct most of its money at private volunteer citizen organizations. 
   I have found that those organizations do give us very much value for the money. Earlier this year, one local group of salmon recovery volunteers joined forces with a landowner on Snow Creek in my State. They received the cooperation of the Association of General Contractors in the State of Washington, an association that has a huge investment in connection with salmon recovery because of the impact of the Endangered Species Act on its ability to build. 
   Together, these volunteer organizations and private donors and representatives of the building industry have come up with an extremely constructive and almost certainly effective salmon recovery plan for a single stream. Like them, an organization of volunteers called Long Live the Kings is one of the dozen or more such organizations in the State of Washington, each of which is working on a single stream or group of streams with tremendous volunteer labor and great enthusiasm. Aid and assistance to them without detailed regulation from the State seems to me to be a wise investment of a modest portion of our money in this respect. 
   There are some in this body and others who say this is a regional problem and it should be paid for entirely by the region itself. And certainly the people of the Pacific Northwest put a very high value on salmon recovery. 
   But the way in which they must approach that salmon recovery is governed almost entirely, some would say distorted, by the Endangered Species Act, an act of the Congress of the United States which is both broad in one sense and very narrow in another sense in its scope, and governs many decisions in the State far beyond simply the management of our waters and of our salmon recovery itself. 
   So the Federal Government, having imposed these requirements, has an obligation at least substantially to help fund them. Nevertheless, I am here today to say that while this is a very high priority of the Congress, an extremely high priority of the people in my State and the other States in the Columbia River Basin, it is one on which we know and believe we should be held accountable by the Congress. We will do the best job we possibly can with the moneys appropriated by Congress or directed by Congress to see to it that we are successful. 
   Recent listings in the Puget Sound area now have the Endangered Species Act, for the first time, as having an immense impact on a major metropolitan area in the United States. The people of my State are eager to take on that task. They have asked for modest help from us here. We are giving them that modest help. We will keep Congress and the people of the United States advised of how well we are doing with the generous assistance that my colleagues have helped me to provide.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am greatly dismayed by and strongly opposed to the amendment introduced by Senator BINGAMAN that seeks to express the Sense of the Senate that the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should not receive accelerated consideration for membership in NATO. This amendment most assuredly does not reflect the views of this Senator, and I am certain that of many more of my colleagues. 
   I fail to comprehend the purpose in singling-out these independent nations in this manner. It appears to this Senator, after reviewing both the Foreign Appropriations bill and accompanying report, that there is nothing contained in either document that should provoke the offering of this amendment. 
   It is my firm belief that the NATO alliance can benefit from the inclusion of new Central and East European nations, including the three Baltic states. The Baltic peoples have asked for and deserve protection from foreign invasion, and are willing to join the NATO security alliance to protect other European nations in need of help. 
   Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is essential to their safety and prosperity. Security concerns will take precedence over continued democratic and economic reforms if the Baltics continue to exist, unprotected, in the shadow of an increasingly nationalistic Russia. 
   The United States should and must be vigilant in our efforts to extend NATO's reach to all democratic nations in Europe who cannot protect themselves. If we leave these nations exposed to the risk of foreign invasion and influence, the gains made in expanding democracy and freedom around the world will be vulnerable to erosion. The United States must continue to set an example for the world as a promoter and protector of democratic freedom. As victors in the Cold War, we have never had a greater opportunity than this to show democracy's enemies that we have the courage and the will to stand firm against them. NATO expansion is of vital importance to the future of democracy. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico can only have a negative effect on the United States's efforts to expand and protect democratic development in Central and Eastern Europe. To punitively single-out these three nations as they strive to protect their right to independence and freedom, following decades of Soviet domination, is neither constructive, nor in the interests of the United States. It is my sincere hope that this language will not be included in the final Foreign Operations Appropriations bill passed by Congress for Fiscal Year 2000.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Academic Achievement for All Act. As a parent and grandparent I know that there is no more important issue than our children's education. Education unlocks the door to a lifetime of learning; prepares us to participate in our democracy; helps our children lead productive, independent lives and ensures that our country is economically competitive. Education is a vital issue before the Senate as we consider the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the heart of Washington D.C.'s role in K-12 education. 
   Over the last several years I have talked with countless teachers, principals, parents, and school board members about our educational system. I consistently hear that Washington, D.C. interferes with local efforts to help students achieve high standards. I hear about bureaucratic hurdles, reams of paperwork and one-size-fits-all programs. Based on that input, Congressman GOODLING and I have written a bill that will refocus federal education programs on children and learning instead of process and paperwork. It is based on a fundamental trust that parents, teachers, local educators and states will make the best decisions regarding our children's education, rather than bureaucrats 3,000 miles away in Washington, DC. Its only common sense. 
   For too long Washington's programs have been driven by an obsession to comply with rules and regulations. In our state, 50 percent of all the paperwork an educator deals with is the result of federal programs. Yet the average school district receives only six percent of its budget from the federal government. On a nationwide basis, federal paperwork eats up 48 million people hours per year. That's 25,000 employees working full time on paper, not on helping our students learn. Is our educators' time spent filling out forms or teaching children how to read? 
   Former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett put it succinctly in a recent statement: ``..... our students have fallen further and further behind students in other countries. American 12th graders now rank 19th out of 21 nation in mathematics achievement; 16th of 21 in science; 15th out of 16 in advanced math; and 16th out of 16 nations in advanced physics. And this competition does not include Singapore, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong--which is rather like finishing last in a professional hockey league that does not include Canadians.'' 
   The good news is that we have before us an opportunity to restructure the way the federal government interacts with states and local communities in terms of education policy. We must not continue to support a system that has stifled creativity in states and local communities--the very place real education reform happens. 
   While freedom and flexibility are important, our schools should also be accountable for results--not to Washington, DC but to the standards each state and community has been working on to ensure its students are prepared for the 21st Century. We can't forget that our schools are ultimately accountable to the voters in each community who elect the local school boards and the parents who send their children to our schools. 
   My proposal, the Straight A's Act, will give parents, educators, school districts and states more decision-making authority over the way in which federal education funding is used. It means our children's teachers will spend less time filling out paperwork and more time in classrooms. And, equally important, it means that more federal education dollars will find their way into our children's schools, where they belong. Right now, as little as 65 cents of every dollar the nation's taxpayers invest in education makes it into the classroom. 
   Straight A's relies on a simple formula: Freedom+Accountability=Results. States would have the option of submitting a proposal to the Secretary of Education that would set specific, measurable performance goals to be reached in five years. States would be allowed maximum flexibility with the use of most of their Federal K-12 formula program funds for state education priorities and programs in exchange for being held accountable for meeting the goals set in their proposal. This would allow States the freedom to address more effectively the needs of students in their state. Alternatively, states would be free to continue to administer Federal education programs the old way. Straight A's does not eliminate any program--it's the state's choice to chose its approach. 
   What this means for states and school districts is that they can use federal funds for any initiative that improves performance of students in their state. Those states that choose to participate can focus more funds on disadvantaged students, increase efforts to improve teacher quality, reduce class size or even hook up all their classes to the Internet. The one string is that these efforts must increase the achievement of all students--including the lowest performing students--over the course of five years. 
   If states do not substantially meet those goals, they would lose their flexibility and revert to the categorical, regulated approach under current law. If states do well and significantly reduce achievement gaps between high and low performing students, they may be rewarded with additional funds. 
   Finally, it should also be noted that participating states and school districts would not lose any Title I funding. If Title I, Part A is included by a state, each school district in that state would be assured of receiving at least as much money as they received in the fiscal year preceding the year of the agreements enactment. 
   This proposal will allow educators to do what they do best--teach kids. We should focus on students learning and achieving, not process and paperwork. 
   My colleagues should also know that I did not develop this concept in a vacuum. As I mentioned earlier over the course of the past few years I have heard from literally hundreds of parents and educators about the challenges they face trying to provide the best possible education for their children. In particular, during the last congressional recess period I traveled to several schools around Washington state and had a chance to talk to many educators about my legislation. They've since responded with enthusiastic support for my proposal--I'd like to share some of their comments with you now:  
   We need more control at the local level not more rules and regulations from the federal government.--Dennis Birr, President of the Association of Washington School Principals. 
   Senator Gorton's Straight A's proposal is well-conceived with great flexibility for states and districts. It would help to focus federal resources where they are most needed.--Janet Barry, Issaquah Superintendent and 1996 National Superintendent of the Year. 
   I believe that the choice is very clear. Would I trade the present government restrictions and stifling paperwork for flexibility and higher accountability? The answer is absolutely yes!--Dr. Richard Semler, Superintendent of the Richland School District. 
   The Straight A's Act would release a tremendous amount of badly needed education dollars and give school districts the flexibility they desperately need.--State Senator Don Benton (R-17th) and State Representative Marc Boldt (R-17th).  
   I believe so strongly in the fundamental principal that local people make the best decisions about our children's education that each week I've come to the Senate floor to recognize individuals, schools, and educational programs in Washington state that demonstrate innovation and excellence in education. 
   My first award went to the Tukwila School District which had its ethnic diversity grow by more than 1,000 percent in the last seven years. I had the opportunity to visit this district earlier this year, and I found that 20% of the district's students are enrolled in bilingual education, and all told, they speak about 30 different languages. To meet the challenge of integrating this immigrant population into the school system and the community, the Tukwila School District, the City of Tukwila, and the local Rotary Club created ``New Friends & Families''--a program designed to engage these hard-to-reach immigrant and refugee students and their families to make them aware of community services and to encourage  parental involvement in their children's education. It is programs like ``New Friends & Families'' that illustrate the local innovation and local partnerships working to ensure all of their students achieve. 
   I also had the pleasure over this last break to stop by Chris Luther's 3rd grade class at Beachwood Elementary School. This class did not miss a spelling word on their weekly spelling tests for the entire school year. This is a classroom of average kids, all with different backgrounds and abilities. Yet, Mr. Luther has found a way to encourage and tutor these students so they are all accomplishing equally praiseworthy work. The key has not been some magical formula rather, the success of these students comes from a concerted effort by Mr. Luther to boost their self-esteem, to enhance their memory skills, and to impress upon every child in the classroom that learning is important. Those strategies combined with the individual effort of each of his students has clearly paid off. Those students may not remember how to spell each of the words they learned this year, but they will remember their third grade teacher for the rest of their lives. 
   Then there's Karen Mikolasy, Washington state's teacher of the year, who has taught for 28 years at Shorecrest High School with passion for her students and for her work. She emphasizes consistency and standards. In Mrs. Mikolasy's class homework is handed in on time and papers are rewritten until each student earns at least a B. That consistency in expectations also carries over to consistent positive reinforcement to her students--she tells them daily that it is a privilege to be their teacher. She says that in 28 years, not one day has gone by which she hasn't wanted to be in the classroom with her students. She was also recently recognized as the Washington State Teacher of the Year. In the few minutes I met with her, I understood why she won this honor. Her passion and commitment to educating and inspiring young people was clear. 
   I hope these examples clearly illustrate why it is important that we return to our states and local communities the right to set priorities that reflect the unique needs of their students and allow more districts to have the ability to innovate like the Tukwila School District, and more teachers to spend more time with their students and hopefully emulate the examples set by Chris Luther and Karen Mikolasy. 
   In each of the last two years the Senate has voted to send more money to our classrooms, but the President has threatened a veto. I will try again this year. I'm going to keep fighting for a shift from programs focused on procedures and paperwork to a system that puts student learning and academic achievement first--a system that lets those closest to our children--their parents, teachers, and principals and school board members decide what's best for our children.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few short weeks ago, on the anniversary of the filing of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft, I took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to detail the rapidly changing nature of the information technology industry over that twelve-month period of time. I noted that, just one year ago that day, AOL and Netscape were two large successful companies. A year later, they were a gigantic conglomerate, teamed with Sun and ready to compete in the next frontier of the information technology industry. MCI Communications and WorldCom were two separate companies, as were Excite and @Home. Yahoo hadn't yet bought GeoCities and Broadcast.com. AT&T was a long distance company. A year later, AT&T could have influence over 60% of cable systems in the United States. The stock market had risen dramatically over that year, fueling our unprecedented economic boom. 
   What difference a year makes, I said at that time. 
   Now, last week, we were joined by some of the most brilliant and visionary minds in the world as they testified before the Joint Economic Committee High-Technology Summit. Two of the most brilliant, even among that gathering, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, reinforced the notion of an extraordinarily dynamic industry, and painted a future promising more dramatic change than we have already seen. 
   As the two men who arguably have had more to do with our extended economic expansion than any other in the world--one for his contributions in creating the high-tech boom that has driven the economy, the other for judiciously guiding that economy--we would do well to listen to Mr. Gates and Mr. Greenspan when they offer their thoughts about America's next century. I was struck by the similarity of their views this week as they testified on the future of the information-technology industry, the profound benefits it has bestowed on the U.S. and world economies, and the role government has and should continue to play in sustaining this dynamic and literally world-changing force. 
   To begin with, both Mr. Gates and Chairman Greenspan point to the momentous changes in the way the world operates as a result of this industry's influence. Its innovations are not confined merely to IT products, but to the repercussions of how those products are used. According to Chairman Greenspan, ``innovations in information technology so-called IT have begun to alter the manner in which we do business and create value, often in ways that were not readily foreseeable even five years ago. As this century comes to an end, that defining characteristic of the current wave of technology is the role of information.'' 
   Mr. Gates underscored that sentiment and gave us a glimpse of an even more information-defined vision of the future in which, ``there will be a proliferation of smart, connected devices, from palm-sized digital assistants and tablet personal computers to smart TVS and Web-enabled cell phones. All of your files,'' he told us, ``schedule, address book and everything else you will need will automatically be available on each of these. When you're traveling you'll be able to call up your itinerary, book an appointment or view your stock portfolio using the device you have in hand. It will know the information you need, and when and where you need it. Wherever you are,  you'll be able to access your own digital dashboard--your personal portal to your own secure office desktop on any PC.'' 
   Where will this information revolution lead us? If the past five years are any indication of the future, it looks bright, indeed. 
   According to Mr. Gates, ``The continuing rapid growth in the Internet will help power this information revolution, just as the proliferation of new devices will help make the Internet more useful and accessible to everyone. Five years ago. who would have imagined that people would now be shopping for automobiles, home loans, airline tickets or clothing on the Web? Electronic commerce has increased tenfold in the last few years, making it convenient for people to purchase almost anything, anytime, from anywhere. By 2002, nearly 50 million Americans will be shopping online, spending almost half a trillion dollars on the Web. There is endless speculation about which companies will be successful. The big winner will be consumers. They will see better prices, more choice, more opportunities to do the things they want to do.'' 
   Chairman Greenspan agreed with Mr. Gates' sentiment that consumers have been, and will continue to be, the main beneficiaries of the IT revolution. ``Every new innovation,'' he told us, ``has suggested further possibilities to profitably meet increasingly sophisticated consumer demands. Many ventures fail. But the few 
   that prosper enhance consumer choice.'' 
   Both men pointed to the enormous economic benefit that has accrued from the IT industry's success. 
   ``The unexpectedly strong economic growth this country is experiencing can, in large measure,'' noted Mr. Gates, ``be traced to the vibrant, competitive and fast-growing computer technology industry. This sector has created more new jobs than any other part of the economy. In fact, we can predict today that by the year 2000, the software industry's contribution to the U.S. economy will be greater than the contribution of any other manufacturing industry in America, an extraordinary achievement for an industry that is less than 30 years old.'' 
   Chairman Greenspan underscored just how strong that contribution has been already by stating flatly that, ``An economy that twenty years ago seemed to have seen its better days, is displaying a remarkable run of economic growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in technology. Nor, have the benefits been limited to just our country. All else equal, the enhanced competition in tradable goods enables excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries' markets.'' 
   Chairman Greenspan offered a note of caution, though, as it is his job to do, and as he has done so brilliantly to our economic benefit in the last few years. ``The rate of growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely,'' he warned us, adding, ``experience advises caution.'' 
   We would do well to heed the Chairman's admonition, Mr. President. The IT industry has indeed been a vibrant enterprise, but as Mr. Gates accurately noted, ``the incredible success of this industry in the United States owes a lot to the light hand of government in the technology area, the fact that people can take incredible risks and if they're successful they can have incredible rewards.'' 
   Mr. President, Alan Greenspan and Bill Gates are precisely correct. We must not take for granted the unprecedented success of this industry and the bounty it has conferred upon our country and, indeed, upon the rest of the world. 
   The United States government must refrain from yielding to the temptation to pick winners and losers in the marketplace according to arcane and discredited economic theories that are rooted in ``what if'' wishes rather than ``what is'' actualities. The freedom to innovate and provide quality products that will continue to improve lives is only possible when government does not dictate how young, vibrant, entrepreneurial companies can compete. 
   Again, Chairman Greenspan stated the case lucidly: ``at this stage,'' he told us, ``one lesson seems reasonably clear. As we contemplate the appropriate public policies for an economy experiencing rapid technological advancement, we should strive to maintain the flexibility of our labor and capital markets that has spurred the continuous replacement of capital facilities embodying older technologies with facilities reflecting the newest innovations. Further reducing regulatory impediments to competition, will, of course, add to this process. The newer technologies have widened the potential for economic well-being. Governments should seek to foster that potential.'' 
   Mr. President, I could not agree more. We should be fostering the growth of the dynamic Information Technology industry, not engineering its deterioration into the bureaucratic morass that is government's specialty. 
   Unfortunately, there are some in the Clinton administration who do not share this view. They short-sightedly seek to impose the heavy hand of government on the IT industry to ensure that certain competitors, not consumers, are the ultimate beneficiaries of this economic revolution. Their current project is the break-up of the most dynamic and successful company of the last 25 years--perhaps in U.S. history--the Microsoft Corporation. 
   As I pointed out those few weeks ago, in the presence of a company exerting real monopoly power, competitors would be stifled, prices would rise, choices would be curtailed, consumers would be harmed. In fact, in the last twelve months the real world for consumers has improved by all of these measures. Competition in the technology industry is alive and well and nipping at the heels of Microsoft. Prices are down, choices are up, innovation is rampant--all great news for consumers. 
   And, as these two luminaries of the current golden economic firmament told us this week, the free-market conditions that will allow this great news to continue must prevail: government must keep its hands off of this industry. 
   I would ask that copies of both Chairman Greenspan's and Mr. Gates' testimony be printed in their entirety in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I would urge my colleagues to read and study their remarks, and then to join me in pursuing policies that will ensure that the Gates and Greenspan view of a future IT industry be allowed to unfold, unimpeded by government's misdirected and deleterious hectoring.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate passed a bill that tries to bring some reason to the legal chaos that could result from Y2K failures and Wednesday evening the Senate appointed conferees to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate bills. I rise today to commend the Senate for doing this, and to read from an excellent memorandum underscoring the need for a quick resolution and final passage of a conference report. 
   A memorandum prepared by the Year 2000 Technical Information Focus Group of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the ``I triple E,'' provides the best analyses and explanations I have seen of the complexity of Y2K litigation; of why the argument we heard during floor debate that the bill is designed to protect ``bad actors'' and that it fails to provide sufficient incentives for remediation is generally hollow; and of why it is so important that we do what we can to minimize the economically paralyzing effects of a predictable and utterly overwhelming legal snarl. 
   The memorandum, sent to various members of Congress, is particularly compelling because its authors do not represent businesses that may be sued, but are members of an international non-profit association of engineers and computer scientists.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, no large group of citizens should be required to pay in advance for a project that they oppose, that will have an adverse impact on their lives and livelihoods, and that will almost certainly never be authorized. But that is exactly what has recently been proposed by certain officials of the Clinton Administration. 
   A discussion paper was recently published by these officials suggesting that the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) add significantly to its power charges to its customers in its impending rate case. The purpose of these added charges is to provide a slush fund for the removal of four Federal dams from the Snake River, if that removal is ever authorized or ordered. It is only fair to add that the Clinton Administration has stated that the paper does not now reflect Administration policy, but it has nevertheless raised fears that the Administration might some day try to order such a removal without asking Congress either for the authority or the money to do so. 
   This amendment will prevent such an end run. It does not prevent BPA from including fish recovery costs in its rate structure for the next five years, even in greater amounts than the $435 million per year current limit. It will, however, prevent an additional surcharge for possible dam removal. That project, if it should be proposed, should require Congressional authorization, and a debate over funding sources, only as and when this or any later Administration makes such a recommendation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we continue to attempt to negotiate a way in which to deal with the Boxer amendment in a way that we hope can be worked out, Senators GREGG and SESSIONS then be recognized to offer those amendments, and that the bill be advanced to third reading, substitute the House bill for it and then vote on final passage at 2:15 on Tuesday. We will then begin on Monday, as I have been given to understand it, to do the energy and water appropriations bill, which we may very well be able to complete on Monday. 
   I do find it interesting that the Senator from South Carolina, who successfully, on two occasions, prevented this current bill from coming up at all by filibusters and saw to it that cloture could not be invoked, is now so anxious to finish it. 
   We think this is a very good bill. I said yesterday I hoped that it was stronger, but it is the result of negotiations that have involved Members of both parties. To let the country and the industry look at it over the weekend and to allow both sides on the outside of the Senate to communicate their desires to Senators is a highly appropriate method of dealing with the bill. We will soon propound a unanimous consent proposal to the end that I have just described, and we hope that that unanimous consent will be granted. 
   We will finish most of the debate, I suspect, the debate on all of the amendments to this bill, before this evening, and then go forward with final passage on Tuesday.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is his misfortune, the Senator from Alaska, to not be here on the floor to listen to those eloquent and gracious remarks of the Senator from West Virginia. So I think it falls to me, inadequate as I am, to thank the Senator from West Virginia for those thoughts and to say that it reminds those of us who have not been here quite so long of the magnificence of the personal relationships that are created here by broad-minded Members like the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Alaska  over the years, even though I suspect that during many of those 12,000 rollcalls--literally thousands of them--they voted on opposite sides, sometimes with views that were very strongly held. 
   I think it is only the Senator from West Virginia and perhaps the President pro tempore who will cast more votes than Senator STEVENS, who I note now is here, and I would rather he speak for himself. 
   But I say, Mr. President, through you to the Senator from Alaska, that I was privileged to hear the eloquent remarks about the Senator from Alaska on this occasion that the Senator from West Virginia made. They do great credit to him, and they do equal credit to the Senator who made them.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from California is now back on the floor, and we are dealing with her amendment. 
   There was an extensive effort to reach agreement on a form of that amendment. Regrettably those efforts were not successful. There simply is a significant difference of opinion on the policies that it propounds. I intend to speak for a relatively short period of time in opposition to the amendment. I am certain that the Senator from California would like to speak for her amendment. I know the Senator from Connecticut is here, 
   and I know the Senator from California wishes to speak. 
   Shortly after that succession is completed, if there is no one else who wishes to participate in the debate, there will be a motion to table the Boxer amendment. 
   The Boxer amendment requires, as a part of the remediation, that a manufacturer make available to a plaintiff a repair or replacement at cost for any product first introduced after January 1, 1990, and at no charge under the same circumstances for a product first introduced for sale after the end of 1994. 
   The amendment is overwhelmingly too broad. For example, the Internal Revenue Service allows, at most, 5, and in many cases only 3, years in which to write off the cost of products of this nature, determining that is their useful life. If they are used in a business, therefore, they have been depreciated to a zero value in every case--not every case covered by this matter, but in the vast majority of the cases covered by this amendment. 
   In many of these cases, under the second subsection, it simply means that the plaintiff is entitled to absolutely free replacement. That computer, if it is a home computer, may long since have been relegated to the attic, unused. Yet the original manufacturer would have to replace it. In many cases, the new parts would not work. A 1990 computer is not very readily upgradeable. It does not have the speed or the memory of a 1999 computer. Y2K problems are probably the least of the problems with which such a manufacturer is faced. 
   I spoke yesterday on the bill as a whole, the tremendous way in which our lives and technology have been changed by this revolution; 1990 is several generations ago with respect both to hardware and to software. How do we go about doing this? Precisely what products are covered? 
   We simply have a situation in which the amendment is too broad and missing in specificity. We have an attempt to amend a bill that is designed to discourage litigation and to limit litigation that, if adopted, will significantly increase the amount of litigation and the number of causes of action that would take place without any legislation at all. 
   In other words, this amendment would create new causes of action that probably do not exist anywhere under present law. Under those circumstances, while we should certainly encourage remediation and fixes, this might well have exactly the opposite impact. We have all kinds of duties listed in here with respect to manufacturers--and to others, for that matter. It is not only unnecessary to add this new duty and this new potential for causes of action, this proposal is 180 degrees in opposition. 
   Therefore, with regret and sorrow that we were not able to work it out, I must for myself, and I suspect for a majority of the Senate, object to the amendment and trust we will soon have a vote on that subject.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it constantly amazes me, whether the subject is education or business regulation or computer software, that Members in this Chamber know much more about the subject than do those who are in the business. It is the very companies the Senator from California so praises is doing things right that have felt, in order to concentrate on fixing Y2K problems, rather than having run the gauntlet set for them by trial lawyers, that this legislation is necessary. 
   It is simply because they prefer to fix the problem in the real world than to face endless litigation that we are here today. That same group of highly responsible organizations thinks this amendment will actually create more litigation, that it ought to be entitled ``The Free Computer Act of 1999,'' because really the only way to make sure you are not sued will be to replace the computer lock, stock, and barrel, even if it is three generations out of date, even if it is in the attic. 
   So the reasons to oppose this amendment are quite easy to determine. They are that we want the problem fixed, we want the problem fixed in the real world, not for years and years thereafter, after expensive litigation, punitive damages, consequential damages, everything that afflicts our legal system today. 
   I had hoped we would complete the debate and begin the vote at this point. We have, however, taken too much time. There is now a markup of the Senate Appropriations Committee that involves both me and two of the three other Senators on the floor at the present time. In order to not disrupt that markup, I announce that a motion to table will be made immediately after that Appropriations Committee markup has been concluded. 
   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as one of the original cosponsors of both S. 96 and the bipartisan amendment that now constitutes the base bill before the Senate, I am, of course, strongly in support of that proposal and opposed to the Kerry amendment, even including all of the changes, almost all of which are constructive, that have been added to it during the course of its development. 
   But in reflecting on both my support of the base bill and my opposition to the Kerry amendment, I wish to reflect on the fact that most, though not all, of the major actors in this bill have been Members of the Senate for a decade or so. Each of them can remember that it is a decade or less ago that one of the constant refrains on the floor of the Senate--and for that matter, throughout our society--was our deep concern about American competitiveness. 
   Volumes of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD are filled with speeches about the fact we were losing ground to many of our competitors, most particularly the Japanese, because of their work ethic, because of their educational system, or for a half dozen other reasons. Probably the last such speech was made on the floor of this Senate more than half a decade ago. 
   It is obvious that the United States, whatever its problems then, has had a magnificent recovery and dominates the economic and technical world by as great a margin as it ever has had during the course of the 20th century. 
   While all kinds of American geniuses are responsible for this change, I think it is safe to say that the extraordinary, imaginative, entrepreneurial work of the men and women whose companies make up the Year 2000 Coalition supporting this legislation have the greatest responsibility and deserve the greatest amount of credit for changes in the nature of our economy and of our society and the way in which we live, the way in which we communicate with one another and the way in which we preserve and enhance knowledge. These factors have changed as much in this last decade as in the previous century. 
   It is, therefore, the very people and the very companies that have done more to enhance the quality of life in the United States and the quality of life around the world who have done more to break down barriers between people and regions and nations. It is these people who seek the modest relief proposed in this bill, these people who are so responsible for our economic success.

   Mr. GORTON. This letter was signed by companies or groups too numerous for me either to name or to count. They explicitly state support of the Year 2000 Coalition for S. 96 in the form in which it finds itself now, explicitly opposing the Kerry amendment to that bill. 
   Personally, I think that letter deserves great weight and our most solemn consideration without regard to any of the details of the debate on the differences between S. 96 with its bipartisan amendment and the Kerry amendment. When one goes into the details of those differences, the justification for this letter becomes even more apparent. 
   My long-time friend and distinguished rival in this matter, the Senator from South Carolina, and I have differed on a substantial number of legal concepts that go far beyond Y2K legislation. He knows, as does the distinguished occupant of the Chair, that my own personal preference--and I suspect the preference of the Year 2000 Coalition--would be to abolish the concept of joint liability in its entirety. The concept of joint liability is one pursuant to which a person, a group, a defendant, only partially or even marginally responsible for a given legal wrong, nonetheless can be held responsible for all of the damages caused by all of the defendants against whom a judgment is entered. 
   On its surface and beneath its surface, such a concept is extraordinarily difficult to justify. 
   In the case of potential Y2K litigation, it is even more difficult to justify, as in any typical Y2K lawsuit there may well be dozens of defendants--the manufacturers of all of the elements of what can be an extremely complicated software and hardware production, its distributors, both wholesale and retail, and perhaps many others. The risks to companies, whether sophisticated or unsophisticated in the nuances of the law, the panic created in them, the disruption of their priorities, both in the development of new technology and dealing with potential Y2K litigation, is impossible to overestimate. 
   At first, this bill, or any bill that has seriously been considered here on subjects like this, abolishes in its entirety the concept of joint liability. Even though I prefer the original S. 96 to this proposal, it is a matter that has been worked out very carefully by a group of Republicans and Democrats--one of the most important of whom is the Senator from Connecticut who is present on the floor--to be a result that has broad support not only in this Chamber but around the country as a whole. 
   Just as the Senator from Connecticut and many of his colleagues have compromised on some elements they wish like to have in the bill, so have we on our side, and we have with respect to joint liability. There are some very real limits on it and S. 96, as it appears before the Senate now, and there are a few in the Kerry substitute, but they are largely illusionary. 
   A second field in which there are differences in this bill has to do with punitive damages. How anyone even in this isolated Chamber could come up with a proposition that software companies, members of this Year 2000 Coalition, are so indifferent to the problems of Y2K that somehow or another they deserve to be punished--not in a criminal court but by the potential loss of unlimited punitive damages--is difficult for me to imagine. It is clear by the vehement opposition to limits on punitive damages that there are those in the legal profession who at least hope for the bonanza of huge punitive damage awards, however difficult it is to imagine the justification for such awards as we debate this matter. 
   Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say they hope they can force settlements, even on the part of companies they believe have not been negligent at all, because of the threat, the mere possibility of a very large punitive damage award. 
   I represent one of the handful of States in the United States of America that does not permit punitive damages in civil litigation, that believes that punishment should be a part of the criminal law and not the civil law. I have not noticed, in a long career, that justice is unavailable to plaintiffs in the courts of the State of Washington on that account. I believe we would have a more responsible legal system, a more fair and more just legal system, if the concept of punitive damages in civil litigation was abolished across the country. It is not going to be. It was not even in the product liability legislation of which I have been a sponsor in the past. It was not in the original form of this bill, and it is not in the form that appears before us now. 
   But there are some distinct limitations on punitive damages for relatively small companies, companies that could obviously be bankrupted by punitive damage awards--a bankruptcy that, I submit, in almost every case  would not benefit the economy or the people of the United States. Yet, for all practical purposes, even those minor limitations are removed from this bill in the Kerry amendment. 
   Finally, the Kerry amendment allows for the single form of litigation that may most disturb the members of the Year 2000 Coalition, class actions on the part of consumers, actions in which almost invariably the plaintiffs are nominal plaintiffs, actions in which many of the plaintiffs often do not even know they are plaintiffs, actions that very frequently have been far more on behalf of the lawyers who bring them than on the nominal class of plaintiffs themselves. To allow such actions seems to me to be a serious mistake and seriously to undermine the entire goal of Y2K relief. 
   In summary, I do not think S. 896, as modified, is a terribly strong bill. I think it provides a degree of appropriate relief to a fundamentally vital element of the American economy and the advancement of our own standard of living in a fashion which is important to that industry and in a fashion that is beneficial to that industry. But I do not think it goes far enough. Others think it goes too far. I do believe, however, we have now reached a conclusion that will be supported by a significant majority of the Members of the Senate, members of both parties. 
   I can no longer say, with the changes that have been made in it, that the Kerry amendment is useless, that it provides no relief at all. It does include in it some constructive elements, some which may be appropriate for consideration during a conference subcommittee meeting between the House and the Senate as we put this bill in final form. But in comparison with the base bill before us, it does not provide appropriate relief. It does not meet the minimum needs of the year 2000 Coalition. It does not meet the minimum needs of a standard of reasonable justice with respect to a single problem that will go away shortly after the beginning of the new millennium in a piece of legislation that will not become a part of the permanent law of the United States, because it will not be needed. 
   So, I return to the remarks with which I began. The members of this coalition, the signatories to this letter, have done an extraordinary service, not only to themselves, not only to the American people and the American economy, but to the entire world and to the task of building bridges among people in the entire world. They have asked for help for a single specific problem that faces them and that faces us and will for a few short months and for a relatively short period of time thereafter. They deserve that relief. They deserve it as promptly as we can possibly pass it. And they deserve it with our enthusiastic support.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Mr. Warner, for including an amendment that directs a demonstration project for TRICARE Designated Providers to enroll new military beneficiaries on a 12-month continuous basis. 
   This is a compromise amendment sponsored by Senator SNOWE, which I have agreed to cosponsor. I personally would have preferred a straight-forward amendment that would have permitted beneficiaries the same opportunities to enroll in the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan provided by Designated Providers as is currently available for TRICARE Prime. For the sake of providing fairness to the beneficiaries and affording more health care choices, beneficiaries should be able to enroll at a Designated Provider at anytime during the year. I note that eleven groups representing military retirees recently wrote the Chairman in support of this proposal for open continuous enrollment for the Designated Providers. 
   My preferred amendment, however, was not acceptable to the Committee. However, I am pleased that a compromise advanced by my colleague from Maine was agreeable, which directs a two-year demonstration of continuous open enrollment for the Designated Providers. I urge the Department of Defense to faithfully carry out this demonstration by including as many of the TRICARE Designated Providers in the demonstration as possible. The agreed-to amendment does not restrict the size of the demonstration. Since the seven Designated Providers run the same Uniformed Services Family Health Program, I believe it makes sense to include all of them in the demonstration. 
   At a minimum, I urge the Department to include the PacMed Clinics in my state in this demonstration. The PacMed Clinics pioneered managed health care for military beneficiaries and have provided quality care to military families for a generation. Beneficiaries should have the opportunity to enroll at PacMed during any time of the year, just like TRICARE Prime. Accordingly, the demonstration mandated by this amendment should include the PacMed clinics and as many of the other Designated Provider as possible.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the passing of an eminent teacher, scientist and academic administrator in my state. On Tuesday, May 18, Jim Bethel, Dean Emeritus of the University of Washington's College of Forest Resources, died in a Seattle hospital. 
   Dean Bethel was one of the Nation's most prominent and influential forestry leaders and was recognized both nationally and internationally. During his 17-year tenure as Dean from 1964 to 1981, he was a principal architect of creative educational innovations and related research programs that have endured in one way or another to this day. Furthermore, his extensive experience and leadership in international forestry affairs has contributed greatly to the College's involvement in international academic and research activities. 
   As an administrator, Dean Bethel set an undeniably high standard for his successors, faculty and administrators to emulate. Dean Bethel was responsible for initiating the College's pulp and paper program and the Center for Quantitative Science. Under his leadership, the College was repeatedly ranked among the top five forestry institutions in the U.S. Incidentally, while Dean, Bethel never gave up teaching two undergraduate courses, conducting personal research and advising graduate students. 
   Bethel received a BS degree from the University of Washington and advanced degrees at Duke University. In fact, he was one of the first individuals to be granted a Doctor of Forestry. Bethel held faculty appointments at Pennsylvania State University and Virginia Polytechnic University. During a 10-year stint at North Carolina State University, he was Professor and the Director of the Wood Products Laboratory and acting Dean of the Graduate School. He worked at the National Science Foundation for three years prior to becoming the Associate Dean of the Graduate School at the University of Washington. He also served as Professor and subsequently the Dean of the College of Forest Resources. 
   Several organizations recognized Bethel's scientific contribution: he was elected fellow of the Society of American Foresters, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the International Academy of Wood Sciences. He served on various boards and was a consultant to the National Academy of Sciences. Bethel also served on the President's Council on Environmental Quality. He was one of the founders of the Forest Products Research Society. 
   Bethel has significantly influenced the lives of many professional foresters. Perhaps his greatest and most enduring professional legacy are his graduate students who went on to responsible and successful positions, and the impressive list of professional journal articles and books. 
   Dean Bethel will be missed by those concerned about the scientific stewardship of forest resources in my State and the world.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what a difference a year makes. One year ago last week, the United States Government filed a Sherman Antitrust lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation. This anniversary is a good time to review that lawsuit and to see how radically the universe of competition has changed in just twelve months. 
   I am not at all unbiased. I believe that the Government was dead wrong in bringing this lawsuit. I believe that the lawsuit is bad for consumers, bad for technological innovation, and bad for a marvelous company that is headquartered in my State. 
   But even an independent analysis would conclude that the case that the Clinton administration brought twelve months ago bears little resemblance to the case it now argues. Since then the Government's case hasn't been tried in the courthouse as much as on the courthouse steps, bypassing the law and aimed directly at public opinion through a national media that delights in highlighting any Microsoft misstep even though it has no relation to any harm to consumers. 
   The administration pursues this case for ideological reasons. This administration is filled with people who are offended by anyone or any company that is too successful. They believe that it is fundamentally unfair that Microsoft does so well. Much of the national media seems to share this view. 
   The administration has, however, miscalculated the views of a majority of Americans. Despite the Government's attempts to turn the public against Microsoft, it continues to be one of the most respected companies in America, and a majority of Americans believe Microsoft is right and the Government is wrong in this current lawsuit. 
   In a recent poll conducted by Citizens for a Sound Economy, 82% of those polled responded that Microsoft is good for American consumers. This survey also found that seven-out-of-ten American consumers feel that technology companies, not the Federal Government, should determine what features and applications are included in the software that consumers use with their computers. 
   Most Americans understand the value that Microsoft has brought. Microsoft products make nearly every business in America more competitive. The technology revolution fueled by Microsoft has made Americans secure in their jobs and made more families secure in their future. 
   Microsoft has also helped usher in the most important change occurring on earth: today the power of information has been taken from a few large centralized institutions and put directly into the hands of people in every town and village across our globe via the Internet. 
   The explosive growth of the Internet will eventually have a fundamental impact on every aspect of American life. A recent Newsweek article describes what it calls the ``New Digital Galaxy'' which allows consumers to operate devices from coffee-makers to dishwashers via Internet access. This will introduce a vastly different landscape in high-technology than exists today. Users will not necessarily use stationary Personal Computers to access information, but instead rely on Web phones, palmtop computers and similar technology that is advancing at an exponential rate. 
   The Internet has had the fastest adoption rate of any new medium in history. Over 50 million users were connected in the first five years. To reach the 50 million user milestone, it took 38 years for radio, 13 years for television, and 10 years for cable. On top of this initial growth, the number of users continues to increase by an astounding 37% per year. It is projected that 200 million people worldwide will be connected to the web in 1999, and half a billion by 2003. To handle the volume, the backbone of the Internet now doubles in capacity every 100 days. 
   Not only is the number of users increasing exponentially, but the amount of information available to them is also growing at an unprecedented level. The International Data Corporation estimates the number of web pages on the World Wide Web at 829 million at the end of 1998, and projects that the number grow by 75 percent to 1.45 billion by the end of 1999. By 2002, according to IDC, there will be 7.7 billion web pages. 
   What does this mean to the future of global commerce? Considering that 18 
   million consumers made purchases on the Internet in 1997, and that number is projected to increase to 128 million by 2002, the possibilities are limitless. In  real dollars, this translates into $200 billion in Net-based commerce by 2000, and $1 trillion by 2003. 
   We can't begin today fully to understand the scope of freedom for people that this information revolution will bring. And all the while Microsoft and its competitors continue to bring better products at lower prices to all consumers. 
   While this case has been in the court, we have heard almost no discussion about whether the dramatic changes of the last year have rendered this case moot. I believe they do, and here's why. 
   In the presence of a company exerting real monopoly power, competitors would be stifled, prices would rise, choices would be curtailed, consumers would be harmed. In fact, in the last twelve months the real world for consumers has improved by all of these measures. Competition in the technology industry is alive and well and nipping at the heels of Microsoft--all great news for consumers. Prices are down, choices are up, innovation is rampant.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, over the weekend Vice President Gore outlined his vision for American education if he becomes President. The speech was billed by the Washington Post as the Vice President's ``vision for American education in the 21st Century''. Unfortunately for our children, the Vice President's vision for American education in the 21st century looks a lot like the failed policies of the last 35 years. 
   The VP's speech laid out seven new proposals for American education--seven proposals that all say AL GORE knows more about educating children than do parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members all across America. Seven proposals to add to the hundreds upon hundreds of education programs run by the federal government, so many in fact that no one, not the Department of Education, the General Accounting Office or even the Vice President, is sure how many there are. Seven proposals that will add to a system of top down control of education that puts a higher priority on adults filling out forms correctly than on children passing a math or a spelling test. 
   Today, President Clinton unveiled his proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Unfortunately, the President's proposal is filled with more of the ``D.C. knows best'' programs he has touted for the past 6 1/2 years. For example, the President's proposal for reducing class size is filled with requirements for states and districts to comply with, but does not address the issue of children learning. 
   For most of this half century Washington, D.C., has been dominated by people who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control exercised by Washington, D.C., is the best way to solve problems, including those in the classroom. This approach has not worked. As Washington, D.C., has taken power and authority from local school districts, our schools have not improved. But, old habits die hard. The belief in centralized power is still very much alive, and embodied by the President's and Vice President's proposals. 
   I don't believe AL GORE or Bill Clinton know more about what America's schools and communities need than they do. In fact, I don't believe that I or any other member of Congress or the Administration knows more about educating children than do parents or local educators. Unfortunately, AL GORE and Bill Clinton have indicated that they will continue on the path they've trod throughout their administration--a path that begins and ends in Washington, D.C. 
   In 1997 I first proposed an amendment to the fiscal year Education funding bill. It was stated clearly in that amendment that I believe that those closest to our children--their parents, teachers, superintendents and school board members--are best able to make decisions about their children's education. Last year, I refined that legislation to include a ``triple option'' that would allow a state to decide where the federal education dollars should go. Both proposals passed this body by slim margins and were immediately met with a veto threat by the Administration. 
   This year, I have worked with a bipartisan coalition of members and groups to devise legislation that will allow states maximum flexibility in return for increased accountability for the academic achievement of their students. My bill, the Academic Achievement for All Act, or Straight A's, will be introduced after the Memorial Day recess. I am hopeful that this time my colleagues in the Senate will join me in giving back to states and local communities the ability to make critical decisions about the education of their children. 
   This issue boils down to each Senator asking if he or she believes schools will be improved through more control from Washington, D.C., or by giving more control to parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members? I believe our best hope for improving the education of our children is to put the American people in charge of their local schools.

    Mr. GORTON. Today, I would like to recognize Melissa York, a teacher from Tyee High School in Seatac. She has won Washington State's 1999 James Madison Memorial Foundation Fellowship which will pay for her graduate school program. 
   James Madison was perhaps the hardest working and most widely respected man of his day. Commonly hailed as the Father of our Constitution, Madison had more to do with its conception than any other man. He was the driving force in organizing the convention and in establishing the tone and ironing out each obstacle that threatened the success of the Constitution. 
   Because of Madison's tremendous contributions to the creation of the Constitution, Congress decided to establish the Memorial Foundation Fellowship to recognize Americans who  teach American history and the Constitution to our young people. 
   Each day Melissa teaches eleventh and twelfth graders about the Constitution and how it is used in everyday life and how it is reflected in our society. The future of our country depends on today's students and on their knowledge and comprehension of our Constitution and government. 
   She not only gives her students greater understanding of our country, but she also inspires her students to achieve more through her example. By continuing her own education, Melissa is showing her students that the educational process should never end. 
   I applaud Melissa for her hard work and dedication to her profession and for her commitment to her students and to learning.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield myself 5 minutes off of the time of Senator STEVENS. 
   Eleven billion dollars in this bill are earmarked to pay for the costs of the war in the Balkans and its consequences, direct and indirect. That war was begun in folly and has been conducted since with an almost incredible degree of incompetence. I have opposed the war from the beginning and will not support it now. 
   The conflict was begun because of Serbia's refusal to sign an agreement granting autonomy to the people of Kosovo and protecting its citizens. Other demands, including the free right of NATO troops to travel through any part of Yugoslavia, were impossible for any sovereign nation to agree to. 
   Our goals were worthy. But they were not of sufficient importance to vital American interests to warrant the use of our armed forces in combat. This proposition is perhaps best illustrated by the President's refusal to use all of the means necessary to attain his goals, choosing to cause death and destruction to the Serbs, and suffering, dislocation, and death to the very people we purport to protect, than to risk American lives in order to succeed. This is no way to wage a war. 
   But vital American interests have been seriously and adversely affected by the war itself. We have destabilized Macedonia and Montenegro, and perhaps other nations in the Balkans as well. We have damaged relations with Russia and may have pushed it along the road to reaction. We have put ourselves on the defensive with respect to China when we should have the high ground in many of our differences. We have fueled anti-American sentiment around the world. 
   If we win, we get to occupy Kosovo for a generation and to spend billions rebuilding it; if we lose, we are humiliated and NATO is weakened. 
   In addition, this war appropriation comes to the Senate in a form in which it cannot be amended. I, for one, am denied the opportunity to attempt to earmark a modest portion of this money to arm the Kosovo Albanian rebels. It is inconceivable that we should trigger this ethnic cleansing, refuse to intervene on the ground to defend the Kosovo Albanians, fail even to attack their persecutors effectively, and top it off by refusing to aid those who wish to fight for their own liberties. 
   Finally, of course, this entire emergency appropriation comes straight out of our Social Security surplus. I am not sure that the American people are at all aware of this fact. I cannot believe that they would support it. At my behest, the conference committee added managers' language calling for the restoration of this borrowing to the Social Security Trust Fund out of future general fund surpluses. But the language is not mandatory, and may well be ignored. We should not use Social Security to pay for a war in the Balkans. 
   For these reasons, and in spite of its many good and important provisions on other issues, I oppose this supplemental appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senate bill 254 does not, in my opinion, warrant passage. I will vote against the bill because it is fundamentally fraudulent. First, it wrongly assumes that Washington, DC has the answers to juvenile crime and the right to impose its will over that of state and local communities. Second, it is fraudulent because it promises billions of dollars for new programs that will not be implemented because the money is simply not available. 
   To hold out the false hope that the federal government can, through the passage of yet another law, offer an easy solution detracts from the important, and admittedly difficult, work that must continue in our homes, schools and communities. 
   As difficult as it may be for many of my colleagues to accept, the cure for the violence and disrespect for life that is prevalent in our society, particularly in our younger generations, will not be found in this body by passing another federal law. I wish it were that easy. The cure will be found after a great deal of soul-searching by our nation at all levels. Parents must re-engage in their children's lives. Schools must work harder to spot the warning signs displayed by our troubled youth and take action before tragedy occurs. And those who market gratuitous violence--whether it be through television, movies, video games or the Internet--must consider the responsibility they have to society, as well as to their bottom line. Most decisions should be made in our communities, not in the Congress. States should be allowed to experiment with a wide range of programs, not told what to do by Washington D.C. 
   I recognize some positive elements in this bill. The relaxation, for example, of the strict sight and sound separation requirements between juvenile and adult prisoners is a common sense change consistent with the views expressed by law enforcement officials in my state. Although I support the Ashcroft Amendment that gives local educators the flexibility to treat equally all students who bring guns to schools, the law it amends is fundamentally flawed and requires more thorough debate. I intend to have this debate later this year. 
   The positive elements in S. 254, however, are outweighed by the negative: the bill usurps state, local, and private sector authority, both in spirit and in practice. For example, although S. 254 makes federal juvenile adjudication and conviction records available to schools in certain circumstances, thus permitting school officials knowledge of the conceivable monstrous acts of a prospective student, it then prohibits all schools, once privy to that information, from using it in admissions decisions. 
   The bill makes promises we cannot keep and creates expectations we cannot meet.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on April 20, 1999 two Columbine High School students in Littleton, Colorado, swept into that school with sawed-off shotguns, one pistol, one semiautomatic rifle, and as many as 60 homemade pipe bombs. Before they turned their guns on themselves, they killed 12 fellow students and 1 teacher and wounded 21 others. In doing so, they violated 17 separate federal and Colorado state Statutes relating to guns and explosive devices, not to mention a host of criminal laws criminalizing their assaults and murders. 
   In a justified aftermath of horror and revulsion, wide-ranging public opinions across the United States demands that the federal government do SOMETHING, anything, to make this violence go away. The most prominent call is for more gun laws, many of which raise serious constitutional questions under the 2nd Amendment. 
   Other attack Hollywood and the Internet for the pervasive violence in movies, music and the Internet, all easily available to the most impressionable of our teenagers. Any controls of this nature clearly run afoul of the 1st Amendment. 
   Others blame parents, the lax law enforcement and the schools themselves. Few, curiously enough, recognize the reality of an evil that lurks in the minds of at least a handful of human beings and is clearly beyond the ability of any law to control. 
   It would be wonderful if we could just pass a law through Congress, another gun control measure or another limitation on free speech that could prevent another Littleton, Colorado, or Jonesboro, Arkansas. But who, in the calm aftermath of this tragedy, believes that two or three more gun laws, in addition to the dozen and a half violated by the two Colorado teenagers, would have made the slightest difference in Littleton? 
   The perpetrators of this violence were far beyond caring about adhering to human laws. They were bent on killing. The arena in which to reach and stop this evil is not Congress. It is in those places where the human heart can be touched; the home, the community and the church, and in the humility to recognize that no human efforts will ever eliminate all evil from human hearts. 
   My children were in high school 25 years ago and I am struck by the thought that this kind of extreme violence involving school kids did not happen in America then and in my own high school years more people may have owned guns than do so today. I can't help but ask: What has changed? Why does this happen now? 
   The Senate has begun a debate of a Juvenile Justice bill that will serve as a vehicle for a number of amendments relating to guns and explosives. At least eight different such proposals were submitted to Congress by President Clinton in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. This is the same President whose budget, bloated in so many other respects, makes drastic cuts in the field of effective law enforcement assistance. This year, for example, over President Clinton's objection, Congress will continue to fund a Byrne Grant program--a program that encourages cooperative drug enforcement and treatment mechanisms across the country and in my State of Washington. Last year Washington State received $10 million in Byrne Grants, without which our law enforcement officials would find it next to impossible to combat the biggest drug problem in our state--meth labs. Despite this success, the President proposes drastic cuts in this successful program. 
   Clinton's budget also zeroes out funding for a huge law enforcement program--the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants, which Washington state uses to help fund prison construction, was gutted in Clinton's budget--from $772.5 million in FY 1999 to $75 million in FY 2000. 
   Far better to fund anti-crime programs that have proven to be successful than to ignore those successes and substitute new statutes on the backs of statutes that have been unsuccessful in attaining their own goals. Why not enforce the gun laws we already have than add new ones to those the Administration ignores? 
   Let me make a point clearly here--I thrive on working as an elected official because I believe that sensible actions by government can have a positive impact on the lives of families and communities across America. 
   One positive role for government is in promoting a safer society. As Washington State Attorney General and now as Senator, I have supported laws to make safer products for consumers including safe food, clothes, cars and highways. I have worked nearly every day in the last three years on the issue of school safety to change federal rules to give more flexibility to local school districts to expel violent students. Individuals in our society cannot assure a safe food supply or safe products or safe roads, so taking sensible steps to make lives safer is a proper function of government. 
   Still, I am convince that more laws would not have prevented what happened in Littleton and, what is more important as we look forward--I believe that it is dangerous to 
   promote legislation as a solution. What is wrong with the President's gun law proposal and any other legislation promoted under the banner of stopping violence? They are wrong because they are a mirage. We are repulsed by violence and the mirage of a federal government's answer to violence raises false hopes. The false hope that violence will be stopped by new federal laws is also wrong because it detracts attention from the need to fix what is wrong in individual families and communities the need to concentrate on those sick elements in our nation that promote violence and disrespect for life. This violence stemmed from an evil that found fertile ground in the hearts of two impressionable boys in Colorado and another federal law will not eradicate that evil. 
   There are things that government can do to make our society safer, including making our schools safer, and we have already passed one amendment to just that end, but the scope of evil which showed its face in Littleton is beyond the reach of government action. Controlling violence of this scope will come when people care more for each other and I, for one, will not join in any chorus of politicians promising that government will make that happen. 
   I know that there are people of goodwill who disagree with me. They want so desperately to do something about this horrible event. I understand that desire. If I agreed, I would have already introduced legislation. But I believe that actions closer to home are far more likely to be successful. I know that this is a radical concept, but most of what is good about America is not made so by federal legislation. People across our country are searching their hearts and their communities for answers. In hundreds of local papers you can see that nearly every school district in America has already called together teachers, parents and community members to see what can be done locally. Local people in their churches of all denominations are getting together to see how they can do more to reach kids in trouble. And every parent in America has considered carefully whether his or her children are at risk of committing violence. 
   We should allow this process of national soul searching to continue. If out of this process positive actions for the federal government emerge we should respond, but we should not hold not immediate federal action as false hope in place of the real actions and changes that will take place in communities, homes and schools across America. 
   It is difficult in this body to face the fact that we don't really need new laws as much as we need the enforcement of the laws we already have. Even more important than that, however, is a thorough examination of the culture of violence in our society and a broad base societal demand that those who profit from that violence, in the media and elsewhere, be brought to show more responsibility and more restraint. 
   I am concerned that the underlying Juvenile Justice bill suffers from the same defects. While it includes a few good ideas, it is another example of Washington, DC knows best. It spends money we don't have and tells every state and local government that we here in Washington, DC, know more about juvenile justice than those who spend their lives on the subject do.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this week hospitals and communities across America are celebrating National Hospital Week. This week is set aside to celebrate the caring and commitment of our nation's hospitals and health systems and the workers, volunteers and other health professionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for their neighbors who need them. 
   An example of this dedication is Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital in Yakima, Washington. I want to commend Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital for receiving the American Hospital Association's 1999 NOVA award. These awards spotlight innovative community partnerships that respond to local needs. 
   Yakima Valley Memorial was chosen as a NOVA award winner for creating the Children's Village for children with special health care needs. The entire building has the feel of an old western town. It features logs on the outside, stone floors, a covered wagon for a reception desk and an elevator disguised as a mineshaft stocked with treasure. 
   More important than the architecture is the integrated services of fourteen area health, education and service providers that work together at the Children's Village. Children that used to travel two hours or more for care now have access to specialty care in their local community. Parents can schedule a single appointment for their child that combines several treatments and therapies. The village also offers specialty clinics for fetal alcohol syndrome, cardiology, neurology, and cleft lip and palate. 
   I am proud to recognize Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital for its achievements. It is an outstanding example of a hospital that makes a difference in its community.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr President, today's thrift industry is an important provider of mortgage loans and consumer financial services. 
   The thrift industry is required to focus its resources on providing consumer and community-oriented credit. For example, current law requiries a unitary thrift to devote at least 65 percent of its assets to mortgage, consumer, and small business loans. In addition, the commercial lending authority of federal thrifts is strictly limited to 20 percent of assets of which half must be to small businesses. 
   This ``specialization'' works. The last time Money magazine published an article identifying ``the best bank in America'' for quality and low cost pricing of its services, the recognized institution was a thrift--USAA Federal Savings Bank. 
   Similarly, the last time Consumer Reports surveyed ``the best deals in 25 cities'' for checking accounts, 77 percent of the leading institutions were thrifts. This large percentage is noteworthy becasue less than 18 percent of the banking institutions existing at the time were thrifts. Thrifts are a minority of the competitor but offer a majority of the best deals. 
   The unitary thrift structure allows the capital from commercial companies to support the community lending activities of the thrift charter. 
   More than 166 applications from nonbanking firms have been filed with the federal thrift regulator to charter new thrift institutions since January 1997. These new charters, if approved, will add competition in the marketplace which will benefit the consumer. 
   The OTS has testified that commercial firms contributed more than $3 billion in capital to support thrift institutions in the 1980s. 
   No safety and soundness issues have been presented by the unitary charter. 
   In February 1999, the FDIC testified on the subject of financial modernization before the U.S. House Banking Committee. In its testimony, the FDIC argued that commercial companies have been a source of strength rather than weakness to the thrift industry and that limiting the non-financial activities of thrifts ``would place limits on a vehicle that has enhanced financial modernization without causing significant safety-and-soundness problems.'' 
   Similarly, the OTS director has testified that there is no evidence that the concerns about the mixing of commercial banking and commerce apply to thrift holding companies with commercial affiliates: ``Congress made a deliberate distinction in the treatment of thrifts and their holding companies based on the fact that thrifts cannot engage in the traditional type of banking activity--unlimited commercial lending--that raises concerns with the mixing of banking and commerce.'' 
   The combinations of thrift and commercial firms have compiled an exemplary safety and soundness record. During the height of the thrift crisis, the failure rate of commercially affiliated thrifts was approximately half that of other thrifts. Moreover, the federal thrift regulator has reported that only 0.3 percent of enforcement actions against thrifts and thrift holding companies from January 1, 1993, through June 30, 1997 were against holding companies engaged in non-banking activities. In short, the industry's experience with commercial affiliates has been the opposite of what the critics contend. 
   Concerns about commercial banking and commerce are misplaced in the context of the thrift charter. 
   Current federal law expressly prohibits a unitary thrift from extending credit to a commercial affiliate and prohibits a thrift from tying deposits and loan services to non-financial services. 
   The statutorily mandated focus of the thrift charter on providing mortgage, consumer, and small business credit along with these other lending limitations distinguishes the thrift and commercial banking industries. 
   Martin Mayer, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and foe of mixing banking and commerce, supports the commercial ownership of thrifts because of their unique lending focus on consumers and small businesses. 
   Financial modernization should be about expanding chartering options and choices for consumers, not contracting these options. 
   While I believe there is a very strong case for fully maintaining the unitary thrift charter as a viable chartering option going forward, this Congress should, at a minimum, not limit the authorities of existing companies in the absence of any compelling safety and soundness evidence about this charter. 
   The grandfather provision in S. 900 accomplishes this minimum treatment for these existing companies that are focused on delivering consumer and small business credit in our communities. 
   The Senate and House Banking Committees both have adopted substantially identical unitary thrift grandfather provisions, which already represents a delicate compromise taken by both committees on this issue. We should not reopen this issue. 
   I urge you to oppose the Johnson amendment as a serious step backwards in our efforts to modernize our nation's financial services laws.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, financial modernization should be about expanding chartering options and choices for consumers, not about stripping away the fundamental characteristics of consumer-oriented institutions. It is a paradox that the banks that are here seeking more powers wish to restrict the powers of their competitors in the same bill and are using this amendment to do so. 
   Proponents of this amendment contend that the unitary thrift charter is a ``loophole'' that allows for the mixing of banking and commerce. Those concerns are both misplaced and impossible under the very conditions of charter. 
   Federal law now expressly prohibits a unitarian thrift from lending to a commercial affiliate. By law, a thrift must focus on providing mortgage, consumer, and small business credit, and its commercial lending is severely restricted. 
   The thrift charter is unique. Martin Mayer, who is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and a foe of mixing banking and commerce, supports the commercial ownership of thrifts because of their unique lending focus on consumers and small businesses. In the more than 3 decades that unitary thrift charters have existed, there is a total absence of any evidence that unitary thrifts' commercial affiliations have either led to a concentration of economic power or posed a risk to the consumer or the taxpayer. To the contrary, the FDIC has testified that limits such as those proposed in this amendment would restrict ``a vehicle that has enhanced financial modernization without causing significant safety-and-soundness problems.'' 
   The issue under debate is not the creation of a banking-commerce Frankenstein. It is, rather, about the proper treatment of longstanding institutions focused on serving local communities. Congress should not limit the authorities of existing consumer-oriented companies without a compelling reason. To do so would be anticompetitive and anticonsumer. 
   I am adamantly opposed to any initiative that eviscerates the unitary thrift charter and urge Senators to oppose the Johnson amendment as a serious step backwards in our efforts to modernize our Nation's financial services laws. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time, and I move to table the Johnson amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I support the distinguished Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, in his advocacy of his own proposal and in his desire that we defeat the substitute which is before the Senate at the present time. 
   He has stated in great detail his reason for his support and the majority support for his financial reorganization bill. I mention only three differences that seem to me to be very significant. 
   One is the arcane but vitally important difference between a holding company structure and a structure of making subsidiaries. In this respect, it seems to me the holding company system has worked well for this country, literally for generations. The advice of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, overwhelmingly supports the proposition of the choice that has been made in this regard by the committee majority itself. 
   Second, with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act, it also seems to me that the chairman's modest reforms are steps in the right direction. They do not destroy that system by any stretch of the imagination but, they do fire a warning shot across the bow of those who would use that bill for extortion purposes. 
   Finally, and most important to me in my own State, is the way in which the bill, is against the proposed substitute, deals with unitary thrifts. A unitary thrift is authorized to affiliate with both financial and commercial companies. This authority is balanced both by lending restrictions and by safeguards prohibiting thrifts from extending credit to a commercial affiliate. This chartering structure has been available for more than 30 years. To the best of my knowledge, during that 30-year period of time, 30 years during which thrifts have been allowed to combine with commercial firms, there have been no major scandals, no serious corruption, no sapping of America's capitalism vigor. In other words, to limit the authority of thrifts while we are extending the authority of commercial banks in the bulk of this bill is to deal with an evil that simply does not exist. 
   Financial modernization should be about expanding choices for consumers and chartering options, not constricting those options and stripping existing authorities from consumer-oriented institutions without sound policy justification. 
   I do not believe we should limit the unitary thrift chartering option at all. Unitary thrifts have a longstanding record of serving their communities. There is a glaring absence of any evidence that their commercial affiliations have led to a concentration of economic powers or posed risks to consumers or taxpayers. This legislation includes a provision that grandfathers the commercial affiliation authorities of unitary thrifts chartered or applied for before February 28 of this year. Given the lack of any evidence that those affiliations are harmful, financial modernization should, at the minimum, not roll back the authority of existing unitary thrifts. 
   Limiting the ability of commercial firms to charter thrifts in the future is debatable policy, but there is no question in my mind that the authorities of existing unitary thrifts should not be abolished. 
   For these reasons, I oppose the Democratic substitute and intend to fight any later amendment which deals with this issue alone. 
   With the expression of my support for the position taken by the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, ``Teacher''--Webster's defines a teacher as one who ``imparts knowledge of or skill in'' a particular subject matter. Teaching, of course, extends far beyond that clinical definition. Many teachers bring passion and dedication to their work that often reaches outside the classroom as teachers serve as mentors, coaches, advisors and friends to their students. Each of us can remember a teacher who inspired us, motivated us, even changed our lives. 
   The students at Shorecrest High School in Washington state have just such a teacher. Karen Mikolasy has taught for 28 years with passion for her students and for her work. She emphasizes consistency and standards. In Mrs. Mikolasy's class homework is handed in on time and papers are rewritten until they earn at least a B. That consistency in expectations also carries over to consistent positive reinforcement to her studnets--she tells them daily that it is a privilege to be their teacher. She says that in 28 years, not one day has gone by which she hasn't wanted to be in the classroom with her students. 
   I was honored to meet Mrs. Mikolasy a few weeks ago in my office while she was in DC to be recognized as the Washington State Teacher of the Year. In the few minutes I met with her, I understood why she won this honor. Her passion and commitment to educating and inspiring young people was clear. The words of her students however, are probably the best tribute. 
   One student characterized Mrs. Mikolasy this way: ``..... she teased, she nagged, fumed, roared, tested and laughed. She turned us into real readers. She led us through worlds both familiar and foreign. There are still rumors that hint at her unwavering stance in class, but one legend should not be overlooked for forgotten. Mrs. Mikolasy is and always will be a masterful teacher.'' 
   Mrs. Mikolasy also tells a story about a package she received one day from a former student who is now a lawyer. The package, in which was a Mont Blanc pen, also included a note: ``Dear teacher, big case, won lots of bucks! Won case because of writing. You taught writing: you get pen. I did writing: I get money. Spend money. Money gone? Do more writing, get more money. Writing not work, maybe I come get another writing lesson.'' It is said that while most Americans spend their living building careers, teachers spend their careers building lives. That certainly seems to be the case with Karen Mikolasy. 
   So today I recognize Karen Mikolasy with the Innovation in Education Award. This is an award I give out each week to recognize people who make a difference in our local communities. It is based on the common-sense idea, that it is parents and educators who look our children in the eyes every day who know best how to educate them. Karen Mikolasy is most deserving of this award. 
   Last night another experience made clear to me the impact teachers can have on their students. I attended an awards dinner for the ``We the People ..... the Citizen and the Constitution'' program. The program encourages junior high and high school students to study the constitution by developing competitive teams at each school. Each team has a teacher as a coach. Last night each teacher was recognized. There were no fewer than 1200 students giving their teachers standing ovations and cheering in appreciation of their efforts. 
   I also like to recognize all of the teachers in Washington state, who demonstrate their passion for teaching and for kids every day in the classroom. Today and the balance of this week is set aside to honor and celebrate teachers. I know that all of my colleagues will join me in recognizing our wonderful teachers across the nation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this week's Innovation in Education Award recipient is an award winning class from Tahoma High School in Maple Valley, Washington. Earlier this year 29 exceptional students from Tahoma High School in Washington state won Washington state's competition testing their knowledge of the Constitution. As a result of that victory, this past weekend they were in Washington, D.C. to participate in the national finals of the ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. 
   The ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution'' program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, provides our elementary and secondary students a strong foundation in the history and philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. That foundation ultimately promotes a sense of civic responsibility in these students and provides them with the means to act effectively within a democratic society. 
   The final activity in this program, which took place April 30-May 3, is a simulated congressional hearing in which students ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. I am happy to announce that I attended last night's award ceremony which the Tahoma High team won a regional award. 
   I am proud of the achievement of these students and am happy to recognize them. They are Adam Baldridge, Mary Basinger, Josh Bodily, Sydney Brumbach, Katie Carder, Erica Chavez, Elizabeth Dauenhauer, Steven Dekoker, Meaghan Denney, Nathan Dill, Marisa Dorazio, Jesse Duncan, Jayson Hart, Jon Hallstrom, Carolyn Hott, Daniel Linder, Casey Lineberger, Clark Lundberg, Karrie Pilgrim, Michael Pirog, David Rosales, Jason Shinn, Jeremy Sloan, Justin Sly, Donny Trieu, Orianna Tucker, Jessica Walker, Raymond Williams, and Elizabeth Zaleski. I also recognize Kathy Hand, the Washington state coordinator for the ``We the People .....'' program, and Kristy Ulrich, the district coordinator. 
   Finally, I applaud Mark Oglesby and his assistant Stephanie Galloway, the teachers who have led their Tahoma High School class to this national competition, and have taught the past four  state championship classes from Washington state. That track record shows great leadership and dedication to the education of their students. 
   I enjoyed meeting with the students this weekend and wish them the best for their future. They will certainly be well prepared for it.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, should the Congress, in the words of the McCain resolution, authorize the President ``to use all necessary force'' to accomplish U.S. objectives in Yugoslavia? That is the question upon which we will be voting shortly. 
   In order to answer that question, however, we must, it seems to me, first deal with two prerequisites and vital questions. 
   First, what are our American objectives in Yugoslavia? And are they so vital to our national interest as to warrant a full-scale war? 
   Second, do we have a sufficient degree of confidence in the quality of our Presidential leadership to give the President unlimited and unrequested authority to pursue those objectives? 
   In connection with that first question, our American objectives, we are now engaged in an experiment, a venture, that is an entirely new function for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--not defensive in nature, but reaching outside of its own borders to attempt to settle one among many ethnic and religious conflicts around the world. 
   In my view, at the time at which we began this adventure, it was clearly not a vital interest to the United States of America. In addition to the absence of any vital national interest was the appalling lack of contingency plans on the part of the administration, as explained to Members of the Senate of both parties in the days leading up to the beginning of the bombing--no contingency plans as to what took place if the first two stages of bombing in a week or 10 days or 2 weeks was unsuccessful; no recognition of the high possibility or probability of extensive Serb atrocities in Kosovo aimed at the very people our actions were designed to protect. 
   In summary, Madam President, I believe that the administration's position at the beginning of this conflict ranked somewhere between frivolity and folly and, therefore, I was one of 41 Senators to vote against ratifying what we all knew the administration was going to do whatever the vote in the Senate. 
   On the other hand, as critical as I am of both the inception of this conflict and of its conduct, it is very difficult, I think impossible, to avoid the conclusion that what was not a vital national interest in the first place now involves a far greater national interest resulting from a flawed concept and a worse execution. 
   We now do implicate the very survival of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And our actions have precipitated a refugee crisis unmatched in Europe since the end of World War II. Well over a million Kosovars are homeless, many of them refugees outside of the boundaries of the Republic of Yugoslavia, all of them far worse off when they are not dead than they were before our intervention began. 
   Having recognized this, however, what are the possible outcomes? All of them, it seems to me, are bad. 
   The first is that we quit and come home. And some advocate that. I no longer honestly can do so as much as I opposed the beginning of this conflict. 
   The other and perhaps best possibility is that our air attacks may still be successful, that Milosevic and the Serbs may still give up, in which case  we get to occupy an absolutely devastated and destroyed Kosovo for perhaps a quarter of a century, and receive a bill to rebuild Kosovo, and maybe Serbia as well, some of which we may attempt with greater or lesser success to pass over on our allies, 
   and will now have to support the independence of that country. Its residents can no longer live with Serbia at all. That independence and that occupation, in my view, are the only way we will persuade Kosovar Albanians to return to their homes. 
   The next alternative, of course, is the Russian compromise --defeat, disguised as a form of compromise. The Kosovars under those circumstances, without an American occupation, with a Russian occupation, will almost certainly by the hundreds of thousands be rightly frightened to return to their homes. Such a compromise is likely to end up in a partition, in which Serbia ends up with far more of Kosovo than it deserves, given its actions. 
   However, that is now a course of action advocated by the previous speaker and by many others--defeat disguised as compromise. 
   Finally, we have the McCain resolution, a ground war led by this administration, which has already shown itself incompetent to run even an air war, and a 19-member steering committee--a prescription for total disaster. 
   What about the second question, the inevitable question of the quality of our national leadership? By its own criteria, the administration has been a total failure. It has not protected the Kosovars; it has not prevented a spread of the war. Its leadership is all spin, no recognition of its own difficulties, no willingness to explain to the people of the United States what it is all about or where we are going. We can have no confidence in either the preparation of this administration or the conduct of its operations. 
   We get to the ultimate question. We are asked by this resolution to grant unlimited authority to wage war in Yugoslavia to an administration unwilling to use that authority and incompetent to carry it out if it were willing.

   Mr. GORTON. As a consequence, what might be an appropriate response to an administration that sought it, that expressed its goals coherently enough to define what winning was, and competent to reach its goals, is totally inappropriate to grant to this administration--unasked, unwilling, and unable to carry on a war of this importance.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this week's Innovation in Education Award recipient is a remarkable school, Liberty Elementary, in Marysville, Washington. With help from school staff and led by Principal Paula Jones, Liberty Elementary's students have made outstanding advances in their reading performance. 
   Historically, this school has not shown great success in student standardized test results. To improve those results, the school's staff researched proven ``best practices'' for improving student reading. The staff eventually selected a program called ``Success For All'' that focuses on early intervention and personal attention to promote literacy. 
   Liberty Elementary's parents and staff recognized that in order for this program to succeed, they needed to be closely involved. So the parents and staff established ``Family Fun Night'' each month to educate families on the importance of reading, the benefits of education reform, and how to feel more comfortable as active partners in their children's education. Liberty's staff attends these family activities without extra compensation. The staff has also teamed up with local businesses to help acknowledge outstanding participation and achievement by students and parents. 
   Two years ago, Liberty teachers, parents, and students decided to refocus their efforts on reading. Now 80% of the students are reading at current grade level and above--a tremendous increase of 58%. Students at Liberty are now proud and successful readers thanks to the hard work of the Liberty staff and the support from their devoted parents and community. 
   What is noteworthy about Liberty is that the students became better readers because the community became more involved with its children. This Innovation in Education award is another example of how local communities really do know best. Local educators and parents work with our children every day and know what needs improvement. They deserve our support and should have more decision-making authority over how federal education dollars are to be spent. Educators from Washington state and from across the country need and deserve more flexibility and more control over their classrooms. Liberty Elementary and schools like it are the reasons why I will fight to return that power to our local schools where it belongs.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a constant theme heard in the economic  news of our country is the dramatic success and sustained growth of our nation's economy. My own state of Washington has been particularly fortunate in that regard, even give the much-talked about ``Asian flu.'' Not all of Washington's communities, however, have been so lucky. Among those is Aberdeen, in Grays Harbor County. Unemployment in Aberdeen is double the state average; over 17 percent of the county depends on public assistance as a primary source of income; and 27 percent of the adult population has not completed high school. To combat these issues, the Aberdeen School District and Grays Harbor Community College came together in 1993 to create the World Class Scholars program which I am pleased to present with one of my Innovation in Education Awards. 
   Recognizing that students were struggling to finish their education and would therefore be unqualified for many of the well paying technology-based jobs in Washington state, local educators created a new path to reach these workers of tomorrow--the World Class Scholars Program. The school district and community college agreed that students in the scholars program would automatically be accepted into the local community college, receive scholarship assistance and college credit for college-level work completed in high school. In return, students must follow through on a pledge made in the 7th grade to graduate with a ``B'' average. Students in the program also agree to demonstrate leadership and other interpersonal skills, volunteer at school or in the community, and become technologically proficient. This is exactly the kind of jump-start this community needed to encourage students to complete their education and to ensure that recent graduates have the tools necessary to compete for today's high-paying jobs. 
   Each year, the number of students and volunteers involved in the World Class Scholars program continues to grow. But, perhaps of great mention, the number of other school districts participating throughout the county in collaboration with Grays Harbor Community College has also grown. In two years, the first class of high school students will graduate and the community's pledge to provide them with continued education will be honored. Clearly, Aberdeen and surrounding school districts have needs that are different, perhaps unique, from other localities throughout Washington state. They have met this problem head on and are well on the way to making their community a better place to live. The response of the Grays Harbor community perfectly demonstrates that local educators really do know best. 
   In presenting my Innovation in Education Awards, I fall back on this common-sense idea, that it is parents and educators the who look our children in the eye every day that know best how to educate them. For too long, the federal government has been telling local schools that Washington, DC bureaucrats know best. Educators across Washington state and throughout the country, like those involved in the World Class Scholars program, deserve more decision-making authority they deserve and I pledge to work hard to return that power to them.

   Mr. GORTON. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act. This legislation will ensure that transportation workers who toil away on our nation's waterways receive the same tax treatment afforded their peers who work on the nation's highways, railroads, or navigate the skies. 
   Truck drivers, railroad personnel, and airline personnel are currently  covered by the Interstate Commerce Act, which exempts their income from double taxation. Water carriers, who work on tugboats or ships, were not included in the original legislation. This treatment is patently unfair. The Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act will rectify this situation by extending the same tax treatment to personnel who work on the navigable waters of more than one state. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will have no impact on the federal treasury. This measure simply allows those who work our navigable waterways protection from double taxation. 
   This matter came to my attention through a series of constituent letters from Columbia River tug boat operators who are currently facing taxation from Oregon as well as Washington state. I am committed to pursuing this avenue of relief for my constituents, as well as hard working tug boat operators across the nation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, dam removal as a serious option for salmon recovery on the Snake River died last week. It was killed by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the arm of the Clinton administration assigned to save those endangered salmon. 
   Why and how? 
   Three runs of salmon on the upper Snake River were listed as endangered in 1991 and 1992. On April 14, NMFS announced its determination that only 19 percent of salmon smolts barged around the dams, die. In fact, we now know that downriver survival rates are at least as high as they were in the 1960's before the Snake River dams were built! 
   As a result, NMFS now believes that the chance of recovery for the endangered runs is only 64 percent if all four Snake River dams are removed, as against 53 percent by continuing to transport smolts around the dams. The difference is barely statistically significant. 
   We can assume that NMFS science is the best available. That science is a vital component of public policy, but only one component of good public policy and not absolutely determinative to the exclusion of all other concerns. 
   So against the modest 11-percent improvement in survival chances for these populations of salmon from dam removal, we must weigh the immense costs of removal. Earlier this month at a Senate Energy Committee field hearing, a representative from Bonneville Power testified that BPA would lose approximately $263 million in power revenues in each average water year in perpetuity under medium future economic conditions. BPA also estimates that removal of the four lower Snake River dams is likely to increase its power rates by as much as 30 percent. The cost of removal itself, the destruction of navigation, the loss of irrigated farms and the human and community devastation add untold billions to that figure. That cost is vastly out of proportion to the salmon recovery goal, much less to the extremely modest improvement even in the prospects for recovery. 
   So dam removal as a rational option is dead. We in the Pacific Northwest, specifically residents in eastern, rural Washington, have been waging this war with the environmental community. It gives me great pleasure today to present my assessment of the recently released National Marine Fisheries Service report on Snake River dams and salmon recovery options. 
   I cannot support the effort to dismantle the world's most productive hydroelectric system when the costs are so great in relation to the benefit to a few selected salmon runs. Under the current management of the Columbia/Snake River system, Northwest ratepayers have contributed $366 million per year on average since 1995 to salmon recovery. The plan requires flow augmentation, dam spill, surface bypass, juvenile and adult fish passage improvements, water supply studies, PIT tag monitoring, and additional salmon barges. Although many, myself included, have been highly critical of Federal salmon recovery efforts, the results are beginning to show signs of progress. Based on new technology for salmon monitoring using Pit-Tags, NMFS estimates a significant increase in downriver survival for juvenile salmon. It estimates salmon are now surviving at a rate of 50 to 68 percent for juvenile salmon that migrate through eight Snake and Columbia River dams. Since about 60 percent of juvenile salmon are barged at a survival rate of 98 percent, the combined salmon survival rate to Portland, past eight dams, exceeds 80 percent. 
   Why are some in such a rush to consider dam removal when faced with these statistics? According to NMFS, these statistics may be further enhanced during the next three to four years of monitoring the adult fish returning to the river. However, the single-interest advocacy groups claim we can't wait any longer--they say we must remove the dams now. 
   Let me reemphasize one glaring fact. The overall survival rate past the four lower Snake dams is at least as high today as it was in the 1960's before the dams were built, according to NMFS' own biologists. Much of this recent improvement in survival rates can be attributed to technical and operational improvements at the dams. There is much more that can be done to improve survival rates past the four lower Snake dams. Unfortunately, the Army Corps of Engineers has been waiting to see if these dams are going to be removed before spending any more money on further improvements that could provide immediate benefits. 
   Although the passage survival is much higher now, adult salmon returns continue at a distressed level. A likely theory is that declines are due to the rise in ocean temperatures. During the Easter recess, my Interior appropriations subcommittee held a field hearing on Northwest salmon recovery in Seattle. One of NMFS' own fisheries biologists expressed optimism that the likelihood of decreasing ocean temperatures off the coast in the Pacific Northwest as indicative of an improving climate for salmon in the Northwest. 
   We are likely to obtain valuable new information about adult salmon returns and likely will witness a dramatic change in the ocean environment. Even under current circumstances, the difference between removing 
   dams, to save fish or barging them around dams is too close to call. And when all the costs of dam removal are factored into this equation, it is hard to imagine why anyone would want to take this dubious course of action. 
   In the meantime, the debate over dam removal has led to unfortunate consequences. More realistic and cost effective salmon recovery measures with a proven track record have been delayed. I am committed to securing the funds necessary not only for dam improvements but also for local salmon enhancement groups and other conservation organizations to continue their efforts to restore salmon habitat throughout the state. Salmon recovery will take place when local people who care passionately about local watersheds have the freedom and the resources to take the steps needed on a stream-by-stream and river-by-river basis. 
   At my recent field hearing, I was most impressed with the way people in my state are coming together in unprecedented ways. Rather than focusing on past differences, farmers, loggers, fishermen, conservationists, locally elected officials, and countless others representing a vast array of interests and perspectives are working together to develop habitat restoration and watershed improvement plans throughout the state that will not only provide immediate benefits to our salmon resource but will do so in ways that will take into consideration the economic and social needs of our communities. 
   A good example of how collaborative efforts can achieve positive results for the salmon resource recently took place in the Hanford Reach area of the Columbia River. Ten years ago, the fall  chinook stock in the Hanford Reach was in bad shape. Now it is the most abundant of the wild Columbia River stocks. This is due largely to the efforts of the Grant County Public Utility District which led the effort to reach an agreement that protects the fish by regulating river flows from the time the adults spawn to the time the juveniles emerge from the gravel. 
   Last year, biologists discovered juvenile chinook were stranded after emerging from the gravel. Grant County PUD again led discussions involving all review mid-Columbia hydroelectric projects, together with federal, state, and tribal fishery agencies to develop a program to reduce the number of young fish stranded because of river flow fluctuations. Implementing this agreement requires a substantial loss in valuable power generation, but represents an unprecedented example of how hydroelectric projects can work proactively and cooperatively with fishery management agencies to protect salmon. This model effort deserves our encouragement and support. 
   Clearly, the approach being taken by communities throughout my state is far preferable to the divisive one being advocated by those who want to rip out dams in the Northwest. Rather than continuing down this misguided and confrontational course which will cost more and provide no assurances of enhanced recovery, I today call on dam removal advocates to abandon their cause, and to recognize the real implications of the NMFS report. If they are truly interested in restoring salmon, they will work with me and others in the mainstream who want to do something now positively to recover our salmon resource. 
   But Mr. President, we must keep in mind one important fact. Environmental bureaucrats in the Clinton-Gore administration have made it their standard operating procedure not to listen to what I, much less the region, thinks about dam removal. In fact, the Administration must have an unwritten rule somewhere not to pay attention to local people in the communities that would be destroyed by such action. It's alarming that while the region is increasingly united in its effort to preserve dams and the Northwest way of life, from the local level to the statehouse to our congressional delegation--the administration and the environmental community refuses to concede.

   Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I support legislation designed to avert and control what could be a litigation bonanza stemming from the Y2K problem. We can't be sure what computer-based system, if any, may go awry at midnight, December 31, 1999, but we should not sit by idly and wait to find out. The Y2K Act attempts proactively to provide incentives for everyone, potential plaintiffs and defendants alike, to cure Y2K compliance problems before they occur and to impose reasonable limits on liability and rules for the prosecution of lawsuits arising from Y2K failures. 
   On today's editorial page, the New York Times criticizes Senator MCCAIN's Y2K legislation and opines that:  
   Congress can also clarify the liability of companies once it becomes clear how widespread the problem really is. But before the new year, the government should not use the millennium bug to overturn longstanding liability practices. I strongly disagree. We know that our current liability system, longstanding as it may be, is flawed in that it increasingly lends itself to lawsuits of limited merit, but huge downside risks, excessive delays, and creative and often unfair theories of liability. Just as it is irresponsible for people not to take remedial action to avoid the Y2K problem, it would be irresponsible for Congress not to fix our litigation system with respect to its handling of this specific issue, to deal with the flood of potential cases and the enormous, possibly destructive, burden that litigation can impose on potential defendants. Of particular concern to me are the smaller high-technology companies that have been thriving in Washington State and across the Nation. I have met with and heard from numerous representatives from these companies. To them, the threat of abusive litigation is not speculative or illusory; it is real and potentially fatal.  
   Senator MCCAIN's substitute to S. 96, of which I am a cosponsor, is an improvement in some respects to the bill that we passed out of the Commerce Committee, not in the least because this substitute enjoys bipartisan support. Notably, the substitute modifies the provisions in S. 96 on punitive damages and joint liability. While S. 96 established strict caps on punitive damages, the substitute permits these caps to be pierced if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff. The absolute prohibition on joint liability originally contained in S. 96 has also been modified. 
   The substitute roughly tracks the exceptions to joint liability limits contained in the 1995 securities litigation reform legislation. Rather than to prohibit joint liability in 
   all cases, the substitute permits joint liability, subject to State limits, in situations in which plaintiffs' assets are limited and damages exceed 10 percent of those assets; in situations in which damages cannot be recovered against another defendant; and against defendants who acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff or who knowingly committed fraud. 
   Madam President, these changes have been made by Senator MCCAIN in a genuine effort to see to it that the broad appeal of this bill becomes even broader. 
   In addition to modifying the limitations on punitive damages and joint liability, the substitute, among other changes, strikes the provision in S. 96 that created the defense for those using reasonable efforts to prevent Y2K problems; modifies the circumstances under which the terms of a written contract will be enforced by recognizing State statutes that limit enforcement of certain terms, and expands the exceptions to the economic loss rule. 
   Madam President, these are not simple legal concepts. While I think S. 96 has benefitted from more deliberative review by interested parties representing potential plaintiffs and defendants alike, I am still not convinced that the substitute has achieved the precisely correct balance of promoting remedial action, effectively curtailing abusive lawsuits, and not simply changing the way in which plaintiffs plead their cases, and ensuring that plaintiffs have adequate recourse for damages. I nevertheless wholeheartedly support Y2K liability legislation because I believe it is our responsibility to prevent foreseeable litigation that could clog our State and Federal courts and divert enormous resources away from production and toward litigation. The Senate should pass Y2K liability legislation and should do so as soon as possible. I expect that the bill can be further refined and improved during floor debate and again in conference. 
   I want to add to my formal written remarks my admiration for the tremendous amount of effort that the chairman of the Commerce Committee has put into attempting to see to it that we here end up with a bill that becomes law, even though it requires a number of compromises, rather than simply to become another item of debate and division. 
   Tort reform, product liability legislation, and medical malpractice legislation are all important national issues, but they are all extremely divisive. In this case, for this particular form of litigation, which has no precedent in the United States, reform is genuinely needed. The Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, has brought us a long way along the right road, and I have every confidence that we will finish with success.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, under the order of last night, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin debate on the conference report to accompany the education flexibility bill. By previous order, there are 3 hours of debate on the conference report, and a vote can be expected at the conclusion or yielding back of that time. 
   On Tuesday, a cloture motion was filed on the lockbox amendment to S. 557. Therefore, Senators should expect that cloture vote on Thursday. As a reminder, pursuant to rule XXII, second-degree amendments must be filed 1 hour prior to a vote on cloture. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I seek recognition in my own right. I believe the remarks I am about to make are more proper from my own desk than from the majority leader's.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Congress is about to be asked to appropriate $10 billion, and perhaps more, in emergency funds to finance a war in the Balkans and to help the refugees that war has created. We will be asked to do so after a brief debate and with no opportunity to impose conditions or to add reservations. That is the wrong way to deal with so grave an issue. 
   On March 23, the Senate authorized air attacks on Yugoslavia in the hope that they would motivate the Government of Yugoslavia to grant autonomy to the Kosovars, a status far less than the independence they seek, enforced by the presence of American and other NATO troops for an undefined period of time, and thus to prevent a refugee crisis. We have been spectacularly unsuccessful at attaining either goal. 
   I voted against the March resolution. I did so because I believe that the United States should engage in armed conflict only when its vital interests are at stake, and that the then Serb repression of the Kosovar Albanians did not involve any of our vital national interests. 
   My vote was also motivated by the belief that the limited bombing proposed would be unlikely to help us reach the dubious goal of occupying Kosovo. When we do engage our Armed Forces in conflict, we should do so decisively and with overwhelming force aimed at the cause of the conflict--in this case, the Milosevic government in Belgrade. 
   This conflict, to the contrary, was begun in too limited a fashion to be likely to bring the Serbs to heel, with no contingency plans should the early bombing not work, and with no anticipation of the brutal Serb reaction in driving hundreds of thousands of Kosovars out of home and country. 
   It is that failure that brings us to our present state. The President will not acknowledge our failure to reach his goals, will not speak seriously to the American people about both ends and means, and will not ask Congress to authorize him to act decisively and to support him in doing so. Instead, we  are engaged in a conflict in which the primary goal seems to be to avoid American casualties, the secondary goal to avoid Serbian casualties. So the only real casualties are among the Kosovar Albanians, the people the conflict was designed to protect. 
   The President will not, and should not, send our troops into Kosovo and won't arm the Kosovo rebels so they can defend themselves. We bomb buildings that we are certain are empty but not television towers or airports. We bomb oil storage depots but allow oil tankers to unload replacement oil within sight of our fleet. 
   At this point, of course, a conflict over an issue that was not vital to our national security in the beginning has now escalated to one that is, both with respect to the refugees and to the survival of NATO itself, all due to the frivolous and half-hearted nature of our military operations. In the abstract, this fact lays weight to the arguments of Senators LUGAR and MCCAIN, among others, to lift the artificial and self-defeating renunciation of ground operations. 
   But their arguments flounder disastrously with the first whiff of reality. This is a war run by committee. A dozen politicians from almost as many countries must sign off on targets even with respect to the air war. The United States has not even sought NATO consent to arm the Kosovars and to blockade Yugoslavia. 
   Does any Senator believe for a moment that this administration will wage or is capable of waging a real war with victory as its goal? No. 
   We have only four realistic alternatives, all unpalatable. First, there is the remote hope that Milosevic will surrender and agree to our demands. Under those circumstances, we would get to occupy Kosovo for perhaps 25 years. Second, we may quit and go home, leaving chaos in our wake. Third, the most likely outcome now is a settlement brokered by the Russians in which the 90 percent of Albanian Kosovars get the poorest half of a devastated province and the 10 percent Serb Kosovars get the best half. We will then be asked to rebuild Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, and probably Serbia as well. President Clinton will proclaim this a victory. 
   The fourth and last alternative is a gradual escalation of the air war, followed by gradual escalation on the ground, without any prospect of real victory but at a very real cost in American lives and the expenditure of billions of American dollars. 
   Each of these alternatives, Mr. President, is a terrible disservice to the brave American men and women who are loyally fighting this war and who deserve better from our leaders. Each is a tragedy for the hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians rooted out of destroyed homes, turned into impoverished refugees or killed outright. 
   It is those prospects that the Senate should be debating, using such time as is proportionate to the seriousness of the issues. 
   But we are now faced with the prospect of a $12 billion add-on to a $2 billion supplemental appropriations bill, with little opportunity for debate and no opportunity to amend or condition that appropriation. What should have been an occasion for a serious debate will become instead a venture in avoiding the responsibility to ask and to answer hard questions. 
   That is a game the Senate should not play. At the very least, we should allow those who propose intervention on the ground an opportunity to make their case, and those of us who wish to arm the rebels a chance to make ours. 
   An appropriation covering the cost of this conflict until October without seriously debated conditions is a blank check to the President to conduct the conflict as he pleases. It is all the authorization for war on the ground he is ever likely to seek. It is a total abdication of our responsibilities. I cannot support such an action. I will do all I can to defeat it.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note with great pleasure the prayer this morning was given by Father Mackay, the rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Kirkland, WA. That is the church I most frequently attend when I am in my home State, and I attend it because of his great qualities as a pastor and a leader of his congregation. The magnificent spiritual guidance he gives both individually and collectively to that congregation makes it one of the most satisfying and religiously exciting churches that it has ever been my privilege to attend during a 
   relatively long life. 
   He is here, however, not by my invitation but at the invitation of my friend and colleague from Montana, Senator BURNS. Father Mackay hails from Montana. His brother, I believe, is State director for Senator BURNS, and it was his imagination and thoughtfulness that invited Don here today. I thank him. I thank our regular Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie, and I thank Father Mackay for a wonderful and inspiring prayer.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during this past recess, I had the pleasure of presenting my Innovation in Education Awards to two excellent recipients, one of which I would like to recognize now. 
   One award was given to the ``Steps Ahead'' program from ``Community for Youth.'' Community for Youth is a local non-profit organization in Seattle whose Steps Ahead program provides adult mentors to youth at risk of academic or social failure. This program has been in existence for eight years and has demonstrated remarkable progress in transforming the lives of students who might otherwise fall through the cracks of our education system. 
   Steps Ahead's curriculum focuses on five key factors for student behavior: (1) Building a positive self-image, (2) Expressing themselves assertively rather than passively or aggressively, (3) Accepting responsibility for their behavior rather than making excuses, (4) Setting and keeping realistic goals in life and (5) Making conscious decisions to solve problems rather than reactively letting the world pass them by. These may seem like exceedingly basic principles but, this focus has reaped great rewards with the students it has reached. 
   The students involved in this program have, for whatever reason been labeled as ``at-risk.'' Fortunately, through the simple concept of restoring self-respect, accountability, and confidence, the Steps Ahead program has achieved outstanding results. Steps Ahead participants have fewer dropouts and fewer expulsions from school than their peers. The Steps Ahead students also have ten percent better classroom attendance, twenty-five percent fewer grades, and fifteen percent fewer dropouts, expulsions and long term suspensions--all this is the heart of metropolitan Seattle where the escourge of dropouts rates, poor attendance, and violent behavioral problems have traditionally been some of the worst in Washington state. 
   Community for Youth's efforts thought the Steps Ahead program is just one piece of the puzzle of trying to improve the lives and education of troubled youth. More importantly, perhaps, Steps Ahead has accomplished these feats by teaming up with local business to provide funding and mentors and by teaming up with the Seattle School District to target school populations most in need of mentoring. This type of common-sense and community-oriented approach to solving a difficult education problem demonstrates the exact reason why I began this Innovation in Education Award program. 
   I think any of my colleagues would be hard pressed to prove the kind of program I am talking about here today could come from the innovation of a bureaucrat here in Washington, DC. Rather, it is the hard work of the people that look into the eyes of our children every day, the parents, the teachers, the school administrators, and the volunteers like those at Steps Ahead, who make a difference in the lives of our children. 
   I am pleased to have been able to recognize Steps Ahead and Community For Youth with an Innovation in Education Award. They represent the  ideals in education that deserve our support.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during this past recess, I had the pleasure of presenting Innovation in Education Awards to two excellent recipients; the first of which I noted in a previous floor speech. 
   The second Innovation in Education Award went to Peggy O'Neill-Skinner, a truly remarkable science teacher at the Bush School in Seattle. Peggy has been a science teacher for 28 years and is doing outstanding work in helping her students learn the importance of biology and technology in today's world. Her years of devotion in teaching AP Biology, general biology, and numerous elective science courses have shown great dividends. In fact, at a larger education event at which this award was presented, my staff was approached by a number of attendees who had one universally similar point to share: ``my child went to Bush and Peggy is a truly remarkable teacher. She is the kind of teacher that can change a student's life and is a perfect fit for this award.'' Such praise needs no elaboration. 
   Last December, Peggy was given the prestigious Siemens Award for Advance Placement, one of only 20 award winners across the country. The Siemens Award recognizes excellence AP courses for math and science. By virtue of being selected with such a small number of her peers to receive such  recognition, Peggy's own accomplishments speak to her supererogatory nature. 
   Her devotion to her students and to pursuing her own continued education has paid great dividends with her students. Indeed, she spends her own summers teaching and learning at the University of Washington as well as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It is this kind of effort--to be the best possible educator one can be--that makes the education of all our children better. 
   I am pleased to have been able to give Peggy an Innovation in Education Award in recognition of her hard work, her dedication, and her devotion to making the lives of her students better. While Peggy teaches in a private school, she clearly demonstrates the common sense that permeates local educators in all of our constituencies. They can do amazing things if we make sure they have the resources to do so without the red tape that would otherwise stifle the learning of our children. 
   For too long the federal government has been in the business of placing burdensome regulations on our local schools. We have in Peggy O'Neill-Skinner an example of what educators can do without those restraints and we owe it to our children and grandchildren to let educators like Peggy reach their potential. That is why I will continue to fight hard on behalf of legislation that provides relief from red tape and brings more money into local classrooms where the people with real common sense to educate our children work everyday.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as my colleagues may remember, each week I give an Innovation in Education Award to recognize outstanding educators and education programs in Washington State. The premise is very simple, that local people in our communities, not bureaucrats here in Washington, DC, know best how to educate our children. 
   As nominations for these awards have poured into my office, I received one noting the work of the program I will recognize today: the Tri-City Crystal Apple Awards. The Crystal Apple Awards is sponsored by local service groups, businesses, and individuals. The community comes together to recognize educators who have a positive impact on the lives and futures of their students. 
   Each educator nominated for this award has demonstrated that he or she has a special focus on students, has enthusiasm and versatility in meeting individual needs, creativity in their use of curriculum and resources, give special attention to creating a constructive learning environment, have the ability to develop parent support and respect, and have the ability to inspire students so the student may achieve their maximum potential in life. These are truly outstanding characteristics for any educator to have. 
   I commend the Crystal Apple Award program for recognizing the excellence that occurs in their midst. Too often today, educators of great merit go without recognition. Indeed, currently there is a heated debate occurring in Washington State regarding teacher pay and methods to improve compensation for these deserving educators. The Crystal Apple Awards are doing the right thing in teaming up with the community to recognize the people that are making the difference in their local schools. My only regret is that I am not able to be in Richland for the awards presentation. 
   I hope that the attendees of the Crystal Apple Awards ceremony will have a pleasant event. I hope too that my colleagues will recognize the excellence in education found in communities across our country. This issue energizes me in a special way. I am glad to stand up for what the educators in my State have wanted for a long time: the freedom to innovate. That is why I will work hard this year to allow local communities to decide how to best spend their Federal education dollars; giving people like the recipients of the Crystal Apple Awards the flexibility to teach our kids the way they--and only they--know best.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as the majority has as I may utilize. 
   Mr. President, here in the Congress of the United States, this April 15 can be a day for modest congratulations for us. We will have passed a budget resolution on the day mandated by the Budget Act for only the second time in more than 2 decades. 
   Moreover, we will be adopting a budget resolution that balances the budget not only for the 1 year in which it is firmly binding, fiscal year 2000, but we hope for at least a decade to come. 
   We will be adopting a budget resolution that does more to secure the future of our Social Security safety net than has any budget resolution since the Budget Act itself was passed, first, by assuring that the entire Social Security surplus is used to pay down the debt and not to be spent on a wide range of other matters, as was recommended by the President's budget itself and, second, by calling for a lockbox to see to it that the condition of preventing the Social Security surplus being used for any other purpose is permanent and not temporary only. 
   Second, this budget resolution offers real tax relief to the American people. In that connection, it is especially appropriate that we will be adopting this budget resolution on time. 
   Today, of course, is tax day. April 15 is the day that the complexity and incomprehensibility of our mammoth Federal Tax Code hits home to almost every American. Today, my constituents in Washington State and, of course, citizens all across the United States rush to the post office, as I did myself this morning, to get their income tax postmarked on time. 
   I think it is appropriate to address my own hopes and the intentions of this budget resolution that this Congress will act on tax relief and perhaps begin to look forward to an even more fundamental tax reform. 
   Families whom I represent in the Northwest deserve a rebate from the Federal budget surplus in the form of tax relief, allowing them to decide how best to use their hard-earned dollars. I also believe that it is time to scrap the current Federal income tax code as being far too complicated, too burdensome, and too unfair. 
   Let me discuss for a few moments the reasons for providing tax relief to American taxpayers. I would like to share with the Senate a few telling facts about the nature of that tax burden today. 
   A recent Congressional Research Service study found that an average American family will pay $5,370 more in taxes over the course of the next 10 years than the Federal Government needs to operate under the budget resolution that we adopted just a year ago and this even after assuring that all our obligations to Social Security and Medicare have been met. 
   Next, the Independent Tax Foundation found that this year Americans on average will work 129 days to pay off their total tax bill imposed at Federal, State, and local levels, while my Washington State taxpayers will have to work even longer, 132 days on average. 
   Third, American workers now pay more in Federal, State, and local taxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined. 
   And fourth, the Federal Government collects more in taxes than ever before, currently nearly 21 percent of America's gross domestic product, the highest percentage since World War II. 
   These are simply facts, not arguments. Reasonable people can agree that Americans are having to turn over too much of their hard-earned dollars in taxes. Tax relief is not a question of need, it is a question of justice. Is it right and just for citizens from Wenatchee to Woodinville to Walla Walla to work more than a third of the year just to pay their taxes? I think not. 
   Unfortunately, President Clinton and his Vice President GORE proposed in their budget to increase--that is right, a net increase in taxes of $96 billion over the next 10 years. You might wonder why a President and Vice President want to raise taxes when we already have the highest burden since World War II. Why do they want to raise taxes when the Federal budget is operating in a surplus? It should be no surprise considering that ever since they were sworn into office in 1993, they have not proposed a net tax cut. In spite of the fact that President Clinton and Vice 
   President GORE campaigned in 1992 on the promise of a middle-class tax cut, they ignored that promise and promptly increased taxes by as much as any administration in the history of the United States. 
   Why? It is very simple. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton proposed 77 new Federal programs. Why does this administration believe that the Government needs to spend more money on so many new programs? Because the President and the Vice President do not trust the American people to spend their own money wisely. They believe that they can spend it better. 
   I disagree. To the taxpayers in towns across my State and across the United States, I say that the Republicans who are adopting this budget do so because they trust you and your family and your neighbors better to spend your own money on your own needs and priorities than bureaucrats in Washington, DC, will ever be able to do. 
   This is one reason that I so strongly favor this budget. This budget sets aside every penny of the Federal budget surplus generated from Social Security into a lockbox for the purpose of strengthening that Social Security system for the future, but it provides that we will return any additional surpluses in the form of tax reductions, up to $142 billion over the next 5 years and $778 billion over ten years, to the people who have paid those taxes. 
   What form of tax relief are we talking about? I must confess that I do not know. Congress will debate that later this year. Four major proposals, however, are: eliminating the marriage tax penalty, ending or reducing the death tax, reducing capital gains taxes, and an across-the-board cut in income tax rates. 
   While I certainly am not able to predict what the final tax relief bill will look like, I hope that it will include some elements of all four of these proposals. But the important point is that this budget resolution allows that debate to take place, allows the Congress to permit the American people to spend their own money, return it to them in the form of tax relief, as against the proposal of the President and the Vice President to increase taxes so that they can determine where that money is spent. 
   I must also say, incidentally, at least that I am every bit as committed to replacing our current Federal income tax code as I am to reducing that tax burden. It is time to scrap it. It is too complicated, too burdensome, too unfair. We need to focus our attention in Congress on developing an alternative. That alternative needs to be fair, simple, uniform and consistent. It is that support on my part that has led me to cosponsor the Tax Code Termination Act. The bill would sunset the current income tax code, except for those funding mechanisms for Social Security and Medicare, by December 31 of the year 2002. It would require a simple majority vote by Congress to reinstate the current code if agreement on a replacement code cannot be reached. But the real points are two: It makes absolutely certain the need to scrap the current Tax Code, and it will act as a catalyst to jump-start debate on a new one. 
   Mr. President, Americans deserve a Tax Code they can understand and predict. Today, about the only thing Americans can predict about the Tax Code is that they will send a big check off to Uncle Sam by April 15, and about the only thing they understand is that the IRS will find them if they do not. 
   This should change, and it is why I am working to help pass a tax relief bill and why I will be working in favor of a new Federal Tax Code that is fair, simple, uniform, and consistent. But a true debate on tax relief, a chance to  say exactly what it is we want, depends on a budget resolution which calls for or requires it. 
   This budget resolution does so, Mr. President. This budget resolution is on time. This budget resolution says to the American people: We will secure Social Security for you; we will balance the budget so the economy can keep growing; but the money that is not needed to meet the requirements of the agreements that we made a year ago or 2 years ago is going to be returned to you in the form of tax relief. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on the Tuesday before the recess, I voted against authorizing the air war in Yugoslavia. I did so because it seemed to me that the goal was a goal not worthy enough, not grave enough to begin what amounts to a war, even though under the President's leadership it has only been half a war. 
   Our goals were to be permitted to send young American men and women into the midst of a 600-year-old civil strife in order to enforce an agreement that neither side wished. I also voted against that proposition, because it did not seem to me that the means were sufficient to gain even this questionable end. I voted against it, because it did not seem to me that the administration began to foresee the terrible consequences that would ensue if, and as President Milosevic has, accelerated his expulsion of Kosovars from their own homeland, or the refugee problem with which we would be faced. In other words, there were no contingency plans. 
   At this point, almost 3 weeks later, all of those negative consequences have transpired. We are in the midst of an air war. The air war has not been successful. It is being fought apparently  by a President who believes that one can have a war not only without casualties on our side but with few, if any, casualties on the other side. You should not begin a war for reasons that do not justify the use of force, and only the gravest national security reasons do so. And, if you get in one, you should not go into it halfheartedly or without a desire actually to win. 
   Mr. President, what are the potential outcomes? If we are overwhelmingly successful, we may get sometime in the next week, 
   or the next month, or the next year, exactly the privileges that we sought in the first place--the right to send our soldiers into a now devastated countryside in order to require people to live together who do not wish to live together, and perhaps to enforce an autonomy, which I have already said both sides oppose, or, alternatively, maybe we can get the Russians or someone else to help us reach a negotiated solution in which the Kosovars will be worse off than they were before, and in which the barbarism of Mr. Milosevic will at least have been partially rewarded. Or we may end up sending our own troops into that devilishly difficult part of the Balkans, whether from the south, or the west and the north--and we do not yet know--with an escalation of what will still be a halfhearted war with secondary goals, goals that will not include the removal of the present government in Belgrade and the establishment of a real peace. Or, I suppose it is possible--just remotely possible--that the President and NATO may decide that we want a full-scale war against Serbia until that regime is, in fact, destroyed. 
   None of these is an appetizing outcome, by any stretch of the imagination. We are left with these alternatives only, I think, because this administration did not seriously consider what it was doing before it began doing it, or seriously consider both the cost and expense in men, material, money, and prestige of the United States for such a dubious goal. 
   I wish that I had a firm, accurate, and a favorable outcome to look forward to. I wish I could come up with the appropriate means to reach such a goal. However, it seems to me that if we have learned anything in the last several years from other parts of the world, and in the last several weeks from this part of the world, it is that the armed services of the United States should only be used for a vitally important interest of the United States. If they are then to be used, they should be used with a clear and worthy goal, and with a degree of ruthlessness that assures we attain that goal. At this point we have done nothing but worsen our relationships with the Russians and with the neighbors of Kosovo itself at great expense to ourselves and at a horrendous expense to the victims in Kosovo who have been killed, driven from their homes, or driven out of their homeland entirely, without any significant prospect of returning at any time soon. 
   We do need a serious national debate on the subject and we need a President of the United States who far more clearly articulates our goals and how we are to attain those goals. We have not had that kind of presentation. For that reason, support for the United States efforts is extremely shallow and is almost certain to disappear once the casualty lists begin to be published in this country. 
   It is time for candor. It is time for clarity. It is time for a clear statement of our goals. In fact, we are well past time for both of those and we have not received them. I think we are faced with an extremely serious challenge with no clear way to that proper and appropriate goal.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a school in Oak Harbor, Washington for their wonderful success in becoming a `school of choice.' Oak Harbor Elementary is another shining example for why I began my ``Innovation in Education Award'' program--to highlight to my colleagues in the good things that are happening in education at the local level. 
   When Oak Harbor Elementary underwent a massive remodel of its north annex, originally built in 1934, it had the opportunity to add 200 more students to its student body. Rather than change attendance boundary areas, the school board and superintendent saw it as an opportunity to make it a magnet school to draw students from the most crowded schools in the district. 
   Over the course of a year, Principal Glenda Merwine met with parents and staff to determine what the ideal elementary school could look like. After many meetings, surveys, and discussions, the school chose to make a series of reforms including: requiring uniforms for all students in grades K-5; including curriculum in every classroom about various positive character traits like honesty, generosity and integrity; requiring parent compacts for participation in their children's education; and eventually implementing strong fine arts programs. 
   With this innovative new structure, Oak Harbor Elementary attracted over 200 student transfers from other schools including private schools and home-schooled children in the area. 
   The Oak Harbor ``school of choice'' is now in its second semester under the new plan. Staff and parents are highly enthusiastic over the improved discipline, motivation and achievements of the entire student body. Ms. Merwine said she has seen a dramatic change in the students' attitudes. The student body at Oak Harbor Elementary has increased by 230, yet Ms. Merwine said suspensions and disciplinary incidents decreased dramatically. 
   She gave one example of how the uniforms have brought down artificial barriers between students. Last year, a kindergartener frequently asked Ms. Merwine or a teacher to play with her, claiming the other children wouldn't. Ms. Merwine eventually observed another student telling the girl she wouldn't play with her because she wasn't wearing the ``right brand of jeans.'' This year, on the first day of school, Ms. Merwine said she saw the same two girls--now in 1st grade and wearing nearly identical uniforms--happily playing in the school yard. 
   I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance educators like Glenda Merwine, and the exciting things happening in our local schools when they are given the freedom to innovate. I for one, want to do all I can to increase their flexibility and resources so local educators--our parents, teachers, principals, school board members and superintendents--can continue to make the best decisions about the education of our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is almost 35 years since Congress passed the first Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That marked a fundamental change in the relationship between the Federal Government and local school districts in the management of education policy. That act in 1965 was 30 pages long. Today the Elementary and Secondary Education Act takes up 400 pages of our statute books. The regulations passed pursuant to that act and other education acts literally occupy thousands of pages of the Federal regulations. 
   For a third of a century, Washington, DC--often Congress but most particularly the people who work in the Department of Education--has been dominated by the thought that centralized decisions and centralized control exercised here in Washington, DC, was the best way to solve problems relating to the education of our young people. 
   Mr. President, 35 years of that experience has been demonstrably shown not to work. Test scores have not improved anything like the degree that centralized control has been imposed from Washington, DC. In addition, of course, the Congress has not really kept its promise with respect to education. Only 7 or 8 percent of the money that our schools spend comes from appropriations from the Congress of the United States, but a good 50 percent of the rules and regulations do. A failed experiment should be abandoned, and we should try something else. 
   To focus on a particular incident in my own State of Washington, a team of researchers at the University of Washington found that it wasn't more money that improved test scores in 26 elementary schools in Seattle. It was better people and more freedom. The schools that showed the greatest improvements had principals who motivated teachers to work together, parents who cared and were involved, and the flexibility to do things differently among these various schools. Those principals had more control over the moneys that their schools spent, and it allowed them to custom build programs tailored to their particular school's needs. 
   The idea has caught on in my State to the point at which our Governor has proposed the creation of ``opportunity schools,'' school districts that would choose to send their funding directly to the schoolhouse and thus free themselves from many regulations at the State level. 
   This amendment, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, suggests that we here in Washington, DC, abandon the failed pattern of more and more Federal rules and regulations and repose more trust in parents, in teachers, in principals, and in elected school board members all across the United States. 
   My friend, the Senator from Missouri, dramatically illustrated how much more money goes into administration when you deal with Federal dollars than is the case with State dollars. He talked about the thousands of school employees throughout the United States who must occupy their time filling out Federal forms. We believe that we should provide more in the way of dollars to our students across the United States, and in fact, this budget resolution is far more generous than the budget proposed by the President of the United States, but we believe that we should impose far fewer controls with those dollars and impose more trust in those people who spend their full time caring about the education of our children. 
   In the Presiding Officer's State of Ohio and in mine, Washington State, and the State represented by the Senator from Missouri, the electors who were wise enough to elect us to this position are certainly wise enough to elect school board members who care passionately about the kids in their school districts and about the success of their education. 
   Later in this year, we will deal with the renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Then our voices and our votes will carry even more weight because we will be voting on real policies. In this budget resolution, however, we are making a promise of more resources for our schools and for our schoolchildren, and we should accompany that promise with the promise to trust our parents and teachers and principals and school board members to spend that money wisely.  
   The Senator from Missouri was very complimentary with respect to my efforts in this regard. Twice in the last 2 years the Senate has voted to move in exactly that direction. We have 
   not yet been successful. We have not gotten this all the way through Congress and past the President of the United States. In fact, the President's budget underfunds the programs that we have already established without removing the regulations that accompany those programs and establishes a whole new series of categorical programs in which we tell the schools what their priorities ought to be and how they ought to spend their money. 
   What does that do in the real world? The Seattle Times recently reported remarks by the superintendent of the Snoqualmie Valley School District, Rich McCullough, who said:  
   It's a little discouraging, but I think there is a lack of trust implicit in almost all Federal funding programs we deal with. They don't trust us to spend the money right, so they force us to do whatever they think is best. It's not always best for every school.  
   I think that Mr. McCullough knows more about what the students in the Snoqualmie Valley School District in Washington need and how the money he has should be spent on their education than does any Member of Congress, myself included, or any bureaucrat in the Department of Education in downtown Washington, DC. 
   Dwayne Slate, the executive director of the Washington State School Board, made a similar point in a recent letter that he wrote to me:  
   At some point elected officials in Washington, DC simply must trust local education officials to do what's in the best interests of kids in their communities. We all have their best interests at heart.  
   Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will follow that advice and will allow these superintendents, these 
   teachers, these parents, more in the way of decisionmaking authority as to the kids to whom they are devoting their lives and their careers. 
   I have every hope that the Senate will accept this amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina does have the virtue of consistency. He was one of three members of his party the night before last who voted against authorizing a war in Yugoslavia. And this budget resolution, among other things, does not raise the caps for national defense--a point that most Members feel is necessary after many years of shortchanging it. It does not permit any tax relief, it does not permit any change in priorities for education, as does the budget that is before us at the present time. 
   In fact, it is based on the proposition that the country is unchanged from where it was when we voted on the budget a year ago. I believe the budget that we have here today is preferable to the one we had a year ago, partly because for the last year we have been very, very successful. 
   But, clearly, we are going to need the flexibility to pay for something that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and the Presiding Officer and I voted against the other night which is going to have to be paid for at this point. And the only way to do so is to show the flexibility that this budget resolution does. 
   So I oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the provision in this budget resolution that the distinguished Senator from Illinois seeks to strike is there for one quite simple reason, and that is that while we have created a discipline for ourselves through spending caps, and while within those spending caps we are able to determine appropriations on the basis of a simple majority vote, Members have discovered that all they need to do is declare an ``emergency,'' whether one exists or not, and they are free from the budget caps, from the very spending discipline that has been central to our economic success over the course of the last 3 or 4 years. 
   As a consequence, the requirement that in order to declare an emergency, in order to spend money that is outside of the caps, in order, essentially, in this fiscal year to invade the Social Security surplus will require a modest supermajority. 
   Now, under those circumstances, Mr. President, that seems to me to be eminently reasonable. If there is a true emergency, won't 60 votes be available? The Senator from Illinois refers to our members of our Armed Forces in Yugoslavia. Now, Mr. President, it beggars belief to feel that 60 votes will not be able to support our Armed Forces when they are engaged in conflict. The same thing is going to be true with respect to any other emergency. But to allow spending limitations that a majority of the Senate has put into effect, spending limitations that are so important to our success, to be frivolously overridden and ignored simply by a 51-vote majority is not responsible budgeting. 
   This provision is there because of our experience in the last couple of years with the declaration of emergencies for emergency spending purposes. Mr. President, I am sure that, along with the chairman of the Budget Committee, we feel the provision in this budget resolution is extremely sound, highly responsible, and should be retained.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have a magnificent contrast in approaches to the budget here this year, as we often have in the past. 
   The budget resolution that the Senator from New Mexico has presented to us is, in fact, a true balanced budget. The budget resolution presented to us by the President of the United States, in fact, spends more than 20 percent of the Social Security surpluses over the next 5 years on programs that are totally unrelated to Social Security. 
   The President has promised that all of the Social Security surpluses will go into the Social Security system. In fact, his budget does not keep that promise. The proposal before us from the Budget Committee and from the Senator from New Mexico does keep that promise and calls for the creation of a lockbox that prevents the spending of Social Security money for other purposes and for other programs. 
   Secondly, we do face a crisis in Medicare. The Medicare Part A hospital insurance trust fund will, in fact, go bankrupt in the year 2008, postponed by actions taken by the Congress 
   just a year ago. 
   We have had as our creation a bipartisan Medicare Commission work on long-term solutions for Medicare over the course of the last year. A majority of the members of that Commission, but not a sufficient number, have voted for true reform in Medicare. That true reform has been blocked by the President who instead proposes simply a paper transfer, which will literally paper over the serious problems that Medicare faces until they are far more serious than they are today and provide a burden for our children and grandchildren that in all probability cannot be met. 
   The current issue of Newsweek puts this dilemma in graphic terms, stating:  
   Can the faltering Medicare system be saved? Probably not this year. The reason is politics. Democrats privately admit they do not want a Medicare deal because it would deprive them of a powerful campaign issue. What many Democrats want is a good issue, not good policy, and good policy is what is needed.  
   Good policy will be available. The politics are reflected in the amendment on which we will vote shortly from the Senator from Illinois that simply papers over the problem itself. 
   Third, tax relief. This budget resolution, sponsored by the senior Senator from New Mexico, calls for real tax relief for the American people to be taken out of the non-Social Security surplus over the course of the next decade. It gives that offer because it presumes the logical conclusion that if we have a surplus over and above a Social Security surplus, it means that the people of the United States have been overtaxed and that that money should stay in their pockets to be used in the way in which they wish. 
   The President's proposal, which actually increases taxes over the next decade by almost $100 billion, feels that the worst thing we can possibly do is allow Americans to spend more of their own money. Amendment after amendment, which we will be facing today and tomorrow and Friday, attempt not only to prevent tax relief from taking place this year, but prevent tax relief from taking place for 10 years, for 12 years and, in the case of one amendment we expect, for 75 years. The worst thing that could possibly happen, according to many on the other side, would be to provide tax relief for the American people out of a genuine non-Social Security surplus. 
   How do they do that? Partly by amendments such as the Durbin amendment, but primarily through the 70 or more new spending programs that the President has included in his budget, new spending programs that will spend money not only from the non-Social Security surplus but to the tune of more than $100 billion out of the Social Security surplus itself. 
   Mr. President, that is the improper way in which to go. We should deal with the Medicare crisis in a straightforward Medicare reform--a difficult debate but a solution that is actually possible, as indicated by one of the leading Members of the Democratic Party in this body, Senator BREAUX, in his chairmanship of that Medicare Reform Commission--through real Social Security reform. We must put the entire Social Security surplus aside in a lockbox so that it cannot be spent on all of the new and increased programs advocated by the President's budget. As a consequence, the Abraham amendment is a vitally important amendment and a key to the debate on this budget resolution. 
   To summarize, the budget resolution before us proposed by the Budget Committee, under the leadership of my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, the chairman, truly protects Social Security, truly balances the budget of the United States, and pays down the debt, truly anticipates Medicare reform that is substantive and not inform only, truly limits spending on other programs and truly returns the surpluses that are appropriately returned to the people of the United  States to the taxpayers who now are overtaxed in a good economy to pay for them. 
   Mr. President, the Abraham amendment should be supported, the Durbin amendment should be rejected, and we should go forth and adopt this budget resolution, generally speaking, in the form in which it finds itself at the present time. It is only the first step. Many difficult steps remain. But if we do so, if, in fact, we limit our insatiable appetite for spending, I believe we can promise the American people a strong and growing economy for a considerable period of time in the future.

Mr. President, the Senate is about to be presented with a resolution authorizing the President of the United States to intervene in a civil war in the Republic of Yugoslavia--one of many civil wars taking place around the world, in which one dominant group is repressing, killing, and displacing a minority group within their borders. 
   Mr. President, the cause of this civil war is Mr. Milosevic, the dictator of Serbia and of the Yugoslav Republic. But nowhere in any of the administration's stated goals justifying this intervention is included the removal of Mr. Milosevic from his position of power. The goal is neither a stated nor an unstated goal. Therefore, we are about to engage in a civil war in which we do not go after the cause of the war. 
   Just a few years ago, the last occasion on which we debated authorizing the President of the United States to engage the Armed Forces of our country far from the borders of the United States, in Iraq, after its invasion of Kuwait, we made the determination, and after successfully removing the symptom, the invasion and occupation of Kuwait, that we would not remove the cause--Saddam Hussein. As a consequence of not going after the cause, we have been involved in either a cold or a hot war with Iraq ever since, at great cost in money to the United States, and at a considerable cost to our support for that cause around the world.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, technology is the driving force behind the U.S. economy, and investment in research and development is the driving force behind technology. Without research and development, the Internet would not exist. Without research and development, bone marrow transplants would not be saving lives. Without research and development, global satellite networks would not bring instantaneous news from around the world into our living rooms. 
   Quite simply, Mr. President, research and development encourages economic growth, creates jobs, and gives U.S. businesses an edge in today's competitive world marketplace. 
   That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation introduced today by my colleagues Senator HATCH and Senator BAUCUS. This bill to make permanent the R&D tax credit will enable private businesses large and small to spend more of their resources on research and development. I have long been a strong supporter of the R&D tax credit and am delighted to join the effort to make it permanent. 
   As my colleagues know, the credit was first created in 1981 as a way to encourage the development of new and innovative commercial technologies and has been renewed nine times. Unfortunately, Congress has never made the tax credit permanent. Such a year to year uncertainty prohibits companies from making long-term R&D plans that take the tax credit into account. This lack of permanency leads inevitably to a lower rate of investment in research and development. That, Mr. President, slows U.S. innovation and economic growth, results in fewer jobs for Americans, and places U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies. 
   Making the R&D tax credit permanent is one of the easiest and most effective measures we can take to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the high tech industry. 
   The credit spurs economic growth. A recent study by Coopers & Lybrand found that every dollar of tax benefit generates as much as one dollar of additional private R and D spending in the short term and as much as two dollars of long-term R and D investment. The study concluded that over the 1998-2010 period, U.S. companies would spend 41 billion dollars more on research and development if the credit were made permanent. Further, innovations from that additional R and D investment would add more than 13 billion dollars a year to the economy's productive capacity by the year 2010. 
   The credit creates jobs. Because it is targeted primarily at salaries and wages of employees directly involved in research and experimentation, it is an incentive for companies to create and sustain high-skilled, high-paying jobs. 
   The credit helps U.S. companies compete. The R and D Tax Credit Coalition, a group of over 1000 American companies and 52 trade associations dedicated to making the tax credit permanent, argues that the credit is an essential tool for U.S. companies competing against foreign firms. Foreign companies often benefit from research and development subsidies from their governments. Such incentives lower the cost of R and D in foreign countries and give companies receiving the subsidies a competitive advantage over U.S. firms. According to the Coalition, U.S. corporate research and development spending lags far behind Germany and Japan as a percentage of sales. Making the tax credit permanent will go a long way to eliminate this disadvantage. 
   In my home state of Washington, hundreds of businesses, both large and small, use the R&D tax credit to develop new and innovative products and create jobs. In fact, Washington is making a name for itself as the home of a large and growing high technology industry. Last year, the American Electronics Association named Washington a ``cyber state'' and found that 45 out of every 1,000 private sector  workers in the state are employed by high-tech firms. According to AEA, Washington leads the nation in high-tech wages with an average high-tech salary in the state of over 66 thousand dollars a year. 
   Not surprisingly then, we in Washington view the R&D credit as a valued complement to our state's economic development policies. In fact, the Coopers and Lybrand study estimates that the credit will increase Washington's Gross State Product by $1.4 billion and the state's payroll by $1.6 billion over the next decade. 
   The Hatch-Baucus legislation to make the R&D tax credit permanent will benefit Washington and every other state in the nation. It is a smart and effective piece of legislation. It spurs economic growth, creates jobs, and helps U.S. companies compete more effectively. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting innovation in America.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for a short while today and on Monday and on Tuesday, we will debating a very short, clear, and concise proposal by the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire, Senator SMITH, relating to the use of American Armed Forces in combat in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. 
   Mr. President, I want to state as forcefully as I possibly can my support for that amendment. Senator SMITH states, I think with total accuracy, that the U.S. national security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that warrants military operations by the United States. It goes on to point out that any intervention on our part would be to engage the Armed Forces of the United States in a civil war inside the truncated but still nation of Yugoslavia. 
   Mr. President, there was an op-ed column in the Washington Post just 3 days ago in which the author set out three principles that struck me as totally sound and logical. Rule 1 is, don't involve yourself in a civil war; rule 2, if you do involve yourself in a civil war, take a side; rule 3, if you do involve yourself in a civil war and take a side, make certain that your side wins. 
   Mr. President, the proposed intervention in Kosovo on the part of the United States essentially violates all three of those rules. Clearly, it will involve us in a civil war. To a large extent, we will not have picked a side because we will not be promoting what those who are revolting against the Serbian authorities wish; that is to say, their independence. And we clearly aren't going in with the intention of winning in the sense of settling that conflict. 
   So we will follow the sorry example of this administration's military adventures so far: The billions of dollars we have spent in Haiti with troops still in that country now simply defending themselves, without having any discernible positive impact on that society; the low caliber war in which we have been engaged on and off in Iraq without any discernible prospect of removing Saddam Hussein from office; and our multibillion-dollar adventure in Bosnia, an adventure that has no end, because we are attempting to force people to live together who have no intention and no willingness to do so; and, now here in Kosovo we propose to do exactly the same thing. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the situation would be different and perhaps more justifiable if the President were to go all the way and to say that the service of freedom requires liberating people who no longer wish to be a part of Yugoslavia and helping them attain their freedom. But we are not doing that. We continue to promote the fiction that borders will not be changed.  
   The Secretary of State has justified this intervention on three grounds: that it is vital to the survival of NATO, a strange proposition when we have gotten NATO into this position largely ourselves and largely by accident; second, that there are humanitarian reasons to save the victims of this civil war, a justification which will also require us to enter a civil war in Africa, and perhaps in Afghanistan, and in Lord knows how many other places around the world; and the ancient domino theory that if we don't stop this fighting here, it will next go 
   over into Macedonia, into Greece, and into Turkey. But if we were to defend Macedonia, at least we would be defending a sovereign nation. 
   Mr. President, I am convinced that before the President commits our Armed Forces to combat in Kosovo that he should be required to seek the advice and consent of both of the Houses of the Congress of the United States. I am convinced that this is a matter on which the views of this body should be known formally after a debate, and by a vote. I am convinced that the amendment sets the issues in this case in stark and appropriate context. And I am convinced, Mr. President, that we should vote in favor of that Smith amendment; that we should not risk the lives of members of our armed services and the prestige of the United States to an undefined cause for undefined and secondary ends in a way in which those ends are highly unlikely to be met, or at least highly unlikely to be met without a permanent investment in both our money and in our Armed Forces.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will reconvene on Monday at 12 noon and begin a period of morning business until 4 p.m. The first 2 hours of morning business time have been reserved for general statements, with the second 2 hours reserved for the two leaders, with the understanding that statements during that time will be in relation to Kosovo. 
   Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. The leader has announced there will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session; however, it is hoped that Members who still have amendments to the supplemental bill will come to the floor on Monday to offer and debate those amendments. Any votes ordered with respect to the supplemental bill will be postponed to occur on Tuesday, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. 
   A cloture motion was filed today on the Lott second-degree amendment relating to Kosovo. That vote will occur on Tuesday at 2:15 p.m. The cooperation of all Senators will be necessary next week in order to finish the supplemental bill and the budget resolution prior to the Easter recess.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, one of the ways in which the Congress of the United States has been the bane of every Governor and State legislator in the United States of America is its constant willingness to impose unfunded mandates on States and on local communities. We constantly pass laws that tell States and local communities what they are to do, but we rarely pass appropriations sufficient to cover the costs of carrying out those duties. 
   Just last week we debated the overwhelming unfunded mandate that is included in our rules relating to the education of special needs students, and, in fact, we moved, at least slightly, in the direction of funding some portion of those unfunded mandates. Here, on the other hand, we have the exact mirror image of an unfunded mandate originally imposed by the Congress of the United States. Here we are asked, in this amendment, to decide that billions of dollars recovered by almost every State in the Union in tobacco litigation against tobacco companies will be appropriated, effectively, by the Federal Government, unless the States agree on the way in which we think that money ought to be spent. 
   Mr. President, 50 percent of all recoveries that the States have made, pursuant to this amendment, must be spent in accordance with this amendment, and detailed regulations are promulgated by the Federal Government for every State in the country. Every Governor will have to make a new application every year for 25 years and meet these requirements or will, in effect, lose an amount of money equal to 50 percent to 100 percent of the money that State has already recovered in an action in which the United States of America was not a party at all. 
   That is fundamentally unfair. It makes an assumption, an unwarranted assumption, that these were Medicaid claims that were presented by the States of the United States. My attorney general, the attorney general of the State of Washington, Christine Gregoire, one of the three or four leaders of this effort, brought and prosecuted a case through much of the trial period, before it was ultimately settled, without the slightest mention of Medicaid. There were all kinds of fraud and contract and tort claims connected with this litigation, quite independent of Medicaid claims on the part of the various States of the United States of America. Last year, this body spent weeks debating whether or not we should control the settlements that the States were making. We ultimately abandoned that effort and left it entirely to the States. 
   As a consequence, we have absolutely no right, at this 
   point, to tell the States how they are to spend their money. Many are already engaged in extensive and sometimes successful antismoking efforts. Many have priorities that are different than the priorities here in the U.S. Senate. But if Members of the U.S. Senate want to control the spending in their own States, money that their own States have recovered, they should run for the State legislature, not for the Senate of the United States. 
   The position taken by the Senator from Texas and her companion, the Senator from Florida, a position that was accepted by the Senate Appropriations Committee, is the right and just position. This money was recovered by the States, this money belongs to the States, and the spending of this money should be determined by each of the 50 States of the United States of America. 
   It is no more difficult than that. It is as simple as that. We have already imposed too many unfunded mandates on the States by our substantive legislation here. Let's not do essentially the same thing by telling States that money they have already recovered has to be spent on our priorities, rather than their own. Support the position of the Senator from Texas and Florida. Reject this amendment.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on Monday, my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, came to the floor to respond to a statement that I gave a week or so earlier on the Justice Department's misguided antitrust case against Microsoft. 
   Mr. President, this has become something of a habit for the Senator from Utah and myself. We have debated that lawsuit since well before it was commenced, more than a year ago. 
   I am happy to state that I want to start these brief remarks with two points on which I find myself in complete agreement with Senator HATCH. First, during a speech on Monday, he joined with me in asking that the Vice President of the United States, Mr. GORE, state his position on whether or not this form of antitrust action is appropriate. I centered my own speech on the frequent visits the Vice President has made to the State of Washington and his refusal to take any such position. The Senator from Utah said:  
   Government should not exert unwarranted control over the Internet, even if Vice President Gore thinks that he created it.  
   I am delighted that the Senator from Utah has joined me in that sentiment. Now there are at least two of us who believe that the Vice President of the United States should make his views known on the subject. 
   Secondly, the Senator from Utah, in dealing with the request by the Department of Justice that it receive a substantial additional appropriation for fiscal year 2000 for antitrust enforcement, stated that he is concerned about the value thresholds in what is called the Hart-Scott-Rodino legislation relating to mergers and feels that the minimum size of those mergers should be moved upward to reflect inflation in the couple of decades since that bill was passed, therefore, questions at least some portion of the request for additional appropriations on the part of the Antitrust Division. 
   As I have said before, I believe that it deserves no increase at all, that the philosophy that it is following harasses the business community unduly, and inhibits the continuation of the economic success stories all across our American economy but particularly in computer software. 
   Having said that, the Senator from Utah and I continue to disagree, though I wish to emphasize that my primary disagreement is with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice of the United States and this particular lawsuit. 
   The disagreement really fundamentally comes down to one point: Antitrust law enforcement should be followed for the benefit of consumers. The Government of the United States has no business financing what is essentially a private antitrust case. If there are competitors of Microsoft who think they have been unsuccessful and wish to finance their own antitrust lawsuits, they are entitled to do so. The taxpayers of the United States, on the other hand, should not be required to pay their money for what is a private dispute, primarily between Netscape and Microsoft. 
   That remains essentially the gravamen of the antitrust action that the Justice Department in 19 States is prosecuting at the present time. 
   There is only the slightest lip service given in the course of that lawsuit or by the senior Senator from Utah to consumer benefit. This is not surprising, Mr. President, because there is no discernible consumer benefit in the demands of this lawsuit. 
   Consumers have been benefited by the highly competitive nature of the software market. They are benefited by having the kind of platform that Microsoft provides for thousands of different applications and uses on the part of hundreds of different companies all through the United States. 
   This is not a consumer protection lawsuit. I may say, not entirely in passing, that I know a consumer protection lawsuit when I see one. I was attorney general of the State of Washington for 12 years. I prosecuted a wide range of antitrust and consumer protection lawsuits. But every one of those antitrust cases was based on the proposition that consumers were being disadvantaged by some form of price fixing or other violation of the law. I did not regard it as my business to represent essentially one business unhappy and harmed by competition for a more effective competitor. 
   The basis of my objection to this lawsuit is that it is not designed for consumer protection. It is designed to benefit competitors. Some of the proposals that have appeared in the newspapers for remedies in case of success, including taking away the intellectual properties of the Microsoft Corporation, perhaps even breaking it up, requiring advance permission on the part of lawyers in the Justice Department for improvements in Windows or in any other product of the Microsoft Corporation, are clearly 
   anticonsumer in nature. 
   The lawsuit is no better now than the day on which it was brought. It is not designed to benefit consumers. It ought to be dropped. 
   I am delighted that at least on two peripheral areas of sometime controversy, the Senator from Utah and I now find ourselves in agreement. Regrettably, we still find ourselves disagreeing on the fundamental basis of the lawsuit. I am sorry he is on the apparent side of the Vice President of the United States and the clear side of the Department of Justice of the United States. 
   I expect this debate to continue, but I expect it to continue to be on the same basis. Do we have a software system, a computer system in the United States which is the wonder of the world that has caused more profound and more progressive changes in our society than that caused in a comparable period of time by any other industry, or somehow or another do we have an industry that needs Government regulation? I think that question answers itself, Mr. President, and I intend to continue to speak out on the subject.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a truly outstanding feat by a 3rd grade class in Fort Lewis, Washington. Mr. Chris Luther's 3rd grade class at Beachwood Elementary School has not missed a spelling word on their weekly spelling tests for 25 weeks. Nearly a month ago, as my colleagues may remember, I announced an ``Innovation in Education Award'' program to recognize the important role individuals and communities play in the education of America's students. This class and their teacher, Mr. Luther, are perfect examples of this principle in action. 
   This is a classroom of average kids, all with different backgrounds and abilities. Yet, Mr. Luther has found a way to encourage and tutor these students so they are all accomplishing equally praiseworthy work. The key has not been some magical formula rather, the success of these students comes from a concerted effort by Mr. Luther to boost their self-esteem, to enhance their memory skills, and to impress upon every child in the classroom that learning is important. Those strategies combined with the individual effort of each of his students has clearly paid off. 
   Mr. Luther's creativity to engage his students in learning extends far beyond spelling. Each year, he produces a ``Math Relay'' that involves some 2000 students from 88 local schools. This remarkable gathering combines physical activity and competition with math questions and answers. Not only does the size of the event speak highly of its success but, the fact that Mr. Luther handles the mind-boggling logistics of an event this size himself is further cause for recognizing this fine educator. 
   I applaud Mr. Luther's initiative, creativity and ability to encourage his students to succeed. It is the work of educators like Mr. Luther and the efforts of students like those in Mr. Luther's 3rd grade class who are making education work across America. That is why it is my pleasure to recognize Mr. Luther and his third grade class for their accomplishments and it is why I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting local educators.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, over the past few years, Vice President AL GORE has made a series of trips to my home State of Washington. His goals on these trips are simple: to raise money for his political campaigns; to recruit supporters for his Presidential endeavors; and to distract Washington State voters from the administration's true agenda for the Pacific Northwest. 
   The Vice President's visits to Washington State are nothing new, but recently the administration, of which he is a vital leader, has chosen to adopt policies that pose a threat to the continued vitality of our economy. Those policies are aimed at the destruction of two of Washington State's economic crown jewels: our hydropower system and Microsoft. 
   During the past year, I have welcomed the Vice President to Washington State by repeatedly asking him two questions: The first, Will you commit to the preservation of each of the dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers unless Congress or the people of the Northwest agree to the removal of each or all of them? The second question: Mr. Vice President, if you are elected President, will you end the Justice Department's suit against Microsoft? 
   At first, these questions were answered with silence. Now the Vice President answers them with personal attacks. Whether it is silence or personal attacks, the Vice President makes clear that he does not intend to answer these two questions so fundamental to every family and community in the Northwest. These questions deserve and should receive straight answers from the Vice President, and I will continue to ask them until the Vice President does so. 
   His silence, of course, is eloquent. Vice President GORE's administration is responsible for the Microsoft lawsuit and for a flatout refusal to subject dam removal either to congressional authority or to the consent of the people of the Northwest. What is most illuminating is that the Vice President's silence and personal attacks in response to these questions about dams and Microsoft run counter to positions taken by top Democratic officeholders in Washington State. When it comes to protecting dams on the Columbia River, our Democratic Governor and Democratic U.S. Senator, two of the most powerful Democrats in Washington State, have already publicly opposed efforts by national environmental organizations to take out dams. But the Vice President is silent. 
   Last week I suggested that he had a political motive. That is my opinion, but, frankly, it doesn't matter why he pursues policies to dismantle our hydro system without being willing to say so openly. What matters is whether he will make his position clear. So who loses out on the equation? The people of Washington State, of course. And then there is Microsoft. 
   The good news is that most Democrats in Washington State have come forward to defend Microsoft's freedom to innovate, but the Vice President won't stand with his fellow Democrats in Washington State in support of the company. When he answers this one, he is either silent or he attacks and then attempts to evade the question. 
   Here is a recent example of the Vice President's verbal dance when it comes to the issue of protecting Microsoft: Last week, I admonished the administration for its assault on that company. In responding to my statement, the Vice President's spokeswoman said that I am ``suffering from a Y2K 
   bug'' and have forgotten all the wonderful things AL GORE has done for Washington State. Specifically, the spokeswoman cited hundreds of thousands of new jobs, higher home ownership rates and lower welfare rolls, as if he were responsible for them. 
   There was no answer to the central question--will you work to end the suit against Microsoft? 
   There was another troubling side to this statement. The Vice President, of course, was attempting to take credit for the booming economy in the State that I represent. He should understand that that success comes from the hundreds of thousands of hard-working Washingtonians, plus Microsoft and the amazing group of entrepreneurs who have developed new and better systems, plus our natural resources, not the least of which is our low-cost electricity, or all of the smaller high-tech companies that have sprung up overnight. This success does not come from the Vice President. 
   As to the specifics of the Justice Department's case against Microsoft, the so-called high-tech Vice President says he will not comment on or involve himself in the Justice Department's case against the company. Can we believe that as the administration's point man on high-tech issues, he has no opinion whatsoever on the highest profile high-tech issue before his administration--the future of Microsoft? I do not believe it, nor does anyone else. 
   To claim that he is not involved in an action spearheaded by his own administration is unbelievable. When the Vice President continually refuses to answer the question of whether or not he supports this attack, he has not been straight with the people of the State of Washington. 
   There is a simple answer to the Microsoft question. The answer is for the Vice President to tell us that if he is elected President, he will stop the Justice Department's pursuit of Microsoft. We Washingtonians are 3,000 miles away from the center of AL GORE's universe, but we know only too well that the actions of this administration can have a long and detrimental impact on our economy, our way of life and on our future. We deserve more from the Vice President than silence, distraction and personal attacks. 
   We will remember his silence on what are perhaps the most important Federal public policy questions to face our State in years. We will remember his evasive comments. We will remember  his refusal to denounce or even comment on the antitrust case against Microsoft and his unwillingness to make clear his position on protecting Columbia and Snake River dams. I challenge the Vice President again today to tell us plainly whether he supports this administration's assault on two of Washington State's economic crown jewels. 
   Do you, Mr. Vice President, support the Justice Department's antitrust action against Microsoft or not? And do you, Mr. Vice President, support the efforts by national environmental groups to destroy dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers or not? 
   We in the Northwest await the Vice President's answers, and you can be sure that so long as silence and evasiveness carry the day, I will continue to ask these questions.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the outstanding achievements of a local educator, Phyllis Marckworth, from Port Townsend in Washington State. Phyllis has been brought to my attention for her devoted efforts in singlehandedly taking charge of efforts to create an integrated system of technology throughout the Port Townsend School District. Indeed, Superintendent Gene Medina credits Phyllis' enthusiastic efforts for literally transforming the fundamental nature of student learning in the district. It is individuals like Ms. Marckworth that should remind all of us here in the U.S. Senate of the indispensable role that the innovation of local educators play in our children's education. 
   Phyllis is the kind of rare and special educator which schools across this country cherish. She serves as a teacher, a technology administrator, and a staff developer. Thus, her contributions to the better education of students of Port Townsend are noteworthy for several reasons: first, her incredible zeal in tirelessly laboring on behalf of the students she serves. In 1993, she was coordinating plans to purchase computers and telephones for the Port Townsend District. Rather than follow the tradition path of initial hardware investment to supply individual classrooms, Phyllis embarked on a bolder and eventually more rewarding task of assembling an entire telecommunications network for all the students in the district to utilize and learn from. That network has since become the backbone of the improved communication and learning in Port Townsend that all schools hope technology will bring to our classrooms. 
   Secondly, her visionary innovation in implementing an integrated system of technology within the Port Townsend school district has resulted not just in a ``technology curriculum'' but technology that is fully integrated within the entire district's curriculum. This integration has resulted in better education for students who now understand and utilize technology as a part of every aspect of their lives and learning, not just a computer that is used for typing term papers or biology lab reports. 
   Finally, this integration which Phyllis sparked has also corresponded with a direct focus on developing the ability of staff throughout the Port Townsend district to make technology a part of their classrooms. Hence, teachers can make technology a part of the whole education process rather than simply a small piece student learning. Too often technology is brought in to the classrooms of today without the training necessary for our teachers to best use that technology to train our students for tomorrow. Phyllis Marckworth has met that challenge head on and has made her district and its students better because of the creative and dedicated way in which she has done so. 
   It is individuals like Phyllis Marchworth that make education across this country and in our local schools great, not more rules and regulations from Washington, DC. As we in the Senate work on important education legislation, I hope my colleagues will remember the innovative work of educators like Phyllis Marchworth who show how local communities create education success stories when we give them the flexibility they need and deserve.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe it appropriate to step back one or two steps from the debate over educational flexibility legislation and the 100,000 teachers proposal which is in front of us and look at the general philosophy of Federal education and the profound differences between the two sides. 
   Perhaps the best place in which to determine the attitude of the Clinton administration and its supporters here in Congress with respect to the Federal role in education is the budget of the United States submitted by the President approximately 1 month ago. 
   For a number of years, there has been one relatively modest program of unrestricted aid to school districts across the United States of America. It is called title VI, for innovative program strategies, the least rule-infested, the least bureaucracy-influenced of all of the forms of Federal aid to education. For the present year, 1999, it amounts to $375 million, a very modest amount of Federal aid to education. 
   In the budget of the President of the United States for the year 2000, it has zero dollars. It is simply wiped out. In its place are nine new specific Federal programs, many of which have been discussed by Democratic Members of this Senate, totaling almost $250 million, every one of which is aimed at a precise goal, every one of which says we in Washington, DC, know which school districts across the United States know better than do the parents, teachers, and school board members in those individual communities, and we are going to give you money with strings and rules attached. 
   Now, there is another Federal program which gives money to certain school districts that they can use for any educational purpose. It is called impact aid, and it goes to school districts which encompass Federal military reservations or other large Federal presences or in which there are many students who come from such grounds where property taxes are not collected as the basic support for public schools. The money that comes to those school districts can be spent in the way those school districts deem most effective for the education of their kids. 
   Impact aid in this budget from the President is cut by $128 million--just slightly less than the $200 million earmarked almost solely for new teachers that is the subject of the debate right here right now. In other words, let's stop allowing these school districts to determine their own educational priorities and we will tell them what their priorities are here. 
   Interestingly enough, the total of each of these disfavored programs is almost identical to the amount of money in the new, more categorical aid programs that the President has come up with. 
   Dwarfing that, Mr. President, is the lack of support for special education for IDEA. The President disguises that lack of support by roughly the same number of dollars nominally for the year 2000 as he has for the year 1999. But almost $2 billion of that is the funding that will not go to the schools until October 1 of the year 2000. In other words, it won't be charged against any deficit in the general fund in the year 2000 itself, it will be forwarded to the year 2001. It will be a bill for the people of the United States to pay, a hidden bill. 
   Now, that is balanced off by several billion worth of school construction bonds, the full cost of which to the Federal Government is only $150 million in the year 2000 but will be billions by the time we are all finished. 
   Finally, there are a number of present programs--all categorical programs--in the budget which are increased about $750 million, but the pattern is overwhelming. This administration will cut or eliminate those programs in which the school districts have plenary authority to make choices in which teachers, parents, principals, and school board members set educational priorities. In every case--including the teachers amendments we are talking about here--the judgment by this administration and by those who support it is a very simple one: Local school boards, even State authorities, don't know how to spend their education money and we have to tell them how to do it. 
   So this particular debate over one or two of these particular new programs--always aimed at valid goals, of course --really is a disguise for the statement that more and more control should be transferred from local school boards, from local entities, and even from the States, to the Department of Education and Washington, DC, and to all of the great educational experts here in the U.S. Senate who know how to run all 17,000 school districts in the United States as a whole. 
   The Senator from Vermont has a perfect alternative, it seems to me, to this proposition. That is, at the very least, let school districts determine whether they want to spend the money on this narrow teachers program or whether they want to cover the obligations we have already undertaken in the Disability Education Program, the special needs students, 
   where just 2 years ago we passed, and the President signed, a bill stating that we would support 40 percent of the cost of that special education. We are at about 9 percent right  now. And when you take out the phony $1.9 billion, which won't even be charged against the 2000 budget, it will drop to about 6 percent. Why? In order to come up with all of these fine-sounding new programs in which the Federal Government tells each school district exactly how it should operate. 
   The choice, Mr. President, is a dramatic choice. The choice is whether or not we will follow the course of this administration and reduce substantially the amount of money we allow school districts to determine the goals for themselves, or tell them more and more what they should do for themselves. 
   Mr. President, that simply is not the right direction in which to go, and the increasing categorization of schools should be reversed. We should at least give the flexibility the Senator from Vermont has asked for in the spending of new money--money above and beyond the amount of money that we are devoting to education at the present time. I commend his arguments to my colleagues and hope we will act accordingly.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator GRAMS, introduced S. Con. Res. 16 last week. I am a cosponsor of that legislation expressing the Sense that the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) guaranty fee should not be increased. 
   Ginnie Mae was established to help provide affordable homeownership opportunities for all Americans by facilitating the sale of securities backed by mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veteran's Affairs, and the Rural Housing Service. The Ginnie Mae guaranty assures investors in the securities that they will receive all payments due in a timely manner. Ginnie Mae assesses a fee on lenders who issue such securities and notes for this guaranty. Currently, lenders are charged six basis points per loan. 
   The Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities program has been a universal success. Almost 19 million homes have been financed through Ginnie Mae securities. Ginnie Mae creates a way for Americans who are unable to find other financing options to partake in the dream of homeownership. More than 95 percent of all FHA and VA mortgages are securitized through Ginnie Mae. It is no secret that first-time homebuyers comprise more than two-thirds of FHA home purchase loans and that about 34 percent of FHA borrowers are minorities. In its most basic form, Ginnie Mae creates homeownership opportunities for those borrowers who are typically unserved or underserved by the conventional mortgage markets. 
   During the last Congress, there were several attempts to increase the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee. Fortunately, most of these attempts failed. However, an increase of three basis points was adopted during deliberations on the Higher Education Reauthorization Act effective in 2004. All of the attempts sought to use the revenue gained by the increase to pay for spending elsewhere. This pattern must be stopped. Not only should Congress refuse to raise the guaranty fee under any circumstances, but it should also seek to have this arbitrary increase repealed prior to effect. 
   I believe that any increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee is an unnecessary tax on homeownership that would cost homebuyers hundreds of dollars in additional expense at closing and prevent thousands of families from achieving the dream of homeownership. It would defeat the very mission of Ginnie Mae. 
   In addition, an increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee has absolutely no financial basis. Recently, the independent auditor, KPMG, confirmed that Ginnie Mae is financially sound. In fact, Ginnie Mae had a record profit of  $601 million in 1997. In that year alone, Ginnie Mae collected a total of $326 million in guaranty fees. It paid out only $11 million in unreimbursed claims. It is apparent that Ginnie Mae does not need the financial boost from the increase fee. 
   Even in this era of low interest rates, the dream of homeownership is elusive for many American families. Extensive efforts should be made to eliminate the barriers to affordable housing. Any increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee creates a substantial impediment to homeownership. Such a result is unacceptable. 
   I ask Senators to please join me in opposing this unjustified tax on homeownership.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Bernice Shivley in my home state of Washington for her efforts to promote literacy in her community. As I have traveled around Washington state, I hear again and again about the great strides ``First Book'' has made in improving children's literacy and in particular, I hear remarkable praise for Bernice Shivley, the First Book Coordinator in Pend Oreille County. 
   First Book is a national non-profit organization with a single mission: To give disadvantaged children the opportunity to read and own their first new book. At the national level, First Book has developed a sustained network of strategic partnerships with groups and companies like the American Library Association and Barnes & Noble, Inc. The key to First Book's success, however, is the inspiration and commitment of local communities. 
   In each locality, First Book establishes an advisory board comprised of volunteer leaders including librarians, teachers, retailers, and public officials. These boards work with existing local literacy programs to increase the availability of tutors, book grants, and to promote special events--all in the name of improved literacy. Most importantly, perhaps, First Book reaches out to the children who are most difficult to reach: the children in soap kitchens and in homeless shelters, in church basements and in youth centers. 
   In Pend Oreille County, which is in the northeast corner of Washington state, Bernice Shivley has made the success of First Book her passion. The regional coordinator for First Book tells me that ``Bernice is a model for what First Book is all about.'' She has graciously volunteered her time and has spent countless hours creating an advisory board, securing donations from area business, and identifying local literacy programs to support. For these reasons, I am awarding Bernice the second of my weekly ``Innovation in Education Awards.'' 
   It is the actions of people like Bernice around the country that should remind us here in Washington, DC that those closest to our children are best equipped to make important decisions regarding their education. I commend Bernice for her outstanding work on behalf of the children and citizens of Pend Oreille County.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week the Government's misguided and collusive antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation recessed for a much-needed break. It only could be improved by making the recess permanent. 
   I urge my colleagues to make use of the trial's recess to learn about this case, and this industry. Nothing less is at stake here than the freedom to innovate, the key to America's economic success. We ignore this prosecution at our peril, because the United States Government is trying to kill the goose that lays golden eggs in the home states of every one of my esteemed colleagues. It is not simply a Washington-state company that needs shoring up; it is the industry leader that has fueled our recent unprecedented economic miracle, created hundreds of thousands of new jobs to fill those being lost in other sectors of the economy, established America as the global leader in high technology and redefined almost every aspect of our lives--and yet is under siege by a hopelessly time-locked Department of Justice, whose theory of antitrust was shaped in the 60s, when big business was bad, big government good, and facts never got in the way of a nice regulatory scheme. 
   Microsoft is not the only target of this Administration. Intel too is under attack by a gaggle of anti-free market attorneys at the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC says Intel uses its market power to stifle competition in the lucrative chip market. Given recent reports that in January, more computers were sold with chips made by one of Intel's largest competitors, AMD, than with Intel chips, the FTC's case seems far behind the times. But Robert Pitofsky and his cohorts press on regardless of real and dynamic markets. 
   Holman Jenkins summed up the absurdity of the Administration's actions eloquently in an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal yesterday:  
   If Joel Klein, Robert Pitofsky and all their little acolytes could catch just one mugger, they would have done something of more value for the country. For that matter, we'd owe the mugger a debt of gratitude for distracting these errant knights from their destructive mission.  
   Of course, I know the pressures of time and schedules on my colleagues, so, of all the millions of words that have been written about the Microsoft trial since its beginning last October, I want them to note just one story, written February 18 on C-Net news.com about Microsoft's recent roller coaster ride on Wall Street. The lead paragraph won't take much more than 10 seconds of my colleagues' valuable time, but it tells everything anyone needs to know about this case: 
   ``Microsoft shares fell as much as 3.8% today,'' the C-net story began, ``on investor concern about threats to the company's dominance from the Linux operating system and the landmark antitrust trial.'' 
   George Orwell couldn't have put it better: With competitors baying at its heels, Microsoft has been forced to divert enormous resources to defend  itself against the government's contention that it has no competitors. 
   Actually, George Orwell himself would have rejected the travesty of what is basically a private suit brought by the government on behalf of competing multi-billion-dollar companies against their chief competitor--especially when the government is heavily vested politically in those companies' success. 
   Whether Orwell would have believed it or not, my colleagues need to believe it, because it's happening, and their constituents don't like it. A poll taken by Citizens for a Sound Economy 
   in January found that 81% of Americans--not just Washingtonians, but 81% of all Americans--say that Microsoft is good for consumers. A Hart/Teeter poll also from January found that 73% of Americans echo that belief and fully two-thirds say the federal government should stay out of the dispute and let the marketplace and consumers decide the fate of competitors in the personal computer industry. A majority know enough about what's already happening in the industry to understand that the whole expensive circus is moot anyway: 51% of Americans think that the federal government should just drop the case in the wake of AOL-Netscape merger. 
   Our constituents are paying attention to this issue because they are consumers and are perfectly aware of how much Microsoft has improved their lives. They also see family, friends and neighbors working for companies that depend on Microsoft for their existence. There are tens of thousands of companies, large and small, that partner with Microsoft, and they are located in every state in the Nation. I'm sure my colleagues know something about them, but I'm not convinced that they are aware of their huge numbers. That's why I asked Microsoft for a state-by-state breakdown of their ``partners,'' companies that work directly with or through Microsoft or its products. Microsoft provided me with the data, which I want to share with my colleagues. 
   Here, I say to the Presiding Officer the Senator from Kansas with 1,171 resale partners and 63 technology partners: Microsoft's partners fall into many categories: software retail stores; small Original Equipment Manufacturers that build and sell PC systems with Microsoft software preinstalled; Corporate Account Resellers who resell Microsoft software to large corporations; providers who sell packaged Microsoft software with value-added consulting services; PC manufacturers; and Microsoft Certified Solution Providers. 
   I direct my colleagues' attention to this map that shows the number of these partners in each of their own states. First, the national numbers: Microsoft has 7,279 technology partners and 112,819 resale partners. 
   These figures represent companies, not employees. Senator MURRAY and I are already well aware of Washington's 2,637 resale partners and 254 technology partners. Our state's economy is absolutely booming--and it's due not only to the presence of Microsoft itself, but to the thousands of other companies that Microsoft supports. Companies like Technology Express of Bothell and Techpower Solutions Incorporated of Redmond. 
   But I wonder if my other colleagues have stopped to consider what Justice's assault on Microsoft might do to their own state's economies and jobs--and how their constituents might feel about that impact. Let's look at Utah as an example. Utah is home to 64 technology partners and 1,153 resale partners of Microsoft--home to real people working in real jobs for real companies. Companies like PC Innovation Incorporated in Salt Lake City and Vitrex Corporation of Ogden. Despite these facts, the senior Senator from Utah, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has chosen to take the side of the Justice Department and to support the Administration's efforts to squelch the freedom of companies in his own state to innovate. 
   My colleagues should talk with consumers about their views of technology, because as my fellow Senators begin to understand how the technology business works, they will discover consumers not only have not been harmed by Microsoft, but have benefited: Innovation is booming, choices are growing, and prices are falling for all software. 
   Microsoft is leading an industry that the old school Department of Justice just doesn't understand. There are none of the traditional barriers to entry in the high tech industry that have historically motivated antitrust enforcement. This market moves at the speed of ideas--and a good idea can cause a company to lose 90 percent of market share overnight--precisely what happened to once-dominant products such as WordStar and Word Perfect; precisely what could happen to Microsoft. 
   This Justice Department, led by Joel Klein, is brazen about its desire to intervene in markets, even when it knows little about the markets it meddles with. ``Surgical intervention'' is the spin that Klein and his department has coined to describe its interventionist approach. 
   To recap the recent history of this misguided lawsuit, the original charge--that Microsoft illegally tied Internet browsing to its operating system--was rejected before the trial even began by a 3-member Court of Appeals ruling that recognized that putting Internet Explorer technologies into Windows '95 was a beneficial integration, not a monopolistic tie-in. The Court even admonished Klein and cohorts not to try tinkering with software design and warned them to be wary of intruding into marketplace innovation and product design. A mere week before the Court of Appeals ruling came out, the Department of Justice filed its current lawsuit against Windows 98--a product even more integrated than Windows 95. 
   For this trial, Klein and company simply changed tactics. Instead of arguing the case on its legal merits, the Justice Department has engaged in an all-out public relations battle. The new PR strategy has been orchestrated under Joel Klein's watch and has been the primary strategy in the courtroom as well. The government's lead lawyer, Mr. Boies has a few aggressive e-mail messages that showed Microsoft to be exactly the fiercely competitive entity that has engendered its impressive market performance, but nothing more sinister. Mr. Boies uses these same pieces of e-mail over and over again in highly theatrical ways to try and embarrass and intimidate Microsoft's witnesses. At breaks in the trial every day, the Government turns the courthouse steps into ground zero for its spin game knowing full well its legal strategy had failed before it ever left the gate. 
   Despite their shaky legal case, the press has recently reported that Justice Department officials and the Attorneys General from 19 states suing Microsoft are already discussing post trial ``remedies.'' Before any decision has been made in the case, Antitrust Division officials are contemplating punishments. Before they have proven any consumer harm, they are devising consumer remedies. Before they have made closing arguments, they have coined a cute catch phrase for their planned breakup of the company. They call the tiny remnants of the future broken Microsoft they already have the hubris to predict ``Baby Bills.'' 
   Whatever happened to letting justice take its course? Are we to assume that the outcome of the trial is a foregone conclusion? Why are we wasting taxpayer money on attorneys fees when all that is really going on is a show trial? 
   On the other hand, Microsoft has put on a very strong record in this case in areas relevant to the law and the claims brought by the government: trying law, foreclosure of product through exclusionary contracts and the fundamental element of consumer harm. 
   The facts so far in the record show Microsoft to be on firm legal ground in all these areas. The Appeals Court verified there was no illegal tying. James Barksdale, Netscape's CEO, admitted that Microsoft did not foreclose his company from the market. And the government's final witness, economist Franklin Fisher, testified that, on balance, Microsoft has not harmed consumers. 
   As Attorney General for Washington State, I argued 14 cases before the United States Supreme Court. My focus as Attorney General was consumer protection. I want to assure my colleagues today that, had this case  been presented to me as an Attorney General, I wouldn't have given it a second glance because there is no evidence whatsoever that Microsoft has harmed consumers. 
   But Joel Klein doesn't care about protecting consumers. He cares about protecting companies that cannot compete on their own. In a recent speech, he stated that it was the job of antitrust to ``reallocate resources between the producer and the consumer.'' 
   Really? To reallocate resources? That's what antitrust is for? 
   Well, I agree with Mr. Klein's assessment on one count: this trial was designed precisely to reallocate resources--from Microsoft to Microsoft's competitors. And why would the Department want to do that? Perhaps because the resources the Administration really wants to reallocate are California's electoral votes into AL GORE's column come the year 2000. Just this past Tuesday the San Francisco Chronicle said that Mr. GORE ``unabashedly acknowledged that he has lavished attention on California, which carries a rich cache of votes--and campaign donors. According to his staff, the Vice President has visited the State 53 times since taking office five years ago.'' In a separate story, the Chronicle quotes the Vice President as saying, ``California is the biggest, most important State. ..... It deserves the most attention, and I'm going to make sure it gets it.'' 
   So, needing California in 2000, lusting for a return to the regulatory excess needed to feed the insatiable maw of big government, and wanting to throw trial lawyers some fresh meat, but lacking anything closely resembling a credible legal case, what have Klein and Co. done? They've demonized the most innovative, extraordinary world-changing engine for progress that this world may ever have seen. As my colleagues think about the implications of our failure to protest this demonization, let's just take a closer look at the ``demon'' itself and see what innovations the forces of government regulatory mediocrity are about to foreclose. 
   Microsoft's economic contributions already are common knowledge, and I've just provided the State-by-State breakdown, but here's a refresher: In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, Microsoft's net revenues were $14.48 billion--56 percent of which came from international trade. In my home State of Washington, by the end of 1998 Microsoft employed almost 16,000 workers. Nationwide the figure was almost 20,000--and that's without factoring in the number of jobs represented by the 120,000 plus companies on the Partners' map I've just shown my colleagues. Microsoft generates jobs worldwide as well, with subsidiaries in nearly 60 countries, from Austria to Vietnam, Costa Rica to the Czech and Slovak Republics, Saudi Arabia to South Africa. 
   National productivity and workplace efficiency? The value provided is very nearly beyond our ability to calculate. Ironically, Windows, the product portrayed by Klein and cohorts as anti-consumer, was purposely designed by Microsoft to support and encourage the greatest number of innovations possible by independent software programmers, who need a uniform, broad-based platform on which to write code that will be economically viable in smaller niche markets. The result has been an enormous proliferation of software designed to fill every imaginable consumer need. 
   How about other, less obvious innovations this company is responsible for? Let's start with products that just make life better for ordinary people, like WebTV, which lets people use their television sets to connect to the Internet. That's innovation for 
   the better. And there's also Windows' accessibility features--magnifiers, high-contrast schemes, special keys and sound enhancements among many--that make computers easy to use for many people with disabilities--opening doors that previously were locked tight. Education? Microsoft donates millions of dollars in cash and software to schools and libraries every year. 
   Microsoft was recently voted the 3rd most admired company in Fortune's annual poll. That's some demon the Justice Department has targeted. It had better hurry and shut Microsoft down completely or the next thing you know Microsoft will help lower the cost of computing even more or spawn even greater technological and cultural innovations that will make our lives easier and better, and then where would we be? 
   Mr. President, irony aside, there is no aspect of this case that does not offend me. 
   As a lawyer, I have nothing but contempt for the flaccid PR case hoisted feebly in Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's court by the govenment's inquisitors. 
   As a former Attorney General who left a solid legacy of consumer protection, I am appalled at the Orwellian double-speak government lawyers spew forth as they pretend to act on behalf of consumers while simultaneously seeking to dictate what they may consume. 
   As a free-market advocate of decades-long standing, I am chagrined at the ``Damn-the-consequences-full-speed-backward!'' attitude of those who would regulate just for regulation and bureaucracy's sake. 
   As a Senator, I am nonplused at the Administration's gall in asking for a 16 percent increase to beef up its attack-dog department so that it may continue mauling the greatest engine for revenue generation we've seen in many a year. 
   As a Washingtonian, I am incensed at the blatant attempt of AL GORE's wannabe administration to court my state's electoral votes even as his current Administration's Justice Department orchestrates the destruction of Washington's superb economic engine in favor of Silicon Valley's greater financial and electoral prize. 
   Yes, this case offends me in every sense of the word, as it should offend every one of my colleagues. I call on each of them today to recognize what is at risk here, to rise above partisan posturing, to recognize the outrageous nature of the Justice Department's power grab, and to join me in stopping it. 
   Because that is precisely what I intend to do: I will seek to stop the Justice Department's grab for more funding through the Appropriations Committee when there are basic law enforcement needs going unfunded. I intend to conduct Congressional oversight authority of the Department's out-of-control antitrust division in every committee in which it is appropriate, and I will seek out every other legitimate vehicle to provide Congressional control of this out-of-control, time-warped throwback to the 60s. 
   I call on my colleagues to join me today in demanding accountability from a Justice Department that asserts consumer harm in the presence of consumer bounty; that has sought to destroy competition in the name of competition; and that now seeks to increase its own battle force with taxpayer dollars for a undertaking that taxpayers do not want undertaken. 
   This is a Justice Department out of control, and not only with respect to Microsoft. They are also going after Visa and MasterCard. Their Equally hidebound colleagues at the FTC are suing chip manufacturer, Intel, and investigating router manufacturer, Cisco. Most of absurd of all the Department of Justice of the United States of America has accused the country's leading manufacturer of false teeth (Dentsply) of illegally maintaining a monopoly. No wonder Justice is asking for more money and more lawyers; it needs to find more teeth to feed its rapidly burgeoning lawsuit appetite. 
   Mr. President, the Department of Justice seeks to fix what is not broken, to intervene where innovation has been the unchallenged king, and to shunt off to a dead-end track the principal engine of America's technological leadership in the world. 
   The Department of Justice, and not Microsoft, must be stopped. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation amending the 1933 Export Apple and Pear Act to provide for the expansion of pear exports. 
   Currently, all apple and pear exporters must follow the guidelines set forth in the Act when negotiating overseas sales of these commodities. According to the Act, only high grade apples and pears are to be sold in foreign markets. Should an exporter decide to broker a deal with another country involving lower grade apple and pears, the U.S. Department of Agriculture must provide a waiver to farmers allowing them to do so. 
   While growers have prospered under the 1933 Export Apple and Pear Act, more and more countries have requested to purchase lower grade pears. The purpose of this legislation is to eliminate pears from the Export Apple and Pear Act allowing growers and exporters the ability to expand the market for low grade pears without having to approach USDA in each instance for a waiver. 
   There is no doubt that the Pacific Northwest fruit industry is facing a difficult year financially. I believe this bill provides one additional mechanism necessary for an economically strapped industry to access additional markets while still promoting a quality U.S. product.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this month is the 10th anniversary of the infamous Exxon Valdez oilspill. On March 24, 1989, one of Exxon's largest tankers, under the command of a captain who had been drinking and had abandoned the bridge, struck Bligh Reef and spilled 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound. 
   The Exxon Valdez oilspill remains the largest man-made environmental disaster in American history. The oil spread almost 600 miles, harming wildlife, closing fisheries, and damaging the subsistence way of life of Alaska Natives living in the region. To its credit, Exxon spent as much as $2-3 billion trying to rectify the effects of the spill, but much damage remains. 
   The spill brought home to all of us in the Pacific Northwest a deeper appreciation for the importance of preventing oilspills. Clean water, a vibrant fishery, and abundant wildlife are all parts of our Northwest way of life, and they are all at risk to oilspills. 
   In Commerce Committee hearings shortly after the spill, I told the Exxon CEO that a Japanese CEO would have been expected to resign after such a calamity. I said this not to be unkind, but because of my strongly-held view that oilspills caused by a company's reckless conduct cannot be tolerated. 
   It is now 10 years later, and Exxon is ready to move on. It has announced its intention to merge with Mobil, creating the largest corporation in the world, with annual revenues of over $180 billion. 
   The federal government is in the process of reviewing this proposed merger. I object to the merger of Exxon and Mobil unless Exxon first resolves some important unfinished business resulting from the 1989 spill. That unfinished business is the litigation brought by the tens of thousands of fishermen, small business owners, and Alaska Natives who were harmed by the spill. 
   About 6,500 of these people live in Washington State. They, too, would like to move on with their lives, but they can't. They have been waiting ten years since the spill, and almost five years since a federal jury determined that Exxon should pay them over $5 billion. 
   They will be waiting a lot longer if Exxon has its way. Every year of delay is worth about $400 million to Exxon, the difference between the 6 percent interest rate on the $5 billion judgment and Exxon's own rate of return of about 14 percent on the same $5 billion. If this case drags on long enough, Exxon will be able to pay most of the jury verdict out of money that it made solely because of the delay in paying the judgment. 
   Exxon has appealed the jury verdict, raising a number of issues. This is to be expected in a case involving this much money. But while this case crawls through our court system, the victims are left waiting for closure to a horrible event that changed their lives forever, and they are waiting for a sense that justice has been done. We need to find a way to meet these perfectly understandable human needs. Exxon has the power and resources to make that happen. 
   We need to send the strongest possible message to Exxon and other oil companies: you use our waterways to transport your product, and you know the consequences if your product spills, so it is your duty to take every precaution. If you act recklessly, you will pay dearly. 
   That message is fading after 10 years, and will be largely lost after a merger of these proportions. Now, before the merger, we have an opportunity to make an indelible impression on what would be the largest corporation on Earth--that an oilspill like this must never happen again.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, I will introduce legislation that will build on current scientific advances in understanding autism and will promote additional research in this promising field. I introduced a very similar bill last year and am greatly encouraged by the progress in this field. In the last 12 months, we've seen an increase in the number of researchers interested in this field, additional funding for autism research and greater public awareness about this disability. It is  my hope that we can continue this momentum and pass meaningful legislation this year. 
   Many think autism is rare. In fact, it is the third most prevalent childhood disability, affecting an estimated four hundred thousand Americans and their families. It is also a condition that doctors and scientists believe can be cured. It is not something that we simply must accept. 
   When people think of autism they might remember the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie ``Rainman.'' Yet autism has many faces; it affects people from every background, social and ethnic category. Children with autism may be profoundly retarded and may never learn to speak, while other may be extremely hyperactive and bright. Some may have extraordinary talents, such as an exceptional memory or skill in mathematics. However, all share the common traits of difficulty with communication and social interaction. And for reasons we do not yet understand, eighty percent of those with autism are males. 
   But autism is not about statistics or medical definitions--it is about children and families. The Kruegers, from Washington state, have an all too typical story. Their little girl Chanel developed like any other child--she happily played with her parents, took her first steps, learned some of her first words and then she started to regress. In four short months, by the time she was two, Chanel had become almost completely enveloped in her own private world. Chanel's mother told me ``it was like somebody came in the middle of the night and took my child.'' 
   Like many children with autism, the Krueger's daughter no longer responded when her parents called her name; words she once spoke clearly became garbled; and socializing became more and more difficult. Fortunately, due to her parents' dedication and intervention Chanel Krueger at age 5, is doing remarkably well. 
   But, many autistic children completely lose the ability to interact with the outside world. The hours these kids should be spending in little league or playing with their friends are often spent staring out the window, transfixed by the dust floating in the sunlight or the pattern of leaves on the ground. 
   Even today, with advances in therapy and early intervention, few of these children will go to college, hold a regular job, live independently or marry. More than half never learn how to speak. 
   The facts about autism can be sobering--but there is hope. Early intervention and treatment has helped many children. Science has also made great strides in understanding this disorder. We 
   now know that autism is a biological condition, it is not an emotional problem and it is not caused by faulty parenting. Scientists believe that autism is one of the most heritable developmental disorders and is the most likely to benefit from the latest advances in genetics and neurology. Once the genetic link is discovered, the opportunities for understanding, treating, and eventually curing autism are endless. 
   The promise of research is exactly why I am introducing this legislation. This bill will increase the federal commitment to autism research. Its cornerstone is authorization for five Centers of Excellence where basic researchers, clinicians and scientists can come together to increase our understanding of this devastating disorder. 
   Because so little is known about the prevalence of autism, I have added a provision that establishes at the Centers for Disease Control at least three centers of expertise on autism in an effort to identify the causes of autism. The epidemiology research will help us confirm or dismiss whether a genetic disposition to autism may be triggered by environmental factors. If so, identifying those factors may help us in taking steps to prevent autism from developing. 
   A library of genetic information will be a valuable tool for researchers trying to identify the genetic basis for autism. The bill includes a provision to fund a gene and brain tissue bank developed from families affected with autism to be available for research purposes. 
   While we are hoping to advance our understanding and treatment of autism through research, it is also important that pediatricians and other health professionals have the most current information so that children and their families can receive help as early as possible. The bill includes authorization for an Autism Wareness Program to educate doctors and other health professionals about autism. 
   Finally, it is vital that we encourage collaboration among the scientists conducting this important work throughout the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill establishes an Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee to bring together the scientists at the various Institutes at the NIH, at the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies conducting autism research. 
   While the focus of this bill is on autism, advances in this area are also likely to shed light on related problems such as attention deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorders, and various seizure disorders and learning disabilities. 
   Research is the key to unlocking the door and freeing those with autism from the isolation and loneliness of their private world. This bill is intended to give the NIH and the CDC the resources to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity before us to find more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for autism. The promise is real. Fulfillment of that promise only requires our commitment. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this important investment in the future of our children and our Nation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Y2K problem should not be underestimated. Before the session began, Senator MCCAIN and I committed to working on legislation that will allow entities to focus their efforts on remediation and prevent unproductive litigation. We have solicited and obtained input from sources representing both potential plaintiffs and potential defendants in Y2K actions. We want to continue listening and working on this issue, but do not have much time--the countdown had begun. The draft measure that we are putting on the record today reflects principally the measure proposed by a large coalition of business groups including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Business, and many others. The draft will, I hope, invite more feedback, and focus the efforts of all interested parties. I invite our colleagues and all interested parties to continue to provide us with comments and suggestions so that we can improve the measure before it is marked up by the Commerce Committee on March 3.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted on an amendment to S. 4 offered by my colleague Senator CRAPO from Idaho. I voted ``present.'' 
   The amendment would eliminate a federal law that reduces the military retirement pay of those retirees who continue their public service by working for the federal government as civilians. As a Senator who would personally benefit from the amendment's passage, I am subject to a clear conflict of interest and thus cannot properly vote. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I am retired Air Force Reserve officer. As such, my retirement pay from the Air Force would increase significantly if the Crapo amendment were signed into law. With that in mind, I voted present.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I recognize the Tukwila School District from my home state of Washington and the district's ``New Friends & Families'' program. 
   The Tukwila School District has seen its ethnic diversity grow by more than 1,000 percent in the last seven years. Out of the district's 2,500 pupils, 50% are students of color, 20% are enrolled in bilingual education, and all told, they speak about 30 different languages. To meet the challenge of integrating this immigrant population into the school system and the community, the Tukwila School District, the City of Tukwila, and the local Rotary Club created ``New Friends & Families.'' It is a one-night, once a year program designed to engage these hard-to-reach immigrant and refugee students and their families to make them aware of community services and to encourage parental involvement in their children's education. 
   Clearly, when more than 20% of Tukwila's students are unfamiliar with their new surroundings, they face a serious impediment to quality learning. The ``New Friends & Families'' program has met this challenge head on with local creativity, local initiative, and local resources. This shows that local communities know best how to deal with unique local problems. By teaming up with local government and local businesses, the school district has found innovative ways to turn its challenges into successful education. 
   It is programs like ``New Friends & Families'' that illustrate that local innovation works in our schools. The answer to improving our local schools is not more intrusion and red tape from Washington, DC bureaucracies but rather, more freedom and more flexibility for local educators to use federal resources to meet the unique needs of each community in teaching our kids. During last week's recess, I visited Foster High School in the Tukwila District and presented my first ``Innovation in Education Award'' to Superintendent Michael Silver in recognition of the creative work he and his district have accomplished through ``New Friends & Families.'' 
   To recognize the importance of local communities in educating our children, I will be presenting this ``Innovation in Education Award'' once a week to recognize individuals, schools, and educational programs in Washington state that demonstrate the importance of local control in education. I will also take to the floor of the Senate every week to share with my colleagues these examples of locally driven successes in education in an effort to remind all of us working here in Washington, DC that local communities really do know best. 
   For the past 35 years, Washington, DC's response to crises in public education has been to create one new program after another--systematically increasing the federal role in classrooms across the country. While the federal government has a role in targeting resources to needy populations and in holding schools accountable for results, it should not tie the hands of districts like Tukwila. That only serves to stifle the local innovation that is fundamental to educational success. I have long been an advocate of local control in education and I plan to introduce legislation this spring that will transfer more control from federal agencies back to local educators where it belongs.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the statement that I am placing in the record is the statement I would have given had I been permitted to speak longer and in open session. During our closed deliberations, I gave a similar, but abridged statement. 
   For almost two years, the President of the United States was engaged in what he has come to describe as an ``inappropriate intimate'' relationship with a young woman who came to his attention as a White House intern. He then lied about their relationship, publicly, privately, formally, informally, to the press, to the country, and under oath, for a period of about a year. 
   This course of conduct requires us to face four distinct questions. 
   First, we must determine if the material facts alleged in the Articles of Impeachment have been established to our satisfaction. 
   Second, do the established facts constitute either obstruction of justice or perjury, or both? 
   Third, are obstruction of justice and perjury high Crimes and Misdemeanors under the Constitution? 
   And, fourth, even if the acts of the president are high Crimes and Misdemeanors, are they of sufficient gravity to warrant his conviction if it allows of no alternative other than his removal from office? 
   The first article of impeachment alleges that the President committed perjury while testifying before the Starr grand jury. Although the House Managers assert that his testimony is replete with false statements, it is clear, at the least, that his representations about the nature and details of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky are literally beyond belief. 
   From November 1995, until March 1997, the President engaged in repeated sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky, who was first a volunteer at and then an employee of the White House and eventually the Pentagon. Though he denies directly few of her descriptions of those activities, he testified under oath that he did not have ``sexual relations'' with her. His accommodation of this paradox is based on the incredible claim that he did not touch Miss Lewinsky with any intent to arouse or gratify anyone sexually, even though she performed oral sex on him. 
   It seems to me strange that any rational person would conclude that the President's description of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky did not constitute perjury. 
   In addition, while we are not required to reach our decision on these charges beyond a reasonable doubt, I have no reasonable doubt that the President committed perjury on a second such charge when he told the grand jury that the purpose of the five statements he made to Mrs. Currie after his Jones deposition was to refresh his own memory. 
   The President knew that each statement was a lie. His goal was to get Mrs. Currie to concur in those lies. 
   The other allegations of perjury are either unproven--particularly those requiring a strict incorporation of the president's Jones deposition testimony into his grand jury testimony--or are more properly considered solely--with those already discussed--as elements of the obstruction of justice charges in Article II. 
   To determine that the president perjured himself at least twice, however, is not to decide the ultimate question of guilt on Article I. That I will discuss later. 
   All the material allegations of Article II seem to me to be well founded. Four of them, however, those regarding the president's encouraging Miss Lewinsky to file a false affidavit and then to give false testimony, those regarding the president's failure to correct his attorney's false statements to the Jones court, and those bearing upon the disposal of his gifts to her are not, in my mind, proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Again, I do not believe this standard to be required in impeachment trials, but because I believe that the other three factual allegations of Article II do meet that standard, I adopt it for the purposes of this discussion.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will restore payment equity to Pacific Northwest producers of club wheat. 
   Last year, during the middle of the 1998 harvest season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture made a rule change regarding the Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) club wheat, a member of the soft white wheat subclass. While I applaud USDA for its efforts in providing equal payments for club wheat and soft white wheat, by making the policy change in the middle of the production year, many club wheat producers had already contracted with the lower payment. 
   In order to address the inequity between the 1998 club wheat LDP contracts, my colleagues and I requested that USDA make the policy retroactive. USDA claimed it does not have the authority to grant retroactivity, and as a result, I have introduced this legislation to provide the agency retroactive authority.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and congratulate Nathan Schacht of Walla Walla, Washington, who was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout rank, the Boy Scout of America's highest honor, on January 19, 1999. 
   Nathan is the son of Don and Margaret Schacht and a sophomore at DeSales Catholic High School. He began scouting five years ago with the Eastgate Lions Troop 305 and moved onto the Cub Scout program with Pack 309. 
   Nathan and I share a common love for the outdoors. During his tenure with the Boy Scouts he logged over 70 miles of hiking and 70 miles of canoeing; earned the 50 Miler Afloat award; camped 63 nights and earned 31 merit badges. He recently completed his term as Senior Patrol Leader for Troop 305. He has been a member of the Order of the Arrow since 1996 and was awarded his Eagle Cap Credentials in 1997. 
   His Eagle project involved building a recycling center for Assumption Elementary School. He spent over 115 hours planning and carrying out this  project which included contacting donors for the materials and working with the volunteers in all phases of the project. He secured over $700 in donated materials and 261 hours of volunteer time. 
   Nathan also participates in other activities in his school and community. He participates in the football, basketball, and golf programs at DeSales High School, as well as band, drama and National Honor Society. He has served as a page in the Washington State House of Representatives and as an altar server for the past seven years at Assumption Catholic Church. 
   I am confident that Nathan will continue to be a positive role model among his peers, a leader in his community and a friend to those in need. I extend my sincerest congratulations and best wishes to him. His achievement of Eagle Scout and significant contributions to the Walla Walla community are truly outstanding.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Saturday, together with my colleagues Senators KERRY, JEFFORDS, HOLLINGS, THURMOND, HARKIN, MURRAY, SMITH of Oregon, JOHNSON, and WYDEN. I introduced ``The Bond Fairness and Protection Act of 1999.'' This is a bi-partisan compromise approach to legislation addressing the tax consequences of electricity restructuring on tax-exempt bonds that are issued by municipally-owned or state-owned utilities (often referred to as ``publicly-owned'' utilities) for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. 
   As my colleagues may recall, last Congress I introduced a substantially similar bill, S. 2182, with eleven cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress did not have an opportunity to address this or other proposals on electricity restructuring. This year we have worked to simplify and refine last year's legislation in response to thoughtful comments we received last year, and in an effort to facilitate timely consideration of the legislation in this Congress. 
   Despite the lack of Federal legislation in this policy area, 18 states have already gone forward and begun to allow retail market choice for electricity consumers at the state and local level. The era of retail competition has already started both for publicly-owned and investor-owned utilities operating in these states. 
   Until recently, publicly-owned utilities have been able to operate under a strict regime of Federal tax rules governing their ability to issue tax-exempt bonds. These rules were enacted in an era when decision makers did not contemplate retail or wholesale electricity competition. These so-called ``private use'' rules limit the amount of electricity that publicly-owned utilities may sell to private entities through facilities that are financed with tax-exempt bonds. For years, the private use rules were cumbersome but manageable. As states move to restructure the electricity industry however, the private use rules were threatening many public power communities with significant financial penalties as they adjust to the changing marketplace. In effect, the rules are forcing publicly-owned utilities to face the prospects of violating the private use rules, or walling off their customers from competition. In either case, this will raise rates for consumers--the precise opposite of what restructuring is intended to achieve. The consumer can only lose when the marketplace operates in this inefficient manner. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today would protect all consumers by grandfathering outstanding tax-exempt bonds, but only if the issuing municipality or state utility elects to terminate permanently its ability to issue tax-exempt debt to build new generating facilities. Such an election would not affect transmission and distributions facilities, which generally would still be regulated under most restructuring proposals or frameworks. Publicly-owned utilities that do not make this irrevocable election would continue to operate under a clarified version of exiting law, thus remaining subject to the private use rules. 
   This legislation attempts to balance and be fair to the interests of all stakeholders in electricity restructuring while keeping the interest of the consumer paramount. It strikes a compromise between publicly-owned utilities and investor-owned utilities by providing an option for publicly-owned utilities to address the problem of how to comply with private use restriction in a restructured marketplace, an option that involves significant trade-offs for the publicly-owned utilities that seek to utilize it. For investor-owned utilities, requiring publicly-owned utilities to forego the ability to issue tax-exempt debt for new generation facilities should mitigate any potential or perceived competitive advantage in the new competitive world. At the same time, it honors promises made to bondholders under contract and existing tax law, thereby avoiding the inequitable consequence of applying old rules to the newly-emerging competitive world of electricity. 
   In addition, for those concerned about the environment, it provides incentives to deliver electricity efficiently through open access and retail  competition. Most importantly, for consumers the legislation allows competition to thrive while providing additional local options. 
   Mr. President, we plan to work with all interested parties, and most importantly American consumers, to ensure that we develop the fairest and most reasonable solution to this complex problem. We want electricity restructuring to be a good deal for everyone involved, especially the American consumer who deserves the lower electric bills that a competitive marketplace should provide. I believe this legislation addresses all of these concerns and promotes fair competition in the electricity industry. I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the federal government has done quite enough to impede states efforts to recover damages from and change the practices of tobacco manufacturers. Though they asked, the state Attorneys General received no help from the federal government in their litigation. When, despite this, the states in mid-1997 proposed to settle their claims for almost $400 billion and asked the Administration and Congress to codify the agreement, the federal government instead blew it up by spending the states' money, and then some, on this Administration's pet social projects. It was only through the ingenuity, hard work, and unwavering perseverance of people like Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire that states were able to take the tobacco manufacturers back to the table in late 1998 and obtain a settlement agreement for $206 billion. 
   Though it did none of the work, the Administration now wants to share in the reward. Using an old provision in the Social Security Act, a provision that I understand was intended to permit federal Medicaid recoupment in cases of fraud or over billing, the federal government is now claiming over 50% of the states' settlement money. To exact what it claims is its share, the Administration intends to withhold Medicaid payments, payments that go to the neediest residents of Washington and other states. 
   This is no idle threat: three days ago, the President sent us a budget in which he spent $16 billion of the states' settlement money in the next five years. The President did indicate, however, that he would relinquish this claim to the money for one year if states agree to spend the money as he and other Washington, D.C. bureaucrats see fit. This is just wrong. 
   The bill that we are introducing today rights this wrong. It allows states to keep the monies they fought for. No strings attached. The federal government has not earned this money, and does not know better than states how it should be spent. I urge my colleagues to join me and my friends from Texas and Florida in seeing that this bill is passed this session.

   Mr. GORTON. Mr. President. In 1997, Congress and the President agreed to provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an incentive to states to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To receive this money, states must expand eligibility levels to children living in families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. 
   Washington State has a strong record of ensuring that its low-income kids have access to health care. Five years ago, my state decided to do what Congress and the President have just last year required other states to do. In 1994, Washington expanded its child Medicaid eligibility level to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) all the way through to the age of 18. 
   During the negotiations of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA), Congress and the Administration recognized that certain states were already undertaking Medicaid expansions up to or above 200 percent of FPL, and that they would be allowed to use the new SCHIP funds. Unfortunately, this provision was limited to those states that enacted expansions on or after March 31, 1997 and disallowed Washington from accessing the $230 million in SCHIP funds it had been allocated through 2002. As a result, Washington State cannot use its SCHIP allotment to cover the 90,000 children currently eligible, but not covered for health care at or below 200 percent of poverty. Exacerbating this inequity is the fact that many states have begun accessing their SCHIP allotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below Washington's current or past eligibility levels. 
   The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator MURRAY, corrects this technicality and is a top priority for the Washington State delegation in the 106th Congress. Congresswoman DUNN has introduced a companion measure in the House of Representatives that is cosponsored by the entire Washington delegation. 
   This bipartisan, bicameral initiative represents a thoughtful, carefully-crafted response to the unintended consequences of SCHIP and brings much needed assistance to children currently at risk. Rather than simply changing the effective date included in the BBA, this initiative includes strong maintenance of effort language as well as incentives for our state to find those 90,000 uninsured kids because we feel strongly that they receive the health coverage for which they are eligible. 
   This bill does not take money from other states nor does it provide additional federal subsidies for children the state is now covering, it simply allows Washington to continue to do the good work they have already started by focusing on new, uninsured children at low income levels first.

    Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Air Transportation Improvement Act. This bill would provide a two-year authorization for the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). As Senator MCCAIN has noted, this bill is almost exactly the same as S. 2279, which the Senate passed last September by a vote of 92 to one. The only differences are technical in nature. 
   I would like to commend Senator MCCAIN for moving quickly to deal with FAA reauthorization in a timely manner. If no action is taken, the AIP will expire on March 31, 1999, and airports will not receive much needed federal grants that would allow them to continue to operate both safely and efficiently. The Air Transportation Improvement Act would establish contract authority for the program. Without this authority in place, the FAA cannot distribute airport grants, regardless of whether an AIP appropriation is in place. A lapse in the AIP is unacceptable, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that this does not occur. 
   Mr. President, this bill reaffirms our commitment that the United States should continue to have the safest and most efficient air transportation system in the world. Although the role of Congress is vital, the FAA has the immediate responsibility for managing the national air transportation system. In very broad terms, the FAA is directly responsible for ensuring the safety, security, and efficiency of civil aviation, and for overseeing the development of a national airports system. 
   One critical activity being performed by the FAA is modernization of the air traffic control (ATC) system. This process has been ongoing for 15 years, and will continue for many years into the future. During my tenure as Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I have learned that the modernization program is at a critical juncture. We can no longer allow the program to continue the ``stops and starts'' of the past. Improvements must get on track, or the growing demand for air services combined with outdated equipment will soon bring gridlock and serious concerns about safety. 
   I am encouraged that the FAA is working with industry to put the ATC modernization program on track and develop a plan to deliver equipment, on time and on budget, that will ensure increased safety and efficiency for all Americans. This bill will help ensure that these very important efforts continue. The FAA must spare no effort over the next few years to modernize the ATC system, as airlines will also be spending a great deal of money to purchase and install the components needed in their aircraft to use these new systems. All of this needs to be done right, and done now, to ensure continued safety and efficiency in the aviation industry. 
   Another matter requiring immediate attention is the FAA's progress in dealing with the Year 2000 problem. This issue has far reaching safety and economic implications, and has already been the subject of many hearings in Congress. It is imperative that the FAA makes the 
   most out of limited time and resources, and Congress must ensure that this is a top priority. The public is aware of the Year 2000 problem and must be reassured beyond any doubt that it will be possible to fly and, most importantly, to fly in complete safety, on January 1, 2000. 
   As I already mentioned, this bill contains numerous provisions designed to improve competition and service in the airline industry. The inclusion of these measures in the bill does not in any way mean that airline deregulation has been unsuccessful. The overall benefits of airline deregulation are clear: fares are down significantly and service options have increased. 
   Many of the benefits of deregulation can be attributed to the entry of new airlines into the marketplace. The low  fare carriers have increased competition, and have enabled more people to fly than ever before. Air traffic has grown as a result, and all predictions are that it will continue to grow steadily over the next several years. 
   In spite of the success of deregulation, many believe that competition can be improved. The competition provisions in the Air Transportation Improvement Act would ease some of the federally-imposed barriers that remain in the deregulated environment. These barriers include the slot controls at four major airports and the perimeter rule at Reagan National Airport. 
   Although this legislation is a positive step forward for our national aviation system, one of my main priorities, which is not included in the Air Transportation Improvement Act, will be to push for an increase in the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) cap. We must address the widening infrastructure gap that threatens to hamstring our national aviation system. The independent National Civil Aviation Review Commission and the GAO also estimate that there is a backlog in airport improvements of approximately $3 billion per year. To ensure that our infrastructure deficit can be met, we must look for innovative solutions such as a PFC increase which allow local control and responsibly for improving our national aviation system. 
   I look forward to working with Senators MCCAIN, HOLLINGS, and ROCKEFELLER to ensure that our common goals of providing a safe and secure aviation system for both commercial airlines and the general aviation community as well as providing adequate resources for the FAA to carry out this task are met.
